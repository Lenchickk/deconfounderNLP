BASIC TEXT PREPROCESSING

EXISTING INPUT: MULTIPLE FILES with congressional speeches (with a small flaw in their formatting) 
and news transcripts (highly unstructured)

DESIRED OUTPUT: ONE (or maybe more than ONE but not as many as now) CSV FILE for congressional speeches and 
news transcripts for each channel well structured and that can be directly supplied to the code 
provided in text_vectorization.ipynb. 

(keep only data for 2005-2012)

   schema for congressional speeches:
   <senator code*> , <date>**, <text of the speech WITHOUT COMMAS> 
   * i.e H_IN_HOLMAN_1859_1859_0055 - don't parse it so far; keep it the way it is for now
   ** don't parse, just collect the way it is, i.e 1859-01-01
   
   schema for channel transcripts:
   <date in the same format as **>, <all transcripts for this date for this channel without commas>
