remarks andinsert extraneous materials on the bill under consideration Speaker I rise in support of this bill and yieldmyself such time as I may consumeMr Speaker Congress instructed FEMA in the PostKatrina EmergencyManagement Reform Act of 2006 and in the Implementing Recommendationsof the 911 Commission Act of 2007 to develop performance metrics forits homeland security grants programs As the House Committee onHomeland Security discovered in our October 27 subcommittee hearing Iheld with my ranking member hearing on emergency communications theserequirements remain poorly implemented and difficult to comprehendWhat is most disconcerting is that FEMA still cannot determine ourNations overall preparedness or how homeland security grants havehelped to protect our Nation from acts of terrorismIt is for these reasons that I come to you today to ask for yoursupport of HR 3980 the Redundancy Elimination and EnhancementPerformance for Preparedness Grants Act This legislation would requireFEMA to work in conjunction with State local tribal and territorialstakeholders to develop a plan to do the following thingsStreamline homeland security grant reporting requirements rules andregulations to eliminate redundant reportingCreate a strategy including a timetable for establishing the muchneeded performance metrics for grant programs to ensure that the fundsare being directed to the areas where they will be best spentRequire FEMA to take an inventory of each of the homeland securitygrant programs to include the purpose objectives and performance goalsfor eachThe plan will be submitted to the appropriate congressionalcommittees no later than 120 days after the bills enactmentIt will be updated biannually to ensure that the committee is able tomaintain a watchful eye and the oversight on redundancies in the lawthat might confuse the grant recipients at the local levelThis bill will help identify inefficiencies with the DHS grantsprograms and this bill will increase the quality of service received byDHS grant recipientsI urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislationHouse of Representatives Committee on Transportation andInfrastructureWashington

S_VT_LEAHY,2009-12-11, President I ask unanimous consent that the order forthe quorum call be rescinded President Division F of this omnibus conferenceagreement provides funding for the State Department ForeignOperations and related programsI want to thank the ranking member of the subcommittee SenatorGregg and his very capable staff Paul Grove and Michele Wymer foronce again working with me and my staff in a bipartisan manner toproduce this conference agreementI also want to thank Chairwoman Nita Lowey and Ranking Member KayGranger and their staffs for working so cooperatively with usthroughout this processThe fiscal year 2010 State Foreign Operations conference agreementprovides 488 billion in discretionary funding a 33 billiondecrease from the Presidents budget request of 52 billionThe bill is 12 billion below the fiscal year 2009 level includingsupplemental funds This is an important point that needs to beunderstood by all Senators because yesterday a Senator on the otherside of the aisle criticized this bill for being 31 percent abovefiscal year 2009That is misleading because it does not account for the billions ofdollars in fiscal year 2009 emergency supplemental funding that wasthe standard way of doing business under the previous administrationTo ignore those costs to American taxpayers is disingenuousPresident Obama has made clear that he intends to fund these programson budget not through supplemental gimmicks That is what the Congressurged him to do and now he is being criticized for doing soIf you compare apples to apples this bill provides 12 billion lessspending than in fiscal year 2009Some Republican Senators have made speeches against this omnibuspackage on account of earmarks they dont like even though some ofthem requested their own earmarks In fact earmarks comprise a tinyfraction of the total packageLike past years the StateForeign Operations conference agreementdoes not contain any earmarks as defined by the AppropriationsCommitteeWe do fund many programs that are priorities of Democrats andRepublicans including assistance for countries like AfghanistanPakistan and Iraq and longstanding allies like Israel Egypt andJordanIn addition the conference agreement provides 57 billion to combatHIVAIDS including 750 million for the Global Fund Funds areprovided to combat other diseases like malaria tuberculosis andneglected tropical diseasesThe agreement provides 12 billion for climate change andenvironment programs including for clean energy programs and toprotect forestsThe agreement provides 12 billion for agriculture and food securityprograms with authority to provide additional fundsThere are provisions dealing with corruption and human rightsfunding for international organizations like the United Nations NATOand the International Atomic Energy Agency and to promote democracyeconomic development and the rule of law from Central America toCentral AsiaThe conference agreement provides the funds to support our embassiesand diplomats around the world public diplomacy and broadcastingprograms the Peace Corps and many other programs that promote UnitedStates interestsI dont support everything in this omnibus package any more thananyone else does I had hoped as I know did Chairman Inouye and ViceChairman Cochran that we could have brought each of the bills in thisomnibus including the StateForeign Operations bill to the Senatefloor individuallyBut a handful of Senators on the other side have made clear that theywill do whatever is procedurally possible to slow down or preventconsideration of these billsDespite that I can say that the State Foreign Operations conferenceagreement was negotiated with the full participation of both House andSenate chairmen and ranking members It was in every sense acollaborative processIt is a balanced agreement and should be supported by every Senatorwho cares about US security and the security of our allies andfriends around the world   President I want to briefly discuss a subject thatshould interest all Senators concerning the country of El Salvadorwhich recently elected a new President and last month sufferedextensive loss of life and devastating property damage as a result oftorrential rains caused by Hurricane IdaFirst I congratulate the people of El Salvador on the electionwhich was historic in that President Funes is the countrys firstPresident since the end of the civil war who is a member of the FMLNwhich after the 1992 Peace Accords evolved from an armed insurgencyinto a political party I am encouraged by what I have heard aboutPresident Funes policies and wish him the bestSecond the destruction caused by Hurricane Ida was extensiveExceptionally heavy and constant rain fell on November 7 and 8resulting in flooding and landslides that killed 192 people Another 80were reported missing and more than 14295 others were displaced fromtheir homes Thousands of homes as well as roads bridges and otherpublic buildings were damaged or destroyedOn November 10 US Charge dAffaires Robert Blau declared adisaster in response to the damage and the US Agency forInternational Development has so far allocated some 280851 inhumanitarian aid An assessment of thetotal damage is underway but it is expected to be in the hundreds ofmillions if not billions of dollarsCongressman Jim MCGovern and I have urged the administration toprovide additional aid We remember how the US Government all butforgot about El Salvador after the war ended and this is a time tohelp the Salvadoran people recover from this tragedyThird an issue that has deeply concerned me for many years is theproblem of corruption and impunity in El Salvador The police and thecourts lack the training and resources they need crimes are rarelysolved and perpetrators are rarely punished Violent crime andcorruption have become endemic El Salvadors democratic and economicdevelopment will continue to be impeded by a justice system that isincapable of enforcing the rule of law and in which the Salvadoranpeople and foreign investors have little confidenceOne of the courageous Salvadorans who is trying to change this is MsZaira Navas inspector general of the National Police She has awoefully inadequate budget and too few staff But despite that fromeverything I have heard she is doing an outstanding job for justice andthe people of El SalvadorI mention Ms Navas because of the critical importance of the job sheis doing and because she has recently received death threats and I amconcerned for her safety I urge officials at the US Embassy todiscuss with President Funes what steps can be taken immediately toprovide her the security she needs and to increase the budget of herofficeEl Salvador is a small country but one with which the US has a longhistory We both have newly elected presidents and I am hopeful thatwe will see a renewed effort to work together to broaden our relationsNothing in my view is more important than strengthening the rule oflaw and supporting people like Ms Navas but we should also expand ourcollaboration in health education and exchanges the environmenttrade and investment science and technology the arts and culture
S_AZ_MCCAIN,2009-12-05,I yield to the Senator from Tennessee  It is a lot of fun isnt it  Based on the principle that a fight not joined is a fightnot enjoyed  I will yield for one more but we have other Senators whowish to speak  I would like to finish my answer to you if I may thatis I dont know the deal that was cut with them but we will find outI know Bertha Milliard was not there when the deal was cut thatgenerated that letter That is my answer   President I ask unanimous consent that the Senatorfrom Utah the Senator from Kentucky the Senator from New Hampshirethe Senator from Georgia the Senator from Florida and the Senatorfrom Wyoming be allowed to participate in a colloquy President very quickly I wish to remind mycolleagues that the AARP continues to be referred to as endorsing thislegislation and supporting it and opposing amendments that would havedone things that they in the past have supported So I urge mycolleagues to look at this Washington articleone of my favoritesources of information and opinion the Washington PostBut not advertised in this lobbying campaign have beenAARPs substantial earnings from insurance royalties and thepotential benefits that would come its way from many otherreformsSo we have been looking into that and guess what The AARPendorsement of more than 400 billion in Medicare savingsaccording toits own financial statements from 2008 AARP generated 38 percent ofits 11 billion in revenue or more than 414 million in royalty feesThey also obviously willif we take away Medicare Advantage thenMedigap sales will have to go up because that provides for the servicesthat are being taken away So under the AARP they would generate intheir endorsementsthey have generated 414 million putting them infifth place of all of the health insurance companies in America behindUnited Health Wellpoint Aetna and Humana So we have before the bodyan amendment that would modify any health insurers remuneration to thesame level as the salary of the President of the United StatesSo I ask unanimous consent at this time that the AARP executives beadded in under the effect of this pending amendment from the Senatorfrom Arkansas  President I also understand that Walmart sellshealth insurance policies They are based in Arkansas I ask unanimousconsent that Walmart be included in this curb on excessive remunerationthat will now place them under the same level  It is peoplewho sell health insurance  I am sorry the Senator from Montana cannot understandthat they are people who sell health insurance as well AARP doesWalmart does If we are going to have this kind of demagogic amendmentthen we should include them especially Walmart that does a lot ofbusiness  I would say to my colleague they not only opposed itthey got all of their members fired up in opposition to it We allheard from them back in 2005 These were reductions in spending Thiswas not 438 billion taken out of Medicare and put in to create a newentitlement program of 25 trillion  I think the Senator fromNew Hampshire recalls that debate  My quick answer is I dont know what the deal was but Iknow the people who are in the home health care business who will see43 billion in cuts to their business the funding for their businesswere not there when the lobbyists showed upWe have already heard the stories of the meetings you and themajority leader have had with these people saying Get on board or whenwe shape the final parameters of this bill we are going to hurt youWe know they have been threatened  There are two doctors in the Senatethere are lots of lawyers two doctors Both of them have handsonexperience I dont know if Dr Barrasso has seen this mornings NewYork Times another of my favorite sources of news information andopinion On the front page this morning Home Care Patients WorryOver Possible CutsI understand the purpose of health care reform as proposed by theother side is to reduce health care costs Is there a way to reducehealth care costs better than treating people at home than instead ofin a hospital I am curious about the Senators experience  If it is taken out of your time just exactly as youresponded when someone asked if you would yield for a question fromthem yesterday Is it taken out of your time  I ask unanimous consent that the time for the Senatorsquestion not be taken out of the time that is allotted to us  My response is I dont know what deal has been cut inSenator Reids office as the deal was cut with the pharmaceuticalcompanies and the deal was cut with the AMA and the deal was cut withthe hospital association But I know what the effect is I know whatthe effect is The bill would slice 55 billion  The House bill would slice 55 billion over 10 years forprojected Medicare spending on home health services while the Senatebill would take 43 billion I know that But I dont know the detailsof the deal that was cut over where the white smoke comes out I dontknow what the deal was I know what the deal was with PhRMA I knowwhat the deal was with PhRMA They told them they would oppose drugreimportation from Canada and they told PhRMA they would not allowcompetition for Medicare patientsSo I dont know the deal that was cut that bought them but I knowdeals have been going on and I know they are unsavory I know peoplesuch as the lady who was just referred to Bertha Milliard are not toointerested in seeing their home health care cut  I dont know what the deal was  I dont know what the deal was but we will find outjust like the deals that were cut with all of these otherorganizations  I cant walk through thehallway without bumping into one of their lobbyists If the Senatorkeeps interrupting he is violating the rules of the Senate He needsto learn the rules of the Senate The Senator from Georgia has a comment  They will probably be called up to Senator Reids officevery soon  Let me remind the Senator from Montana sometimes thereis good news and sometimes it is bad There was an article earlier thisyear where the staff of the Senator from Montana called in the highpaid lobbyists and told them not to meet with Republicans saying thatif they did it would be treated as a hostile act I can provide thatarticle for the Record I hope it is not true but I think it is  I yield to the Senator from North Carolina for a questionand then the Senator from Tennessee  Perhaps my other colleagues canexplain it betterI also want to return for a second to the question of the Senatorfrom Montana The AMA is a classic example When I go back to Arizonaand talk to doctors and providers they say What is going on You madea deal with the lobbyists That is my answer to you You made a dealwith the lobbyistsnot the home health care providers not the nursesnot the doctors the people who are the users of pharmaceuticals whothis year have seen an 8 to 9percent increase in the cost ofprescription drugsbecause your deal is going to protect them Myanswer to you is I dont know what you bought that letter for but itwas probably a pretty high priceThe Senator from I yield to the Senator from Wyoming  President how much time remains Novelli who has since steppeddownan old friendlast year was 1797751 Mr Tauzin apharmaceutical research and manufacturers lobbyist only made 15million last year Scott Serota of BlueCross BlueShield made 16million Chicken feedI yield to the Senator from Utah  I ask the Senator from New Hampshire very quickly is ityour understanding that AARP does sell health insurance and WalMartsells health insurance  Then would it make sense they would be included in theamendment to modify the limit on excessive remuneration paid by certainhealth insurance providers to set the limit at the same level as thesalary of the President of the United States Wouldnt the CEO of WalMart and the head of AARP who only made 18 million last year fallunder that umbrella   I am very reluctantto take a trip down memory lane again Could I say one of the phrasesthroughout the campaign was If you like the insurance policy you haveyou can keep it You tell me how people who now have Medicare Advantagecan keep it under this proposal It is impossibleMaybe the other side is right Maybe these reductions have to be madein Medicare Advantage Maybe those changes have to be made I donthappen to agree although cost savings should be there But no one canbelieve that you can keep the same Medicare Advantage policy that 11million seniors in America have today under this proposal It isimpossibleThe Senator from FloridaMr LeMIEUX If the Senator from Arizona will allow I want to askone question of my friend the medical doctor about infections inhospitals My understanding is that home health care is actually betterfor the patient it is better for the efficacy of the treatment becausea big problem we have in hospitals is that patients get staphinfections and other infections In fact it is one of the leadingcauses of death in a hospital You dont go in with this infection youget it thereIsnt this proposal that is going to take people out of home healthcare and send them to hospitals going to actually hurt patients  Thanks to our crack staff who are a good example of thesuccess of work release programs I remind my friend from Montana aRollcall article as of June 11Top aides to Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus called alastminute preemptive strike on Wednesday with a groupof prominent Democratic lobbyists warning them to advisetheir clients not to attend a meeting with SenateRepublicans set for ThursdayRussell SullivanWhom I dont happen to knowthe top staffer on Finance and Jon Selib Baucus chief ofstaff met with a bloc of more than 20 contract lobbyistsincluding several former Baucus aidesWho have made a nice transitionThey said Republicans are having this meeting and youneed to let all of your clients know if they have someonethere that will be viewed as a hostile act  said aDemocratic lobbyist who attended the meetingGoing to the Republican meeting will say Im interestedin working with Republicans to stop health care reform the lobbyist addedAgain PhRMA the New York Times again my favorite Tauzin the15millionperyear representative of PhRMA saidWe were assured We need somebody to come in first Ifyou come in first you will have a rocksolid deal  BillyTauzin the former Republican House member from Louisiana   said Who is ever going to get into a deal with the WhiteHouse again if they dont keep their word You are just goingto duke it out insteadThey cut a deal That is again in answer to the Senator fromMontana that is probably how they got the letter the same way Tauzinwrote his letterThe majority leaderthe minority leader hopefully majority leadersoon   Wouldnt that mean that AARP executive would naturallyfall under the Lincoln amendment  The Senator from Utah  The Senator from Tennessee  Not to mention the chief executives of the pharmaceuticalcompanies Why wouldnt we want to bring them in on it After all theyare paying for lobbyists at 17 million every year to cut these dealsat the White House that they describe on the front page of the New YorkTimesI would hope the Senator would be glad to modify her amendment toinclude all these other people who have gotten extremely wealthyPhRMA an 8percent increase in drug prices in the last year Again Irefer to the New York TimesAnyone else Senator BurrMr President how much time remains  We are going to do it again alot between now and the time the vote is forced and the Americanpeople are on our side   Madam President as much as I would like to put the lastPresidential campaign behind me we seem to be continuing to dredge itup in a totally false manner time after timeI ask unanimous consent that my campaign position paper on a specificplan of action lowering health care costs be printed in the Record Then I ask unanimous consent to have printed in theRecord a statement from FactCheckorg of October 20 2008 that saysObamas False Medicare Claim which were the attacks on me whichwere not based on fact I quote from FactCheckorgThese claims are false and based on a single newspaperreport that says no such thing MCCains policy directorstates unequivocally that no benefit cuts are envisionedMCCain does propose substantial savings   I did propose savings and we can make savings Nowhere in my wildestimagination did I ever believe we were going to cut benefits in orderto create a 25 trillion new entitlement program when the system isalready going broke I will have those put in the Record  The Senator from Massachusetts wants to distort myrecord and that is fine But it gets a little  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator fromMassachusetts be allowed 3 additional minutes and I be allowed 2additional minutes This has been a vigorous debate I see my prime adversary the Senatorfrom Illinois on the floor whom I look forward to doing battle withadditionally as well as my friend from Massachusetts The fundamentalpoint I would say to my friend from Massachusetts is that I neverenvisioned nor do I believe the American people ever envisioned wewould be cutting benefits or as the Senator says making savingsin order to transfer that to a brand new entitlement program That iswhat the debate is about whether we are going to take a failing systemthat in 7 years is going bankrupt according to the Medicare trusteesand then take all this money no matter how these savings are madeandI believe they are cuts of huge magnitudeand then fund a brandnewentitlement programThat is what this real debate is aboutI thank my friend from Massachusetts for his courtesy I look forwardto the rebuttal from the Senator from Illinois as well as the Senatorfrom Montana Thank youI yield the floorSeveral Senators addressed the Chair
S_TN_CORKER,2009-12-05,  I would rather not be any other place than on thefloor talking about the most important piece of legislation we probablywill deal with in our tenure here  President I have been listening to the debate andit is seldom that debate on the Senate floor has much impact on me Imust add But the fact is I do think this amendmentthe Lincolnamendmentis a terrible amendment We should not be voting oncompensationBut I am wondering I ask Senator MCCain if we should offer aunanimous consent agreement to change the amendment to take intoaccount AARP PhRMA and others I wonder if the other side would bewilling to take that unanimous consent request  I have never seen the Senator from Arizona ashappy as he is today in the fight against something that is sodevastatingI dont understand what it is that would cause my friends on theleft on the other side of the aisle to throw seniors under the busThere is no doubt that there ought to be some changes in Medicare tomake it more solvent We all want to ensure that seniors down theroad have the ability to benefit from Medicare no question I thinkwe have all said from day one that we want to join with Senator Greggand others to make sure Medicare is here for seniorsI do not understandI listened to the last segment of my friends onthe other side of the aisle talking about the many needs in thiscountry Many people dont have health insurance and many of us haveoffered bills to solve thatI dont understand and I hope you can explain it to me why the leftwould be willing to throw seniors under the bus Regardless of what yousay about the bill they are being thrown under the bus and doctorsare going to get a 23percent cut in a year and they are not evendealing with that and they are taking 464 billion out of MedicareWhat is it that would drive our friends on the left who in the pastnot todayhave supported seniors but today are willing to throw themunder the bus for a political victory What drives them  The Senatorfrom Arizona was highly involved in that campaign I know he offeredsome health care solutions that were greatly maligned But I think backon that and I wonder had our sitting President run on a health carereform bill that took money out of Medicare which was insolventcreated a new entitlement hurt seniors through home health eliminatedchoices making sure doctors got a 23percent cut in a year if he ranon a platform of health care reform that did thathad unfundedmandates to States raised taxesand told the American people while hewas campaigning that their premiums were going to go up I do wonder ifthe outcome would have been the sameAs a matter of fact I cannot imagine a health care policy beingpresented that is more off base than the one we are debating But onethat makes Medicare insolvent has unfunded mandates to States whenthey are troubled raises taxes and raises premiums That is what weare discussing Why my friends on the left want to give our President avictory on that basis is astounding to meI dont know but since you were up close and personal to that Iwonder if you might respond  Well I think we have a lot of time today so I thinkthat will workMr President I was wondering if the Senator from Montana mighteducate usand all seniors in this country who receive Medicareifhis intent is to make Medicare work betterand by the way I think heis in some cases working sincerely to do thatwhy is he taking thosesavings away from Medicare And being the distinguished chairman of theFinance Committee he knows as well as anybody in this country thatMedicare is insolvent Why is he not using whatever he believes to begood savingsand we may disagree with those savingsto make Medicaresolvent or at least to pay the physicians who treat Medicarerecipients They are going to get a 23percent cut next year and itwill take 250 billion just to make them equal in 10 years Why is henot using those savings to actually make Medicare work for the peoplewho are already receiving it versus leveraging all the entitlement fromone insolvent entitlement to another insolvent entitlement Why wouldthe chairman of the Finance Committee consider doing something likethat   President I noticed the senior Senator from Montanareferred to us being here and I wonder if he would yield for a veryshort question 
S_KS_BROWNBACK,2009-12-12,  Before my colleague leaves the floor I wish to askhim a question or two if he wouldnt mind He has been involved in mostof the major health issues that have passed this body in the last 15years What was the vote margin in the Senate on some of those billson the HatchKennedy HatchWaxman bills How many votes roughly I amnot asking you to pull that up from memory and it may not be fair todo As I recall a number of people on both sides of the aisle ended upsupporting those bills  In the Finance Committee   I believe you did a major health care bill withSenator Dodd from Connecticut  Do you recall the split  If I could respond to my colleague I do not know ofany I dont know of any who were even asked I know of some who weretold you can join this bill or asked thatOK can you join our billbut you dont have any input  I havent seen any at all and particularly when wetried to work in a bipartisan fashion to add Hyde language into thebill that was defeated not acceptedMy point is something I have seen the Senator say in a quote that agood health care bill should have 70 votes because it is majorlegislation that affects everybody in the United States It has hugecosts associated with it So it is not something you do on a singleparty basis it is something you work extensively on over a long periodof timeI ask my colleague again over how many years he worked with SenatorKennedy on getting the HatchKennedy bill or Waxmanmy guess is thoseare lengthy pieces of negotiations that take a period of time to getsomething that has bipartisan support  If I could ask one more question before my colleagueleavesand also a comment that I like the Senators tie nice brightcolors on a Saturday session  What does the Senator think of gettinghow many totalvotes could you get for a bipartisan health care bill along the linesof which a number of people on our side have discussed where youexpand access you try to bend the cost curve down you try to get moreaccess to lowincome individuals Does the Senator think he could crafta bipartisan bill that could get well over 60 votes on health carereform  I said I would only ask the Senator one more questionbut I have one more My question is you didnt do those bills on thefly where you were amending them sayingOK we cant quite find 60 lets go back to a closed room and letsrebuild the bill You built them over a long period of time You did agood job of working the problems out together and then you built it asit went along You didnt say OK lets do it on the fly lets changethis lets change that You build a solid piece of legislation andmove it forward not changing it at the 11th hour as we are seeing takeplace now  I thank my colleague from Utah for that explanationand also for the years of service he has given and particularly a lotof focus on health care issues I havent always agreed with mycolleague from Utah I have always found him though very sound in histhinking very knowledgeable in his ways in knowing how you do thisand particularly when you are talking about health care these arebipartisan issues in and of themselves and they need to be in thisbodyHe also talked about the principles of federalism which I think wehave deviated from in what we see from this bill I wish to read fromthe Constitution article I section 8 That is the piece I wish tofocus on here for a minute about the constitutional question involvedin this health care bill Article I section 8 reads simply this waythat the Congress shall haveand then it lists a series of enumeratedpowers power to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations and amongthe several States and with the Indian tribesThat is our ability to regulate commerce with the foreign nationsamong the several States and with the Indian tribes There are anumber of people raising the question about whether you canconstitutionally require everybody in the United States by virtue oftheir citizenship or status in the United States to have healthinsurance I think it is highly questionableIt appears to me from several legal scholars that this isunconstitutional for us to do It is a major plank in the health carelegislation that has been brought forward by the Democratic majorityand I do not believe it is going to stand constitutional challenge Iwant to develop that for my colleagues here todayThe Congressional Budget Office said this about the constitutionalquestion here They said forcing individuals to buy insurance would be    an unprecedented form of federal action Those are big wordsin a time when we are seeing a lot of what I think are unprecedentedFederal actions Then going on to say The Government has neverrequired people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawfulresidence in the United StatesYou would be requiring as a condition for lawful residence in theUnited States the purchasing of a good or a servicein this casehealth insurance As laudable as some people may look at that or saythat is that would be what is being required The Congressional BudgetOffice does not know of any time where a person in the United Stateshas been required to buy any good or service as a condition simply oflawful residence in the United States I think it raises significantconstitutional questionsYou have to remember as everybody does but I think we have toremind ourselves because too often we act as if we dont remember thatthe Federal Government is a constitutional government of limitedpowersFrom James Madison in the Federalist Papers quoted often but itbears repeating because it is a foundational issueIn the first place it is to be remembered that thegeneral government is not to be charged with the whole powerof making and administering laws Its jurisdiction is limitedto certain enumerated objectsWhich is what I just read from in article I section 8Chief Justice John Marshall in the famous Marbury v Madison casestatedThe powers of the legislature are defined and limited andthat those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten theConstitution is writtenWe cant violate that The Federal Government is limited toenumerated powers granted by the Constitution The Founding Fathers whodrafted and ratified the Constitution were unwavering in their desireto restrict the powers of States and limit the powers of Congress Toachieve their goal they created a system that splits State and Federalauthority so that one government Federal or State does not maintaintoo much power over the liberty of the American people Therefore theFramers created a system with a legislature of limited and enumeratedpowers the Congress to enact laws which shall be necessary and properfor the execution of powers One of those is the commerce clause I justread which grants Congress the authority to regulate commerce withforeign nations among the several States interstate commerce andwith Indian tribesMany have used the commerce clause to justify the implementation ofthis unconstitutional mandate Those individuals often cite the case ofWicker v Filburn a 1942 case The US Supreme Court decision foundthat a law prohibiting a commercial farmer growing an additional acreof wheat to feed chickens beyond the limits imposed on wheat productionmandated by the Federal Government was constitutional and fell underthe enumerated powers granted by the commerce clause Filburn wasordered to destroy his crops and pay a fine to the government for beingtoo productiveThe Supreme Court interpreting the Constitutions commerce clausedecided that Filburns wheat growing activities reduced the amount ofwheat he would buy for chicken feed on the open market and affectedinterstate commerce and thus could be regulated by the FederalGovernment However that Supreme Court decision agree with it or notstill does not expand thepowers of this body under the commerce clause to impose a monetary fineor penalty upon a citizen who fails to purchase or enter into a privatecontract for health insurance That doesnt expand our authority underthe commerce clause It doesnt change the commerce clause For us torequire somebody to do something simply as a status of citizenship theCongressional Research Service saysDespite the breadth of powers exercised under the CommerceClause it is unclear whether the clause would provide asolid constitutional foundation for legislation containing arequirement to have health insurance Whether such arequirement would be constitutional under the Commerce Clauseis perhaps the most challenging question posed by such aproposal as it is a novel issue whether Congress may usethis clause to require an individual to purchase a good or aserviceTo think that the Federal Government can compel any individual topurchase a commodity because that individual is alive and breathing isunconstitutional and is at least a novel issue that this 25 trillionproposal is built around Should we be doing this major change inhealth care 25 trillion in spending 12 trillion in reduction inMedicare 12 trillion raising in taxes off of a novel constitutionalquestion involved in the inherent piece of it that being therequirement for everybody to have health insurance I think not Alongwith all the other problems with it I think it has an enormousconstitutional question right in the middle of it And what if you pullthat out and the Supreme Court says ultimately you cant requirethat Then you have done 25 trillion 12 trillion in Medicarecuts 12 trillion in tax increases and your core piece is pulledout it is unconstitutional Then the whole house of cards falls apartAnother popular argument for forcing citizens to purchase healthinsurance under penalty of law is that States require people to buy carinsurance This argument is not only constitutionally flawed but alsoan underwhelming argument that in many respects hardly deserves commentand adds little to the debate It is recognized that States maintaininherent police powers to regulate behavior and enforce order withintheir borders to promote public welfare security health and safetyThis is a fundamental difference between the power of States and theenumerated powers of the national government such as commerce betweenStates and Indian tribes This is a much broader granting ofjurisdiction to the StatesState vehicle insurance laws are exactly that laws implemented byStates and are generally derived from State constitutions and not theFederal Constitution under which this body operates Furthermore theselaws require an individual who voluntarily participates in the use ofan automobile to insure that vehicle It is not a right of citizenshipas a Kansan that you have to buy auto insurance But if you want tooperate a car on our roads you have to have auto insurance It isnt arequirement of citizenshipWe are requiring this as an article of citizenship You have to havehealth insurance a novel and enormously expansive role of the FederalGovernmentThe Federal mandate for the purchase of health insurance forcesindividuals to purchase a commodity not because they choose toparticipate in an economic or commercial activity such as what onewould think would be covered under the commerce clause but forces anindividual to purchase a product simply because that person existsThis mandate is an abuse of the power granted to this Congress by theConstitutionLast night I spent some time developing another thought that I thinkis an important one for us to consider It is one this body has spentsome time over the last decade dealing with that is the removal ofthe marriage penalty from our Tax Code which we havent gotten veryfar in doing but getting the marriage penalty out the thought beingthat marriage is a good institution It is a fabulous institution forthe formation of family It is something that has an enormous role inour culture and society and should be rewarded and should not be taxedThe fundamental principle exists if you want less of something taxit if you want more of something subsidize it In the Democratichealth care bill there are marriage penalties on both lowincome andupper income individuals that will reduce the incidence of marriage inthis society under the principle that if you are going to taxsomething you will get less of itThis bill has marriage penalty taxes in it I want to go through aseries of these starting with the high cost plan tax the Cadillacinsurance plan Married couples under this bill are hit hardest by thehigh cost plans tax The number of single and married tax filers isequal but married taxpayers pay more than twice as much as singles asa percent of new tax revenue in this billSo if you are married filing jointly you will pay 62 percentsinglefilers 25 percentin this bill Is that something we want to do Dowe want to say if you are married you will pay more of the tax Mostpeople would say We want to encourage marriage and the formation offamily around marriage We should have these at least equal or maybe doa higher tax on the other end But most would say lets have these beequalInstead in this we have a huge increase in the amount of moneymarried filers will have to pay as compared to taxes paid by singlefilers Consequently you encourage people to say Lets not getmarried because we dont want to pay the increase in taxesThe high cost plans tax the Cadillac plans tax will hit marriedcouples households far more severely than single filers Even thoughthe number of married filers and single filers is roughly equal thehigh cost plans tax will impact the total tax bill of married couplesmuch more severely 25 percent of the revenue will be from singlefilers 62 percent of the bill will go to married filers One thing iscertain 62 percent of married couples households dont make more than250000 So not only is this unfair to married households it is adirect contradiction of the Presidents promise that you wouldnt paymore taxes if you were making below 250000 In this case you do underthe Cadillac insurance plan proposal or piece in this proposalI want to look at another chart on this subject If we wanted to talkabout factors that impact an individuals decision to enter theworkforce or to invest in a business an important factor is themarginal tax rate they will face on the next dollar they earnBasically it is a question of whether it is worth the effort and riskto work What is my marginal tax If I work longer and make another100 how much do I get to keep The marginal tax rateThis is an especially important factor for lowincome householdspeople who dont have much marginal income to work off of They needevery dollar they can get So if you are going to tax their marginalrate they are looking at this saying I dont want to get in thatcategory I need to hold back from getting in that categoryWe have tried to help the less economically fortunate with varioustypes of support programs TANF food stamps the earnedincome taxcredit the additional child tax credit to name a few Lowincomefamilies already face high marginal tax rates as a result of thephaseout of their benefits and tax rates that mean the loss of benefitsthey get under TANF food stamps the earnedincome tax credit housingassistance the welfare package we put together for lowincomeindividuals Lowincome families already face high marginal tax ratesas a result of the phaseout of their benefits These phaseouts alreadyimpose significant barriers to marriageIn other words whenever you get a combined income of a lowincomecouple you lose more benefits Consequently people dont get marriedbecause they look and say I will lose my health benefits if I getmarried I will lose my medical benefits my housing benefits I maylose food stamps I will not get marriedYet you look at the chances for children in that situation to get outof poverty their best chance is to have a stable mom and dad and astable marriage environment providing for the comfort and support ofthose children Our incentives are disincentives toward marriage inthis way and they are built even more significantly into this healthcare billAs an example lets take two individuals at 150 percent of thepoverty level After the new subsidies proposedin this legislation are taken into account these two individuals wouldpay 1478 for their health insurance But if they get married theirbill will increase to 2308 a marriage penalty of 830 if you are atthe 150 percent of poverty level or below If you are at 150 percent ofpoverty or below you dont have marginal income to mess around withYou need everything you have just to provide the basics So if you arelooking at this increase in the marriage penalty of 830 you aresaying We cant afford to get marriedIs that the signal we want to send from the Federal Government NoEverybody in this body would say thatLets take a pair of individuals earning 250 percent of the povertylevel One has no children the other has two children Unmarried theywill after subsidies pay 5865 for their health coverage If theydecide to marry they will face a penalty of 2050Lets turn to the new Medicare tax that will go into effect in 2013The tax will apply to wage and salary income as well as certainbusiness income for individuals The tax will apply to income of thattype for above 200000 for individuals and 250000 for joint filersThe penalty is obvious on its face Lets take an example Twounmarried individuals earn 200000 each and their total Medicaretaxes would be 11600 But if they get married the penalty is 750Or take two individuals one making 150000 and the other 200000Single their Medicare taxes total 10150 if they get married theywill pay an additional 500 This is on top of the marriage penaltiesthat two earners face under current law The marriage penalty is thereI dont think it is as significant as for the lowincome individualsbut it is here as wellMy point is why on Earth would that even be built into the base ofthe bill particularly on the lowincome couples Why on Earth wouldyou build in a marriage penalty on people who cant afford it Ifcombined income is over 250000 you can afford another 500 I amwilling to agree with that But not this couple that is making at 150percent of poverty or 250 percent of poverty one with two kids Theycant afford that Why on Earth would you build it into this This isridiculous that it be placed in the proposal It makes no senseCreating and expanding on the penalties for marriage makes zerosense Families are a critical determinant of the wellbeing of oursociety Family structure also has a significant impact on economicwellbeing on education and the effect on the social fabric of thisNation is positiveIt is a fundamental law of economics that when you tax something youget less of it Why would we tax marriage particularly for lowincomeindividuals when it is the best chance for those children involvedwith this couple to have a stable environment if they will form asolid marriage unit And we are going to tax it and discourage it Thatis wrong That is wrong as a policy matterThere is a number of other problems I have had with this overallbill This piece of it absolutely makes no sense to me why we would dosomething like this I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill totake these sorts of things out to take them out of the base lawUnfortunately in the United States today this is kind of repeatingwhat already takes place in food stamps what takes place in healthbenefits for lowincome individuals right now They cannot afford toget married or they lose their benefits It is ridiculous We ought togive people bonuses for getting married not penalties for gettingmarried Now we are going to add to it by putting it in this healthinsurance bill It is wrong and it is bad policyMr President I yield the floor
S_WA_MURRAY,2009-12-17, President I come to the floor on behalf of over10000 constituents from my home State of Washington who have sent meletters and emails over the past 6 months to tell me their stories andtheir struggles with our health care systemI come to the floor on behalf of the thousands who do not have thetime or who do not have the resources to write to me and ask for helpbut who are struggling as wellI come to the floor on behalf of small business owners parentssenior citizens and people with preexisting conditions people withinsurance whose premiums are skyrocketing and people without insurancewho spend their nights praying they do not have an accident or fallillThese people are all worried about keeping their jobs or making amortgage payment and for whom the cost of getting sick today or beingdropped from their health care plan or opening their mail to seeanother premium increase is too much to bear Those are the people whodeserve a real debate and a real plan not distortions or sillydistractions such as conversations about how many pages are in thishealth care bill What is more important than the number of pages inthis health care bill is the help within those pages for businesses andfamilies across this countryI have watched day after day as our colleagues on the other side ofthe aisle have come down to this floor They have made outrageousclaims They have handed out reams of paper and stacked copies of theSenate bill on top of copies of the House bill to try and turn aserious debate into a sideshow But if my colleagues on the other sidewant to focus on pages fine lets focus on pagesBeside me is a photo of a woman named Doreen Kelsey In front ofDoreen is a stack of papers Those are hundreds upon hundreds of pagesof forms and rejection letters and appeals and denials from herinsurance company These are pages that have taken hours and hours tofill out and that have stood between Doreens husband and the care hedesperately neededI met Doreen at a roundtable I hosted in August in Spokane WA in myState Doreen told me she is selfemployed and isnt able to purchaseher own health insurance because she has a preexisting condition Nowluckily she and her family have health insurance coverage through herhusband Tonys employer She told me she and Tony thought their familyhad good insurance coverage But when he asked for a colonoscopy theysoon discovered the lengths to which insurance companies will go todeny to delay and to dispute the care families such as the Kelseysassumed were included in their coverageTheir insurance carrier told them before they would pay for thispreventive care it would have to be approved by a primary carephysician After being delayed for more than a month because ofthat requirementand this whole stack of papers herethe colonoscopyultimately confirmed their fears and he was diagnosed with stage 4colon cancer With that diagnosis in hand the Kelseys were determinedto beat this terrible disease together but rather than focusing onfighting cancer they were forced to fight their insurance companyDoreen told me although they had faithfully paid their premiumsthroughout their entire working lives now that Tony desperately neededlifesaving treatment he was in a constant struggle of paperwork withhis insurance company to pay for even routine care They werent askingfor anything new they werent asking for anything experimental theywere just asking for the care that a lifetime of paid premiums shouldhave entitled them toThe Kelseys assumed what most Americans do when they are paying forgood health insurance They assumed that while their insurance wasexpensive it would be there for them when they needed it Well Doreenand her family like many other American families and businesses havecome to find out that in our current health care insurance systemstability is sometimes nothing more than an illusionWith each procedure and each battle the Kelseys faced a new fightmore paperwork stacked on more paperwork another appeal and anotherappeal At one point Doreen told me she had to appeal all the way tothe State insurance regulator just to get a corrected explanation ofbenefits formpaperworkfrom her insurance company She told me theyhad to borrow thousands of dollars to pay doctors while their claimswere tied up in what seemed like an endless appeal processpaperworkThe Kelseys insurance now costs more than their mortgage and theyare constantly worried that Tonys employer will drop that coverageBut thankfully she told me Tony is working hard and successfullybattling his cancer In the meantime Doreen has successfully beenbattling her insurance company But this isnt how our system shouldwork When we pass the Senates health care reform bill we aredebating it will not beLet me tell everyoneand the Kelseyshow our bill will help themFirst of all our bill ends insurance company discrimination forpreexisting conditions so Doreen will be able to purchase insurance onher own and not have to rely on her husbands employer Doreen wouldalso have access to a number of different plans through an exchangethat we are setting up where insurance companies for the first timewould have to compete for her business Our plan would injectcompetition into the insurance market and we know that will lowercosts and give families such as Doreens more choicesOur plan also makes it illegal for insurance companies to drop peoplewhen they get sick so Doreen and Tony wouldnt have to worry aboutlosing their coverage at the moment they need it the most Since weknow that preventive care is critical to saving lives and saving moneyon health care costs in the long term our bill ensures free preventiveservices under all insurance plansOur plan invests in prevention and in public health to encourageinnovations in health care that prevent illness and disease before theyrequire more costly treatment It would have allowed Tony to get acolonoscopy when he first needed it so he could get his treatmentstarted soonerMr President we also know families deserve the security andstability of knowing that if they or their loved one do get sick theywill not be forced into bankruptcy to pay for the cost Our billrestricts the arbitrary limits that insurance companies currently placeon the amount of coverage families receive It caps the total amountthat insurance companies can make people pay out of pocket on copaysand deductibles And it eliminates the lifetime limits insurancecompanies can impose on coverageIn addition to putting in place those important consumer protectionsthat would help people such as Doreen and Tony it will give familiesthe stability and security they deserve and lower the cost of care soAmericans such as Tony and Doreen would not have coverage that costs asmuch or more than their mortgage We do that by putting in placepremium rate reviews to track increases and crack down on excessiveinsurance company overhead costsWhen our bill passesand I am confident it will despite the delayand the delay and the delay that we are seeing on the other side of theaisleinsurance companies will no longer be able to hike up Doreenspremiums to pay for a bureaucracy they will then put to work battlingher claimsWe also provide sliding scale premium tax creditstax creditsforfamilies who still cant afford coverage which would help 450000people in my home State of Washington get the coverage they needMr President the bill before us todaywhich some of my colleagueshave sitting on their desks and they bring out here on a daily basis toshow us the pageswill help families such as the Kelseys That is whatis within the pages of the bill they keep throwing at us So I thinkrather than talking about the number of pages in the bill ourcolleagues on the other side of the aisle might actually want to talkabout what is in the bill because right now instead of debating themerits of bringing down costs or protecting families from losing thecoverage when they get sick our colleagues are actually spending timecomplaining this bill has too many pagesI ask the Presiding Officer and my colleagues on the other side ofthe aisle to take a look at this photo of Doreen sitting next tohundreds and hundreds of pages of correspondence and appeals and fightswith her insurance company These are the pages we ought to be talkingabout These are the pages that impact peoples lives and the Kelseysare the people we ought to be talking aboutSo when my colleagues come down here and complain about the number ofpages in our health reform billthose pages that will help ourfamilies and businesses lower costsI want them to think about thenumber of pages right here in front of Doreen These are pages thathave caused the Kelseys unimaginable heartache and these are the pagesthat have come between them and the health care they paid forThese are the numbers we ought to be focusing onthe 14000 peoplewho are losing coverage every day These are the numbers we ought to befocusing onthe 51 million people who have no insurance Those are thenumbers we ought to be focusing on not the number of pages in thebillMr President we have to end the politics end the delay and thepartisanship We need to end this obstruction because that is what theKelseys faced every day delay and obstruction They are facing itagain on the floor of the Senate It is time for us to come together onthis important bill and bring our businesses and our families theinsurance reform they have been asking for I hope that is whatAmericans will remember at the end of the day that the pages in thisbill are going to change their lives so they dont have to fight theirinsurance companies againMr President we are here today in the Senatenobody on the floorjust me talking about what we ought to be doing and you in the Chairwaiting Why Because we have a Defense appropriations bill in front ofthe Senate It is a Defense appropriations bill that needs to be passedby the end of this year It needs to be passed so we can get back onthe floor and pass our health care reform billSome people on the other side of the aisle have decided that delayingthis Defense bill will somehow help them delay this from ever beingpassedthe health care bill that would help Doreen and her familyWell Mr President it isnt just about making a political point Whatwe are doing is having our soldierswho are serving on the ground inIraq in Afghanistan around the globe and here in our countrywonderwhat they are going to get for Christmasa delay from the SenateThe bill in front of us provides a 34percent military pay increaseThis is an AllVolunteer Force we have out there working for us Manyof them are away from their families this Christmas They do not wantto hear that the Senate is delaying passing this important bill thatwill give them the security they need because of political obstructionin order to delay a health care billThis Defense bill is critically important It has very importantsupport for our military and their families It has passed through thisSenate before and we are ready now to make the final trip to the WhiteHouse which needs to be done by the way by tomorrow So I hope ourcolleagues will not continue to delay I hope they will allow us tomove to final passage on this bill so our men and women who are servingus in the military and around the globe know there is a Senate who isworking for themI have heard some of them on the other side complain that some thingswere added to the Senate Defense billthat also need to be done by theend of the year besides the Defense billsuch as making sure ourfamilies whose benefits are running out for unemployment or COBRA forhealth care insurance get a 2month extension So should our Christmaspresent to them be Sorry you arent going to get your small littlehelp as we end this year We want to keep that going for another 3months during one of the worst economic times we have seen So ofcourse we put it in this billBecause of the obstruction on the other side we cant get it throughin a timely fashion It has to be done by the end of this year We aredoing the right thing for our families We are doing the right thingfor our military by putting it in this bill and getting it done and tothe President so we can finish our workMr President these are all critical issues We are all tired Wehave been here day after day after day It is time to get this doneLet me tell you why Because Doreen and her husband are facing pilesand piles of paperwork to care for her husband They are fighting theirinsurance company And all we have to do is put these bills in front ofus get them done and provide some relief for America I hope that iswhat we focus on Mr President I hope we stop the deny and delay andobstruction that the Kelseys have had to fight with their insurancecompany Lets move these bills and go home to our families forChristmasMr President I yield the floorThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Udall of New Mexico The Senator fromIllinois is recognized
H_TX_BARTON,2009-12-08, And we believe that the Atlantic and Pacific arein a cooling period  Something called a PSO and an AMO or something  I would now like to yield to one of the mostinformed Congressmen on the issue of climate change the Honorable JohnLinder of the great State of Georgia  Im told this you probably know that there aremore glaciers in the world that are growing than there are that are indecline  I know its dangerous for Congressmen toactuallythink We are not accused of doing that very often but there aresometimes some Congressmen you and I I think are two not thatothers dont but we actually thinkNow I want to build on what you just said These ice core samplesthat you got the data that show temperature goes up and thenCOINF2INF goes up And if temperature were to go down thenCOINF2INF would go down  That means that temperature is the dominantvariable and that it drives the dependent variable which isCOINF2INF Temperature goes up and then COINF2INF goes up   So Vice President Gore is only off by 180degrees  We are in a situation right now where itappears it depends on the data that you believe but if the datapoints that we think are correct are correct we are in a coolingperiod Temperature has gone down at least 8 years in a row andprobably 12 years in a row and we appear to be in a cooling periodBut at the same time we have to admit that COINF2INFconcentrations are going up   So I would hypothesize that the COINF2INFconcentrations going up are going to prevent as much cooling and itwill keep the planet warmer than it would be otherwise but stillcooler overall which would be a good thing for mankind We dont wantanother ice age do we  Markey before you yield back could youanswer a question if you still have time We have a fundamental difference on the datawhich is part of what our Special Order is going to be We haveverifiable data that the temperature has gone down the last 11 years ina row and yet you alluded to some data points about the hottest yearson record and stuff I mean how do we reconcile that We cant saythe temperature has gone down 11 years in a row and you have data thatsays 2005 was the second hottest year on record and all of that Imean how do we reconcile these data points I mean is there a way amethodology that we can supply our data and you can supply your dataand we can try to reconcile them I mean the facts ought to be thefacts We can have different opinions but we ought to agree on whatthe facts are Are those data points public Well one of the things that I hope we canagree we can have different opinions different views on issues butbetween you as chairman of the Climate Committee and Mr Waxman aschairman of the Energy Committee and Mr Sensenbrenner who is yourranking member and myself who is the ranking member on Energy weshould be able to get a data set that we both agree is what the factsare and I would like your cooperation in doing thatOur data sets that Im going to allude to are different Now I knowenough to know what I dont know And I dont know if thats a surfacetemperature I dont know if thats a tropospheric temperature in theupper atmosphere I dont know if thats a local temperature thatssome sort of an annual mean There are all kinds of different ways todescribe it and to calculate it but we ought to agree as policyleaders on a way to get a data set that everybody says then we aregoing to debate the implications of that data set whatever it is AndI hope that you and Mr Waxman We are going to introduce in our Special Ordersome serious concerns that some of the scientists that maintain thesedata sets manipulate change and eliminate for their own conclusionsAnd again its very fair to have an opinion and have a scientificdebate but it shouldnt be fair to manipulate the data in a way thatat best is disingenuous or in some cases deceitful and I hope youwould agree with that I encourage you to listen and if you wish tostay and maybe participate in our Special Order you would be welcome  Madam Speaker I do think that I will use the 1hour I understand theres going to be a rule reported in the time andwell certainly yield to the person from the Rules Committee to filethat ruleMadam Speaker I wish to rise to discuss a topic thats already beendiscussed on the House floor this evening Its the issue of climatechange or global warming Next week I am honored to be one of thecongressional delegation attending the Copenhagen Climate ChangeConference in Copenhagen Denmark thats going to be led by ouresteemed Speaker the Honorable Nancy Pelosi I also attended KyotoBuenos Aires and The Hague Im the ranking Republican on the Energyand Commerce Committee and formerly also on the Science Committee andI have been a participant at the congressional level on the climatechange debate for the last 20 yearsIm going to start off by putting into the Record a suppressed reportthat Congressman Poe just talked about that has never before thisevening been made public in its entire unexpurgated form The title ofthe report is Comments on the Draft Technical Support Document for theEndangerment Analysis for Greenhouse Gas Emissions under the Clean AirAct This report was compiled by Dr Alan Carlin who is a careerscientist and investigator at the EPA At one time he selfdescribedhimself Im told as a global warming believer He prepared thisreport He works in a group within the EPA that is responsible forconducting an internal review of some of these draft orders before theygo public And Im not going to read the entire report Im going toread excerpts of the preface and the executive summary and then I willput the entire report into the RecordThis is from the executive summary and the preface and I quote Wehave become increasingly concerned that EPA has itself paid too littleattention to the science of global warming EPA and others have tendedto accept the findings reached by outside groups particularly theIPCC which is the International Protocol on Climate Change under theauspices of the United Nations and the CCSP as being correctwithout a careful and critical examination of their conclusions anddocumentation If theyshould be found to be incorrect at a later date however the EPA isfound not to have made a really careful independent review of thembefore reaching its decision on endangerment it appears likely that itis the EPA rather than these other groups that may be blamed for anyerrorsFurther down on the executive summary Page 1 Our conclusions dorepresent the best science in the sense of most closely correspondingto available observations that we currently know of however and aresufficiently at variance with those of the IPCC CCSP and the DraftTSD that we believe they support our increasing concern that the EPAhas not critically reviewed the findings by these groupsFurther we believe our concerns and reservations are sufficientlyimportant to warrant a serious review of the science by EPA before anyattempt is made to reach conclusions on the subject of endangermentfrom greenhouse gasesAnd on Page 2 What is actually noteworthy    is not therelative apparent scientific shine of the two sidesthose thatoppose and those that support the global warming argumentbut ratherthe relative ease with which major holes have been found in thegreenhouse gasCOINF2INFglobal warming argument In many casesthe most important arguments are based not on multimillion dollarresearch efforts but by simple observation of available data whichhas surprisingly received little scrutiny The best example of this isthe MSU satellite data on global temperatures Simple scrutiny of thisdata yields what to us are stunning observations Yet this has receivedsurprisingly little study or at least publicity In the end it must beemphasized that the issue is not which side has spent the most money orpublished the most peerreviewed papers or been supported by morescientific organizations This is very important the next sentenceThe issue is whether the greenhouse gasCOINF2INFAGW hypothesismeets the ultimate scientific testconformance with real world dataWhat these comments show is that it is this ultimate test that thehypothesis fails That the hypothesis fails This is why EPA needsto carefully reexamine the science behind global warming beforeproposing an endangerment findingNow this is from Dr Carlin in the EPA This is not some disgruntledRepublican Congressman This is a professional scientist PhD in anoffice within the EPA that is tasked with reviewing this endangermentdocument before a final decision is made And in his words theultimate test is whether the greenhouse gas COINF2INF hypothesismeets the ultimate scientific test conformance with real world dataThese comments show that it is the ultimate test that the hypothesisfailsFurther on Page 3 of the executive summary there are severalprincipal comments that they wish to raise in their review As of thebest information we currently haveand this was in March of 2009the greenhouse gasCOINF2INF hypothesis as the cause of globalwarming which the Draft TSD supports is currently an invalidhypothesis from a scientific viewpoint because it fails a number ofcritical comparisons with available observable data Any one of thesefailings should be enough to invalidate the hypothesis the breadth ofthese failings leaves no other possible conclusion based on currentdata As Feynman said in 1975 failure to conform to real worlddata makes it necessary from a scientific viewpoint to revise thehypothesis or abandon it Unfortunately this has not happened in theglobal warming debate but needs to if an accurate finding concerningendangerment is to be madeThe failings listed below why we should not have an endangermentfinding in order of importance in our viewNumber 1 the lack of observed upper tropospheric heating in thetropicsNumber 2 the lack of observed constant humidity levelsNumber 3 the most reliable sets of global temperature data we haveusing satellite microwave sounding units show no appreciabletemperature increases during the critical period from 1978 to 1997Satellite data after 1998 is also inconsistent with the greenhouse gasCOINF2INFAGW hypothesisNumber 4 the models used by the IPCC do not take into account orshow the most important ocean oscillations which clearly do affectglobal temperaturesNumber 5 the models in the IPCC ignored the possibility of indirectsolar variabilityNumber 6 the models in the IPCC ignored the possibility that theremay be other significant natural effects on global temperaturesNumber 7 surface global temperature data may have been hopelesslycorrupted by the urban heat island effectNow this one is the one that I was asking Mr Markey about to seewhere he got his data set because surface global temperature if youtake it in downtown Manhattan for example is going to be verydifferent than if you take a surface temperature in a rural area Theactual urban effect the concrete the asphalt the buildings raise thetemperature and there is some concern that this urban heat islandeffect has corrupted the temperatureThose are just seven reasons in this draft document why this authorhad skepticism about going forward with an endangerment finding Andyet this report was not made a part of the record This report was notmade public In fact this report was suppressed and because ofconsiderable anxiety on the part of people like myself and CongressmanIssa Congressman Sensenbrenner the author was allowed to put aredacted version of this report on his personal Web site Then we wereable to get the unredacted version provided to us by the EPA andthats the version that Im going to put in the RecordAs this author says Dr Carlin he was prophetic because were nowseeing that some of the climatologistsmaybe more than somehaveattempted to suppress certain data to destroy data sets to manipulatedata sets to not get a true scientific review but to reach apreconceived conclusionMadam Speaker I think that is wrong I will yield to the distinguished member of theRules Committee I thank the gentleman for bringing that to ourattention and it sounds like a worthy proposal I would like to yield such time as he mayconsume to a member of the committee from the great State of IllinoisMr ShimkusMr SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend hisremarks  When was that email Was that 10 years ago Wasthat a decade ago When was that   Phil Jones he is the head of theClimate Research Unit at East Anglia University in Great Britain Is hethe gentleman that just resigned  And is Michael Mann the professor at Penn Statethat is the proponent initially of the hockey stick theory which hasbeen shown to be discredited and was actually using data sets that weremanipulated in a way that they shouldnt have done Those are the twogentleman the author and the recipients of this email  And are these two gentlemen two of the leadingproponents in the IPCC that climate is growing warmer because ofmanmade COINF2INF emissions  Now my assumption and this is an assumption isthat the gentleman that wrote those emails and that received them byand large are in the inner circle of the climate change community andin all probability they are in Copenhagen right now  And if the President were to commit the UnitedStates to a legislative path that these scientists support and if wewere to adopt as law the climate change bill that passed the House thatrequires a reduction of 83 percent of emissions from COINF2INFmanmade sources 2005 by the year 2050 and we implemented that wewould have a COINF2INF emissions level in this country that welast experienced in 1910 And if we do it on a per capita basis that welast experienced per person in 1875 is it the gentlemans positionthat if we were to do that our lifestyle in the year 2050 would beanywhere comparable to where it is today   If it were the floor of the House would be atoxic waste dump because there is more COINF2INF created here thanin any other size room in the country with the exception of perhapsthe Senate floor  But it would have been a little warmer than itis today We might not have been comfortable wearing a woolen sweaterback then  All I know is when people retire they move toFlorida and Texas  One of whom just resigned from his position inEast Anglia  It would be similar if we held an election andif we just said Assume that I won  But we didnt release the documents and wedidnt release the ballots and we didnt let them be audited and wedidnt have a canvassing committee  We just said Well assume that sinceCongressman Linder says he won he did win   Well they should be in the public domainanyway We want to now turn to the Congressman from New Orleans Louisiana amember of the Energy and Commerce Committee Congressman Scalise  The AR4 data set is the data set that was usedin the IPCC report in 2007 so its a seminal document that has beenused for policymaking decisions not just in the United States but allover the world  What you are saying is they went to some lengthsto manipulate the data that that report is based on  May I ask the Chair how much time we haveremaining in our Special OrderAt about 10 minutes to go I have got some documents I want to put inthe Record  I want to thank Congressman Scalise CongressmanLinder and Congressman Shimkus for participating in this SpecialOrderWhat we are attempting to do is to actually use the scientific methodto determine what steps if any the United States Government shouldtake policywise if in fact climate change or global warming is amajor problem that needs to be addressed It does appear in myopinion that there is reasonable doubt about whether we shouldtake some of the radical steps that have been espoused in the climatechange bills which have passed the House and which are pending in theSenateI want to take the remaining time and go through a series of emailsthat have just become publicweve alluded to themand go into alittle more depthThe first email which we have already alluded to is from MichaelMann Michael Mann is a climatologist at Penn State University He isone of the leading scientists in the IPCC He is the author of theoriginal hockey stick theory that is kind of the genesis the seminaldocument for the theory that manmade COINF2INF is the cause ofthe climate warming in the world This is a document from him to PhilJones who was until recently the head of the Climate Research Unitat East Anglia University in Great BritainNow Dr Jones resigned in the last week or so but in it he saysCan you delete any emails that youve have had with KeithKeith isKeith Briffaregarding AR4AR4 is a UN IPCC fourth assessment document from 2007 Its one ofthese policy documents that is used around the worldYou can see that he says I am going to contact Gene about thisOkay Gene is actually Eugene Wahl He is at the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administrations office in Boulder Colorado Thats withthe US Department of CommerceHe said I am going to contact Gene about this Can you delete anyemails that you have Ill get Caspar to do likewiseCaspar is Caspar JonesI mean Caspar Ammann He is at the NationalCenter for Atmospheric Research or NCAR in Boulder Colorado Its afederally supported consortiumSo in this email we have collaboration between NOAA NCARboth inthe United Statesthe Climate Research Unit which is CRU in EastAnglia Great Britain and many prominent IPCC contributorscoordinating document destruction I think that is something thatpolicymakers here in the United States should be concerned aboutNow lets go to the next document email No 2 Now the first onewas from Michael Mann to Phil Jones This is from Phil Jones to agentleman named Tom Wigley Its subject is Schles suggestion This islast year December of 2008 It says I am supposed to go through myemails and he can get anything Ive written about him About 2 monthsago I deleted loads of emails so we have very little if anything atallSo what this is showing is or one could say they have conspired todelete data This is of Ben Santer who is Santer 1 who is a prominentclimate modeler at the Department of Energys Lawrence LivermoreNational Laboratory and of Tom Wigley who is a scientist at theNational Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder ColoradoThe gist of this is he has already deleted a lot of emails from 2months ago What are they trying to hide hereNow lets go to email number 3 Email number 3 shows anunprecedented data purge at the CRU in East Anglia Great Britain Hereis a public index of documents on one day and then here is the publicindex on the next very quickly after they have gone through andpurged all purged all of this It says the next day on July 28 PhilJones deleted data from his public files leaving online a variety offiles from the 1990s This morning everything in Dr Phils directoryhad been removedIts not just the emails that have been deleted in a widely reportedevent Steve MCIntyre who is a Canadian researcher who testifiedbefore Congress several years ago when I was chairman and who has beenattempting to get these data sets to get these documents he has beentrying to get through the Freedom of Information Act the publicdocuments that some of these studies are purported to be based uponInstead of releasing them they purged them They took them away inwhat is reported to be an unprecedented data purgeThey have deleted files pertaining to station data from the publicdirectories Why Where are the data now if they are still inexistence What is it they are trying to hide If the temperature datarecords really proved their theory they would want to publicize themAt least I would think that they wouldLets go to number 4 This is an email from Phil Jones who we knowwell now to a gentleman named Neville Nicholls Mr Nicholls letssee Mr Nicholls I am not sure who Mr Nicholls is but here it saysI hope I dont get a call from Congress I am hoping that no one thererealizes I have a US Department of Energy grant and have had thiswith Tom W for the past 25 yearsThis is back in 2005 This is when I was chairman of the Energy andCommerce Committee and we were conducting the investigation into DrManns hockey stick proposal hockey stick theory and we had asked forsome documents from Professor Mann or Dr Mann and this gentleman issaying we hope the Congress doesnt realize that we are getting Federalmoney we dont want them to be asking us about documentsOf course as we now know they have destroyed many of thosedocuments or apparently have destroyed many of those documentsLets go to number 5 Now this documents shows the lengths to whichthey will go to suppress information says if they ever hear that thereis a Freedom of Information Act now in the UK I think I will deletethese rather than send them to anyoneNow Congressman Markey who is a good friend of mine and who is abeliever a proponent of manmade global warming has got data sets thathe says justify some of the policies that he supports But here we seethat some of these documents and some of these data sets that MrMarkey and others havewho sincerely believe that there is a problemappear to be very suspect In fact they are so suspect that if theyhave to release them publicly they would rather delete them than tocomply with the Freedom of Information ActTom Wigley had sent me a worried email when he heard about it Hethought that people might ask him for his model code My heavens youknow Keep in mind that this theory that mankindmade COINF2INFemissions is driving the temperature upwards its just that its atheory These researchers have built these models to try to replicatethe planets temperature mechanism and all these models show thetemperature going upBut thats the conclusion that the modelers want It is not factuallycorrect to say the temperature is going up its factually correct tosay the modelers who want to prove that the temperature is going upare putting variables and assumptions in these models that drive themup but they apparently dont have the data to back that upLets go to number 6 This is again from Mr Jones a gentleman namedGavin Schmidt concerning the revised version of something called theWengen paper Wengen It says all of our Freedom of Informationofficers have been in discussions and are now using the same exceptionsnot to respondthe advice that they got from the informationcommissioner The Freedom of Information line that we are using is thatthe IPCCnow keep in mind the IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Changeis funded primarily by the US taxpayer notexclusively but primarily is exempt from any countrys Freedom ofInformation because the skeptics have been told this Even though wepossibly hold relevant information that the IPCC is not part of ourremit ie mission statement therefore we dont have an obligationto pass it onTo me thats just irresponsible to say that the IPCC which is atotal governmental agency admittedly through the UN and a largenumber of nations but the US as the primary funder is above FederalFreedom of Information laws not only in the United States but in everyother country This information that has been collected and paid for byUS taxpayers and funded by US scientists is now out of reach of theUS taxpayer I think thats just flat wrong Madam SpeakerMy last email is number 7 and this shows while they accuse peoplelike myself of trying to be bullies and to ostracize people here is anemail whereagain this Professor Mann Michael its to Michael Mann from agentleman named Malcolm Hughes just a heads up apparently thecontrarians now have an in with GRLGRL which is the Geophysical Research Letters a prominent climatejournalthis guy Sayers has a prior connection with the University ofVirginia Department of Environmental Sciences that causes me someunease Then later onthis is truly awful If you think that Sayers isin the greenhouse skeptics camp then if we can find documentaryevidence of this we could go through official ATU channels to get himousted They are trying to ostracize those that are honest enough tosay that they have some doubts about the theoryI will end with this The theory of global warming caused by mankindis just that it is a theory it is not a fact As US taxpayers andas the guardians of the US taxpayers we should demand that the factsbe made public so that we can make a relevant policy decision
H_GA_LINDER,2009-12-08,  Andwe have now 3400 instruments that go into the oceans And every 10days they pop up and they give satellites information of what is onthose instruments about the temperatures And there has been no warmingin the oceans  In the last 2 million years we have had20 ice ages 20 glaciations the last on average about 100000 yearsinterrupted by about 10000 years of warming It has been 11400 yearssince the last glaciation It is likely the planet is looking towardgoing cooler again We have had less sun activity in the last 11 yearsthan weve had in many many years  I first got interested in this 5 or 6 years ago on a trip to NewZealand It was a congressional delegation We had a visit with theleader of the NOAA point there where they leave to go into Antarcticafor their expeditions and come back to this scientific center And theyput a PowerPoint presentation together for us and a big chart on thewall that showed that at that time they had dug into the Vostok icecore for 400000 years back and that from 400000 years back to todaytemperature increases and decreases and COINF2INF increases anddecrease were in consonance They moved with each otherAnd I asked him Who was burning fossil fuels 400000 years ago Hetook that as a rude question and it took me a year to get a copy ofthat chart But I studied that chart And then I looked at the studiesabout the Vostok ice core And what you discover when you dont have iton a 812by11 piece of paper and expanded is that temperaturechanges precede COINF2INF changes by about 1000 years  One study says 800 years one study says2800 years but people average it at about 1000 years   We are prepared to have that debate right now if thegentleman would yield COINF2INF is a trace gas It is a plant food It is beneficial toall of life COINF2INF is a modest gas Methane is 23 times morepowerful at trapping heat Sixtyfive percent of the heattrappinggases come from water vaporWe are not going after them because we are going after people Whatyou learn when you discover that COINF2INF levels follow thetemperature changes is that theres a reason for it And the reason isthis we go through ice ages and global increases and declines intemperature And as the temperature declines globally the trees at thetop of the mountain start to die for lack of photosynthesis and thenthe bushes and then the grasslands And the dust that blows in thewinds that are always here blows out across the oceans And part ofthat dust is lead And when that lead settles to the bottom of theoceans it catalyzes growth in the largest biological mass we have inthis planet the plankton And that growth demands COINF2INF tokeep goingNow the oceans contain 70 times as much COINF2INF as theatmosphere does And as the plant life the plankton pulls thatCOINF2INF out of the oceans homeostasis or equilibrium causesmore COINF2INF to come out of the atmosphere and into the oceansThe reverse happens when the planet warms up through more solaractivity So colder oceans hold more COINF2INF than warm oceansAnd when the planet cools off the COINF2INF winds up in theoceans and out of the atmosphere We have 388 parts per million today  Will the gentleman yield  We heard the gentleman from Massachusetts talk about BigOil and Saudi Arabia funding all of the opposition I cant find thescientists that are getting those checks But a recent study came outin the last several weeks that says that government money going toclimate science on behalf of those who believe in humancause globalwarming has been 79 billion over the last 20 years They have dwarfedanything on the other side of the issue And they continue to do itWould you suggest that maybe thats why they are continuing to hidethis situation because the money keeps coming  I believe the number this year is 7 billion from thegovernment  But 388 parts permillion is not even high Its at the low end of the comfort scaleRoughly 65 to 135 million years when the dinosaurs roamed this EarthCOINF2INF levels were five and 10 times as high they are today andproduced a tremendous amount of greenery that fed those animals542 million years ago was the Cambrian period It came to be known asthe Cambrian explosion because in a very short period of time 5 to 10million years which in a 412 billionyearold planet is the blinkof an eye in that short period of time all of multicellular complexlife that has ever existed on this Earth was deposited in the fossilevidenceHow did that happen That happened because temperatures were warmerThe COINF2INF levels were 7000 parts per million 20 times whatit is today The entire planet was covered with greenery and hadimmense amounts of oxygen and all of complex life as we know it 96percent of which is no longer existent  I alwayslike to ask people who tell me the temperature is growing too much tosay what should the current temperature be Tell me Should it be thetemperature 1000 years ago when Greenland was settled for agricultureOr when the people in Scotland were growing wine grapes Or should itbe 879 AD when the Thames froze over Or should it be a little iceage when Greenland was empty of life again   COINF2INF is a beneficial trace helpful gas thatfeeds plants And this whole notion that we should control it somehowis nothing but vanity We are not going to change what is put on thisplanet for 412 billion years Now we are told and we heard from thegentleman from Massachusetts that there is a scientific consensus Hesaid 98 percent of the scientists tens of thousands agree with hisposition Well I would like to ask him to produce that list Becauseonly 600 of them shared the Nobel Prize with Al Gore A scientist fromAustralia has said only 35 people actually wrote the IPCC reports andthey were controlled by 10 people  He did What is not popularly known is that 32000scientists including Edward Teller 9000 of whom are PhDs and therest masters have signed a statement that says there is no evidencethat humans are causing any impact on the global warming that occurredbetween 1975 and 1998 none whatsoever In fact five scientists whocontributed to the first IPCC report said in their papers there is noevidence that humans are contributing Those five statements wereremoved by the top bureaucrat at the IPCC and replaced with onestatement that said there is no doubt that humans are causing this Hewas asked about that under oath in a legal action Why did he removethose statements He said under immense pressure from the top of theFederal Government of the United StatesNow consensus doesnt mean much in science Consensus isimportant in politics In science we have to be seeking truth andfact Indeed in science only two conditions are ever obtained One istheory and the other is fact You put forth your theory You releaseyour underlying documents and sources and methods and you let yourpeers review it and try and replicate itThat is the point at which I got very nervous about this sciencebecause I tried to get underlying documents from Jim Hansen who hadthe first computer model He first testified before Congress in 1989 Ibelieve in the Senate He recently attested recently spoke inEngland He said We have 4 years to save the planet He doesntrelease his source documents because he says they are proprietaryWell he is an employee of the Federal Government The FederalGovernment ought to own those documents They ought to be releasedWhen somebody is hiding something when somebody is hiding things youbegin to wonder why he is hiding it    What we are learning from East Angliaand I want to makea point that the gentleman  I want to make a point that those are not stolendocuments Those documents were released from inside by awhistleblower But somebody working inside that organization realized they weredestroying documents that were being asked for in the Freedom ofInformation Act and someone released those documents I believe thatwe ought to be thinking about releasing everything Let scientists pourover it and establish whether the theory is actually a fact and moveon  Will the gentleman yield  Sadly that data that the IPCC uses from East Anglia isalso the basis of the data that NASA uses in Huntsville Alabama andall of the other future models that have been built have been somehowshaped by that data So there is no place to go now since all of thesource documents have been thrown away to reconstruct all of that The data that you are talking about and that we are acting on in thiscountry with capandtrade is also the data being used in Copenhagentoday as we speak to begin what Al Gore called the ultimate reasonfor all of this global governance turning over the sovereignty of theUnited States to an unelected bureaucracy and the United Nations
S_IL_BURRIS,2009-12-17, President I also would like to make a few commentson the issue that is pending before this body and which has beendebated and debated and debated discussed and discussed and discussedIt is time to bring it to a meaningful and final conclusionAs I address this Chamber today we stand on the cusp of history Formany years we have known that the American health care system is badlybroken Now after nearly a century of debate after 100 years of delayand false starts this body is on the verge of laying the issue ofhealth reform to a restThis bill represents the culmination of decades of hard work Itscourse has been shaped by 11 Presidents and countless Members of theHouse and Senate It has taken a long and winding path to reach thispoint This legislation is a product of compromise and consensus ofgive and take on both sides It is not perfect by no means is itperfect But here we standWe have come further than any Congress in history on this issue Wehave worked hard to craft a measure that can accomplish the goals ofreform without alienating those whose support we need to pass thisbill Without a commitment to certain ideals this bill would be emptyand ineffective But without a willingness to work together and achievecompromise this bill can never become a political realityAs responsible legislators this is the fine line we must alwayswalk It is never easy I applaud my colleagues for the fine work theyhave done at every step along the way Still not everyone issatisfied so the work goes on It is the genius of our FoundingFathers and the rules of this body that allow one Senator to keepdebate alive so we can work debate write rewrite legislationtogether One Senator can do that under the rules of this bodySome have suggested that we kill this legislation and start overThey suggest that we stop and come up with something new They saywithout perfection we should give up on reform altogetherI have spoken on the Senate floor Mr President You know what myposition has been But giving up on this issue is not an option So asmy colleagues and I continue to move forward from here I would like tomake one thing very clear After 100 years of debate we have come toofar and worked too hard to turn back now Too many Americans arecounting on us to make a decision on their behalf They need it nowThey dont need it tomorrow or next week or next month or next year orneverthey need it now Killing the bill would ignore those who lookto us for help in their time of crisis We cannot abandon them at thistime Leaving tens of millions of people without any health coverage atall is also unacceptableTo all those who believe we should kill this bill I would say this Iunderstand their frustration the impulse to say enough is enough Butour vote in this body on this bill is not the end of a path for thissweeping legislation only a door to the next step of conferenceI have not yet seen the details of the legislation I have not yetseen the CBO score I have not yet seen the provisions that will earnmy vote namely cost containment competition and accountability Itis only through keeping this legislation alive that we can continue ourwork to make this a more perfect document I say we must continue towork on this document we have before us We cannot kill thislegislation and start over We must keep working through thislegislation keeping it alive so we can continuecontinueto makethis document what we want it to be That is what we must doI yield the floorMr President I suggest the absence of a quorum
H_PA_DENT,2009-12-11,A recorded vote was ordered  Speaker this motion to recommit will immediately endthe Troubled Asset Relief Program otherwise known as TARP and requirethat all TARP funds that are repaid to the Treasuryincludinginterest dividends the sale value of stock and the sale of warrantsbe used to reduce our national burgeoning deficits It will also reducethe debt limit by the same amount saved by ending TARP I call thismotion to recommit the troubled taxpayer relief program act becauseit takes an important step towards getting government out of thebailout business and curbing excessive Washington spending TARP wasoriginally enacted as a temporary plan to address an extraordinarycrisis in our financial markets as a result of the collapse offinancial firms that the government said were just too big to failThose who voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act whichcreated TARP did so with the assurance that the money would bereturned to taxpayers That was the assurance given at the timeIt is unfortunate that the President chose to extend the TARP programto October 3 2010 In doing so he has opened the door to efforts byDemocrats in Congress to begin spending unallocated and repaid TARPfunds for programs unrelated to the financial emergency In fact theunderlying bill diverts 4 billion from TARP to a number of foreclosuremitigation and neighborhood stabilization programs It also diverts atotal of 23625 billion to pay for the massive expansion of governmentbureaucracy that will result from the enactment of this legislationAnd just yesterday we heard from Treasury Secretary Tim Geithnerthat the administration is developing an initiative to tackle oureconomic problems and unemployment by using TARP funds for smallbusinesses Elizabeth Warren appointed to lead the panel that overseesthe use of TARP funds responded to the Secretary saying Its notnews to anyone that small business lending is important Smallbusinesses are closing every day But Treasury has announced threeplans and has not gotten the job doneThe President has said that we need to spend our way out of thisrecession The majority already tried that in passing the 787billion stimulus It has not worked Now they want to spend more TARPmoney Havent we learned that if we want to create jobs and grow oureconomy we must support the private sector and invest Federal dollarssparingly and wiselyUnfortunately this bill not only fails to end the TARP now that theemergency in the financial markets has abated it also turns TARP intoa revolving slush fund to pay for the majoritys political economicand social agenda Failing to honor the original intent of TARP andrepay the taxpayers is an irresponsible breach of trust that we arecommitted to stoppingAmericans are struggling under the weight of high unemploymentsluggish economic growth and unsustainable Federal deficits ThisCongress has piled on with a socalled stimulus bill that borrows toomuch spends too much and delivers too few jobs and a budget thatdoubles the national debt in 5 years and triples it in 10 years Theyare piling on with a misguided national energy tax called capandtradethat will cost thousands of jobs in my State of Pennsylvania andincrease energy costs for families and businesses alike anundemocratic card check bill that will deny secret ballots and imposebinding arbitration and a controversial health care bill that imperilsinnovation raises taxes cuts Medicare and endangers jobsNow they are piling on with this 1300page bill that keeps taxpayerson the hook for permanent bailouts allows unelected bureaucrats topick winners and losers in our economy and adds an array of new jobkilling taxes and mandates on consumers investors and smallbusinessesRaiding TARP to fund more government programs that dont create jobsverges on the reckless The best way to bring about economic growth andjob creation is to avoid the massive deficits and to lessen the massiveincrease in the national debt These misguided policies advanced bythe majority are a road to higher inflation and record tax increasesToday we can begin the process of putting our fiscal house in orderand inspiring confidence in the private sector by shutting down TARPreturning the unused funds to the taxpayers and lowering the nationaldebt limitAt this time I would like to yield the balance of my time to MrHensarling of Texas
H_WI_MOORE,2009-12-15, I come from a community where there has beena great deal of discussion about the failures of students on thefourthgrade reading tests and about the failures of students on theeighthgrade math tests so I am really interested in your descriptionof how the TRIO Programs really provide an intervention as it werein admittedly a systemically failed process up through middle schoolThe TRIO Programs as I have come to understand them literallyintervene in kids lives in middle schools through the Upper Boundprogram for example and through Talent Search They really identifythat next generation of students who have the capability and thecapacity to go to college and to really keep our country on top Manycountries do this They have done it for generations They haveidentified kids in middle schools Despite the incapacity of thefamilies based on their incomes to put their kids in private schoolsor to give them tutoring the TRIO Programs intervene in middle schooland put them on a college track Here are some of the data andstatistics that I want you to respond toFirst of all in terms of lowincome studentsand Im not talkingabout any particular race or anything because as I understand it 37percent of those students enrolled in TRIO are white students 35percent are African American 19 percent are Hispanic 4 percent areNative Americans 22000 of these students in TRIO are disabledstudents and 25000 are veteransSo here we have a really diverse group of students who take advantageof these TRIO Programs but they have one thing in commonthey are alllowincome students They are all students who are disadvantaged by nothaving wealthy parents who can send them to prep schools These arestudents we are depending on to become that next generation ofengineers scientists and biologists They are the people who aregoing to correct the conditions of our lakes of our forests and whowill be these innovators Yet of all the lowincome students in ourcountry only 41 percent enroll in college and after 6 years in theseStudent Support Services we find that almost 31 percent of thesestudents actually attain a bachelors degree and that only 21 percentliterally 10 percent fewer of them graduate from college when you haveonly given them Pell GrantsI guess that is one of the problems that you have tried to share withus today which is If you are going to spend 27 billion and are goingto make that kind of important investment in financial aid it sure isimportant to give these students the wraparound services that theyneed perhaps some remediation in math and in reading so that they cansucceed some support servicesIf you will indulge me Mr Scott I will tell you a little storyI was pregnant at 18 years old when I graduated from high school andI was not headed to college As a matter of fact I was at the thenBoys Clubit was not the Boys and Girls Club I was at the BoysClub watching the boys play basketball when a young man walked up tome and said The director of the Educational Opportunity Program inMarquette is looking for you and he said he wants you to come downthere right away Thats how I ended up in college18 years oldpregnantWhat these programs do is they actually interrupt the poverty cycleThey actually interrupted the sociological outcome for me to just be awelfare mom receiving food stamps with no hope of ever making animportant contribution to societySo I think that if we are looking at a longterm bang for our buckthese TRIO Programs and increasing the funding for these TRIO Programswill certainly do that because we cannot afford the downward slide thatyou have describedIm not sure that people have really understood the seriousness ofthis You mentioned that we were probably in the middle of the packAccording to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developmentwe are about 15th among 29 industrialized countries in collegecompletion rates That really has consequences because when you lookat China and at Japan and at South Korea these are countries that arenow the innovators in the world They are producing the engineersThere used to be a time when you saw Chinese students sitting inAmerican universities You dont really see that anymore They arestaying at home and are obtaining their baccalaureate degreesNow President Obama has indicated that he has a goal of producingthe highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020 Toreach that goal this Pell Grant increase is a part of that program Healso wants to expand the reach of community colleges wants to investFederal money in research and data collection and in other reforms tothe student loan program and wants to simplify the student aidprocessThe gentleman from Virginia those are very good intentions andyoure experienced on the Education and Labor Committee but I guessId like you to respond to whether or not just simply providingfinancial aid and collecting data will get us there  Reclaiming my time I guess what Imrecalling is a country where I mean we invented the telephone Weinvented the automobile the television the camera Google iPodWeve made major medical breakthroughs We discovered the cure Wediscovered Penicillin and practically eradicated polio by developingthe vaccine And weve done this because we have been number one in theworld for developing a brain trustSo I guess Im sort of curious about the statements that youve justmade that we no longer have the smartest students or the best workforceand that were no longer leading in innovation and technology  I was just looking at an article that waspublished in Forbes Magazine recently called Investing in AmericasFuture and one of the points that the author made was that inCalifornia twofifths of the States jobs are expected to requirecollege degrees by the year 2020 But the number of adults with thosecredentials will fall short So its not just a matter of providing anopportunity for middleclass and upperclass studentsWeve been joined by Congresswoman Sheila JacksonLee who has spokenoften about the need for businesses to have an educated workforce Iveheard her speak very passionately about how there are so many requestsamong our business leaders for foreign students to come into thecountry because we dont have an educated workforceAnd so gentleman Id like you to respond to that  Madam Speaker I am concerned about Iransirresponsible violations both of its commitments under the NuclearNonproliferation Treaty NPT and its agreements which it signed withthe International Atomic Energy Agency IAEAI share my colleagues conviction to stop an Iranian regime headed byAhmadinejad from getting nuclear weapons However I think we should doso without crippling the Iranian people as is noted in thislegislation towards whom the people of the United States have feelingsof friendship and hold in the highest esteem or crippling efforts toraise a unified and international response to Irans continuingnoncomplianceWhile we all recognize that the intention of this act is not topunish the Iranian people it does not escape me that the impact ofthese sanctions will result in more suffering for them nonethelessUpon introducing this bill in April the Chairman of the ForeignAffairs Committee noted his belief that this measure could have apowerfully negative impact on the Iranian economy For sanctions tobe truly crippling to Iran they have to cripple the people firstAt a time when the Iranian people have courageously challenged themullahs and the rulers in Iran by taking to the streets after theelections and recently again this month there is concern that thisunilateral approach may end up benefitting not hindering the regimeand sowing the anger of the Iranian people at the US not the IraniangovernmentUnilateral sanctions can have unintended consequences In a recentDear Colleague it was noted that in two recent instances Microsoftand Google each determined that they must deny instant messagingservices to the Iranian people that were previously available citingtheir duty to comply with US sanctions Apparently this medium hadbecome a popular way for protesters to get around increasing efforts bythe Iranian government to monitor their communications As a result mycolleagues warned that Congress must act quickly to ensure that weare not unwittingly doing the repressive work of the Iranian governmenton its behalfThe President is currently working with our international partnersnot only as part of a renewed diplomatic outreach effort but also tofashion a strong multilateral response if Iran continues to refuse tocooperate with the international communityIn testimony in October the State Department told Congress that itbelieves it has the authorities necessary to take strong action aloneand together with our international partners should they provenecessary to squeeze off financing of Irans nuclear weapons effortsFor example the Treasury Department can continue to use theauthority that it has used for over three years now to blacklistIranian banks and encourage international banks to avoid doing businesswith IranAs a result since 2006 the US has taken action against over 100banks government entities companies and people involved in Iranssupport for terrorism and its proliferation activities includingfreezing assets and preventing US persons wherever located fromdoing business with themRecently the Department wrote to express its concerns aboutcompanion Senate legislation to the bill before us today warning thatduring this crucial period of intense diplomacy to impose significantinternational pressure on Iran it was concerned that suchlegislation in its current form might weaken rather than strengtheninternational unity and support for these effortsIn this letter the Administration appealed for a delay of that billin order not to undermine its diplomacy at this critical junctureIsraeli officials have also made clear that broadbased internationalefforts including for sanctions are better than the unilateralapproach before us today Very recently Israeli Defense Minister EhudBarak noted that There is a need for tough sanctions    Somethingthat is well and coherently coordinated to include the Americans theEU the Chinese the Russians the IndiansI also share the concerns that some have that the legislation beforethe House today will disempowernot empowerthe President tobring this multination coalition together by taking away or limitinghis flexibility to use sanctions as necessary to assist diplomaticefforts Thats a very curious definition of empowermentIts as curious as saying that it is in the US national securityinterest and helps diplomacy to make it harder for the PresidentanyPresidentto use and waive sanctions when hethinks the timing best serves our efforts to put pressure on IranThe Presidents flexibility to conduct foreign relations anddiplomatic efforts to achieve a strong international consensus againstIran is not a loophole that needs to be closed but a vital tool thatneeds to be supported I am concerned that this bill as written wouldkeep our allies from working with us to address the threat from IranEarlier this year Nicholas Burns who served under theAdministrations of George HW Bush Bill Clinton and as George WBushs top State Department negotiator in efforts to thwart Iransnuclear program testified in dealing with Iran My mainrecommendation for this committee and the Congress however is topermit the President maximum flexibility and maneuverability as hedeals with an extraordinarily difficult and complex situation in Iranand in discussions with the international group of countriesconsidering sanctions It would be unwise to tie the Presidents handsin legislation when it is impossible to know how the situation willdevelop in the coming monthsAn action taken against Iranincluding sanctionsshould have thebroadest possible support in the international community According tothe Administration with wide international support sanctionsregimes can be enforced pressure can be sustained and Irans leadersare less able to shift the blame from themselves to the US for thepains caused by their behavior Even the Senate version of this samelegislation recognizes the limits of more US only sanctions Insection 111 of S 2799 it is noted that in general multilateralsanctions are more effective than unilateral sanctions at achievingdesired results from countries such as IranInternational pressure for Iran to act or to face more forcefulinternational action is building as evidenced by the recent IAEA votecondemning Iran for its Qom enrichment facilitiesAll five vetowielding members of the Security Council China andRussia included voted for that measure which opens up the potentialfor another round of Security Council sanctionsThe progress in uniting the Security Council is attributable toPresident Obamas investment in diplomacy If Congress moves forwardwith sanctions that target our allies that unity may very wellcollapseSanctions have a place I am a cosponsor of HR 1327 the IranEnabling Sanctions Act of 2009 which passed the House with my supportby a vote of 4146 on October 29th There are even provisions of thislegislation which are worthwhile and which I have supported in the pastas standalone legislation HR 957 in the 110th Congress that makeclear that current US sanctions can be used against financialinstitutions insurers underwriters guarantors and any otherbusiness organizations including foreign subsidiaries that aidinvestment in Irans energy sectorHowever the less united the international community is in applyingpressure against Iran the greater the risk our measures will not havethe impact we seek And given the gravity of the stakes at risk herethat would be truly regrettableAs noted by Secretary of State Clinton just yesterday we havepursued under President Obamas direction a dualtrack approach toIran We have reached out We have offered the opportunity to engage inmeaningful serious discussions with our Iranian counterparts    Thesecond track of our dualtrack strategy is to bring the internationalcommunity together to stand in a united front against the IraniansI hope that as this legislation moves forward in the legislativeprocess further changes will be made to strengthen this bill in a waythat will truly enhance and not hobble strong diplomatic efforts todiplomatically engage with Iran as well as to enact multilateralsanctions  This administration has been very good onfinancial aid and this Congress has been great in providing financialaid As a matter of fact between fiscal years 2001 and 2009 the PellGrant has seen an increase of over 27 billion Now these TRIOPrograms that you talk about have a funding level of 853 million Thatis less than 1 billion to the Pell Grant of 27 billionWhile providing financial aid to students is a great strategy canyou tell me why you think it is so important to fund these TRIOPrograms in addition to the Pell Grant Arent we making a big enoughinvestment in Pell  Will the gentleman yield  Speaker its such a privilege to standin the well of the House of RepresentativesEach time I stand here I just shiver and shake and think about justhow I got here and the unusual circumstances that have allowed me to behere Really coming from a very poor background parents who had veryvery meager means But it was because of an educational opportunitythat Im able to be here with you and to speak with you here thiseveningYouve heard it all from the well of the House of RepresentativesMr Speaker Youve heard about all of the problems that we have in oureconomy And this evening I want to talk to you about the importance ofreestablishing ourselves in the world as a nation that is graduatingstudents from college and producing the next generation of innovatorsand engineers and doctors and scientists and teachers so that we canreestablish ourselves in the world and continue to enable our economyto grow But of course youve heard about all of the problems thatsort of crowd out a really important discussion about the importance offunding educational opportunityYouve heard about the two wars and the escalation which is going tocost us 30 billion Youve heard about the war spending Between 2001until 2009 weve spent just under 950 billion for Iraq andAfghanistan and weve just included another 139 billion for bothwars In July the DOD was spending 11 billion a month on both warsAnd CRS projects that were going to be spending another 400 billionto 900 billion in the next 10 yearsYouve heard about the entitlement programs Medicare and SocialSecurity and how theyre in danger and how we have to fund thatYouve heard about the escalating health care costs consuming 20 centsof every consumer dollar in the socalled takeover by the government ofhealth care Youve heard about the great recession where as many as700000 jobs were lost in a single month in the last 15 months Youveheard about the financial systemic risk that threatens the economy notonly of the United States of America but of the world requiringcountries including this one to develop billions of dollars instimulus funding Youve heard about various proposals to rightourselves and to justify our economy Youve heard proposals to justsimply reduce spending Youve heard proposals to give tax breaks tothe wealthy and that these tax breaks will somehow trickle down tosupport those workers and small businesses And youve even heardwhispers of raising taxes And very few people raise as a solution tothis problem at looking hard at what were doing in terms ofadvancing postsecondary educational opportunityThats why this evening Mr Speaker Im so happy to be joined by mydear friend and colleague from Virginia Representative Bobby Scottwho serves on the Labor and Education Committee and Im sure will giveus some valuable information about the importance of preparing the nextgeneration of students  Will the gentleman yield please   Will the gentleman yield  Gentleman you indicated I heard you saythat we need to get all of our kids prepared to go to college And Imwondering if we arent concerned about class warfare We talked aboutthose parents who are not low income Theyve gone to college Theyvehad a college fund for their children early on And perhaps these areparents who might feel somewhat resentful that theres a program outthere that provides supportive services for lowincome students as Iindicated I mean 41 percent of lowincome students justI mean ifyoure not an athlete and you can win a scholarship you know ifyoure not summa cum laude valedictorian of your high school youmight not have access to scholarship fundsWhat would you say to those parents who do have a baccalaureatedegree about the need to make sure we give access to all students tocollege Im so happy this evening that weve been joined by CongresswomanSheila JacksonLee from Houston Texas and I would yield to her atthis timeMs JACKSONLEE of Texas Let me thank the distinguished gentleladyfrom the great State of Wisconsin for her persistence in the work thatI found her doing when I visited her district some several years agoShe has been persistent and consistent and Im delighted to join herthis evening along with my friend and colleague from Virginia Iserved with Bobby Scott as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on CrimeBut he has redefined that committee and he realizes with hisexperience on the Education and Labor Committee that we are going downthe wrong direction And I combine the idea of steering people awayfrom a life of crime or the mistakes that weve made in the criminaljustice system with the poor response that we have given to oureducation system I really think that we have or we took our educationsystem for granted It was there We were at a point in our lives inthe 19th century the 20th century most particularly when we werereally churning in the economy and we were at the cutting edge ofinvention We had televisions we were doing transistor radios we didthe telephone We were really if you will at the peak of the envy ofall the world and we took for granted that individuals would startschool public school by the way and they would finish school andsome would finish high school but they would still be at an economiclevel that they could provide for their families And others went tocollege And so Im listening to this discussion about ourinternational competitiveness and I read this sentence to you Americano longer has the smartest students or the smartest workforce in theworldI would take issue with that and say that we have the smart peoplebut we have not cultivated them and provided them the support systemthat a TRIO provides a steering Its almost as if you had a playingfield and you told people to just get out on that playing field Therewere no guidelines there were no bases to make there were notouchdowns to make and what would you get Youd have very poorresults But if you had some guidelines if you told them that they hadto go from one point to the next that they had to kick the ball intothe field goal area or they had to make a touchdown or they to hadhit a home run And thats why Ive come to the floor today because Iwant to share these statistics but I want to refute these statisticsand I want to say its time now to go back to the old to reinvest inour education as if we cared about itAnd so let me cite these numbers that may have already been put intothe Record but I believe its important that show the 2007 trends ininternational mathematics and science study which is really a baby ofmine Ive been on or served on the Science Committee for 12 years Inthat my emphasis was math and science and NASA and what NASA can do toinspire our young people to want to be scientists and mathematiciansIt measures the math and science knowledge of fourth and eighthgradersOur students dont perform like those in competitor nations Only 10percent of US fourth graders and 6 percent of US eighth gradersscored at or above the international average in math That means that94 percent of our eighth graders are getting beat by countries likeSingapore Hong Kong England and Russia and Kazakhstani studentsscored better in math than our own fourth graders What does that meanIt means that there is a legitimate argument for TRIO because TRIOprovides the kind of road map that gives you the support systems thatreally cause students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds to get tothe finish line to be able to kick the goal to make the touchdown tomake the home runAnd I believe that weve been lax in the funding Its always easy tocut funding for the vulnerable We dont have to worry about anyfunding forthe vulnerable because their voices cannot be heard We know that justacross the country the University of either Southern California orBerkley has students who have been picketing and sitting in for weeksbecause of tuition increases So we know how disadvantaged students aremore disadvantaged as they raise tuition costs and they dont havesupport systemsSo for example here is what TRIO has done college going rates forTRIO versus nonTRIO students All lowincome students 41 percentenrolled in college Upward Bound participants 773 percent UpwardBound MathScience 865 percent and Talent Search 79 percentWhat is there to convince that TRIO works that the support systemworksStudent Support Services lowincome bachelor degree attainment witha 6year period Student Support Services 309 percent receive Pellbut no support 21 percent way down receive neither Pell nor support89 percent They just dont make it Will the gentlelady yieldMs JACKSONLEE of Texas Ill be happy to yield This is the question I have for my colleagueshere If its so clear as youve indicated gentlelady from Texasthat TRIO works if its so clear as the gentleman from Virginia hasindicated that we need in order to remain globally competitive and tocontinue to be the innovative country and to really develop a way todevelop and create new revenues for our country were not going tojust cut spending and raise taxes and have that be adequate forremaining a firstclass nationIf its true that we dont have enough upperclass students who aregraduating from college that we can afford to ignore lowincome whitestudents lowincome African American students lowincome Hispanicstudents lowincome Asian students disabled students and veterans whoare in these programs if we cant afford to ignore them weve got tograb them and educate them so that we can meet those goals and thatbar why has TRIO been flat fundedWhat are the consequences of the fact that TRIO was flat fundedduring fiscal year 2006 and 2008 had just a minimal increase in 2009a minimal increase in 2010 and God bless him our AppropriationsChair Dave Obey added 20 million to TRIO this cycle but after allof the negotiations with the Senate only 5 million was retained inthat program What are the consequences of reducing these vitalservices to TRIO students and our remaining competitiveness of theworld We need at least 200 million for this programMs JACKSONLEE of Texas You are eloquent in crafting thefrustration that you experience and so many of us experience And doyou know what the answer is They just dont get it Not the friendsand allies who work so hard the chairman of the AppropriationsCommittee on the House side so many Members who understand what TRIOmeans but the overall thinkers about education and how to cut dollarsjust dont get itTRIO costs an average of about 1000 per student per year 1000Pell is estimated to spend approximately 25 billion helping over 7million students get aid The combination of a TRIO effort for astudent counters the tragedy and let me just retract that word and notutilize tragedy but when you look at it and you say we are thecountry that spent the 20th century just inventing about everything theworld now uses when we think of China we are glad that it has madegigantic steps of development It still is a developing nation and alot of what China has made its economic rise on has been what weinvented in the 20th century and now they make it in a cheaper mannerSo what we are losing is we are losing the genius of our inventionand inventiveness H1B is what youre talking about The H1B visashave become the popular response So Im not going to worry about thefact that our children dont know math and science Forget about itWell just import thousands upon thousandsI have no quarrel with them We just stood today and introduced acomprehensive immigration reform bill There is no quarrel with theidea that this Nation is a nation of laws and immigrants but there isa quarrel when we throw to the side those disabled those veteransthose disadvantaged students those children who have a single parentwho would not have the ability to be able to follow through on collegeSo what do we lose Again we lose the ability to invent for the nextgeneration We lose the scientific minds that are going to be at thecutting edge of finding the right kind of cure for HIVAIDS or stoppingthe H1N1 pandemic or finding a cure for cancer or being able to fixcrumbling bridges This is what we lose And frankly I believe we arelong overdue for the reckoning that comes with the idea that we areignoring our childrenI would like to just use as an example the fact what we call APclasses and advanced classes You poll and find out how many of thoseclasses are still being kept advanced placement Its all aboutbudget We dont respect or appreciate how much money good educationcan generate and I think that we lose our rightful competitive placein the world And I would much rather invest 1000 in TRIO than 1000in making war and taking a chance of losing one of our bright young menor bright young women who has gone on the front lines We appreciatethemBut what Im saying is we should give equal opportunity for those whoare either after their military service or in the midst of theirmilitary service or that want to go to school we should give them theopportunity to do so and that is what TRIO is all about Will the gentlelady yieldMs JACKSONLEE of Texas Id be happy to yield My colleague Representative Scott is a greatmentor of mine He serves on the Budget Committee and he is an experton one of the subjects that really consumes a great deal of time onthis floor and in our committees and thats the subject of the budgetdeficit and how we dig ourselves out of this hole And I guess I waswondering if he would shareIm sort of surprising him with thisquestion but I guess I would like for him to talk about the revenueoptions or the cutting options or how we got into this fiscal hole thatwe are in and what the role of educating and having an educatedworkforce will have on us ever being able to approach some sort ofdeficit reductionAnd I will yield to the gentleman  Thatis so importantYou know the Department of Education really bears this out They saya high school dropout earns about 18000 a yearof course thats iftheyre not costing us money in the prison systema high schoolgraduate 26000 a year an associates degree 38000 and abachelors degree 65000 When we consider our aging baby boomers wecertainly are going to need to make sure that we have a lot of higherincome individuals working toward all of these innovations that we areso capable of  Before I yield to the gentlelady I justwant to say that old adage pennywise and pound foolish I startedthis hour out by talking about all of the competing problems that wediscuss on this floor the cost of the war and cost of health carecosts of Medicare and Social Security those entitlement programs thecost of escalating the war in Afghanistan the great recession whereat its height 700000 jobs were lost in a single month the bailoutfunds for the too big to fail institutionsAnd so if we allow ourselves to get mired down in this and decidethat 200 million for an education program is just too much money thatwould be the perfect place to talk about pennywise and pound foolishwouldnt you agree gentleman  That was just amazinginformationThe gentlelady from Texas I would love to hear what you have to sayon this matterMs JACKSONLEE of Texas Well I think this discussion should be aroadmap but it also should be a primer a tutorial for us not headingtoward the disaster that we are heading toward We should heed some ofthe comments that have been madeI would like to build on this issue of the criminal justice systemwhich has just grown exponentially I would say to the gentlelady thatthere are at least 1 million persons in our prison system throughoutthe Nation It is known to be the largest prison system in thecivilized world It is called the prison industrial complex becausethere is so much money spent in incarcerating persons and it does notseem that we have gotten it again to invest on the front endSo I would just like to share with you according to the NationalCenter for Education Statistics which studies the math skills of 15yearolds throughout several industrialized countries our UnitedStates students ranked 25th internationally Why Probably not embracedby the TRIO concept the support system concept High school graduatesonly 75 percent I realize that TRIO goes forward into the collegearea but it means that these students are not getting support earlyHigh school graduation only 75 percent of firstyear high schoolstudents graduate within 4 years 25 percent of our students are leftbehind Today 1 in 10 24yearolds still lack a high school degreeAccording to the Alliance for Excellent Education 76 percent of whitestudents graduate in a 4year period compared with 55 percent ofHispanic students and 51 percent of African American students Therelies the crux of the need for TRIO because we need that kind ofinspirationLet me just finish The Alliance estimates that high school dropoutsfrom the class of 2008listen to this numberwill cost the UnitedStates 319 billion in lost wages over their lifetime Is there anydefense for not supporting TRIO for not funding it to the max so thatwe can draw these students through the high school period into thecollege and then see them graduate and invest that 319 billion intothe economic engine of this economy and on the other side havingskills that are marketable skillsI started out by saying that we have been cited as not having thesmartest students in this century or this time frame I said no theseare smart students we just have not given them the rules we have notlaid out the plan we have not directed them we have not provided themthe TRIO support system that can be so helpful in providing the kind ofeconomic engine for AmericaSo in this climate of high unemployment and all of this talk aboutcreating jobs we cannot ignore Americas education system for ourchildren Thank you so much gentlelady from HoustonTexas And thank you my dear friend and colleague on the BudgetCommittee and also on the Education and Labor CommitteeBefore we close out this hour I just want to sort of summarize whatwe have said here this eveningWe really admire this Congress and our President for really revampingtuition and making adequate tuition a priority It has been soimportant to revisit how we make student loans so that we dont justprovide funding for bankers that we actually use those funds forstudents to simplify student forms It is even important to invest inresearch about educational outcomesIt has been very very important to have seen the dramatic increasein the Pell Grant because without this tuition assistance studentswould not be able to make it Tuition assistance is a vital componentin helping lowincome and firstgeneration college students or anystudents get through college Without these dollars higher educationwould be unattainable for millions of students who rely on Pell to paythe bills But all too often Pell is a wasted investment for our lowincome kids because they dont have access to guidance counselors andtutors and the other types of support that come with the TRIO programsIt doesnt do the student or our country much good if we spendmillions on firstyear Pell recipients only to have those students dropout after their second or third year Thats not a sound investment Asound investment is making sure that when we commit to providingeducational resources for our most vulnerable kids we give them allthe tools to successfully see that journey throughThats why were here today This Congress has drastically increasedvital funding for Pell Grants I have been and will continue to be astaunchsupporter of that increased investment but I also know that millionsof those dollars will be wasted unless we also invest in the tools toget these students through collegeMore importantly our country our country our beloved country thatwe love so much and love so dearly and a country that has given us anamazing lifestyle of modern living is at risk if we dont educate thefuture workforce We have got to start with our tiny tots in earlyeducation but thats a more longterm goal Right now we are having anemergency an emergency students are either not graduating from highschool or they are graduating with deficienciesIn order to step up we need a TRIO program a modest amount offunding 200 million in the scheme of things nothing like we arespending on all the other crises in this country that would help theseprograms serve those students who are on waiting listsWith that I would yield to the gentleman from Virginia  This has been great this has been fantasticand I would say that the importance of this program is its diversityIt is not a program that just benefits one group of people Thirtyseven percent of TRIO students are white 35 percent are AfricanAmericans 19 percent are Hispanics 4 percent are Native Americans22000 of TRIOs students are disabled students and 25000 are ourbeloved veteransThis is a program that embraces every American from all backgroundsand makes sure that money is not the reason that you cannot use yourbrain Talk about a brain drain its a brain drain when the only thingthat stands between you and greatness is an educationThank you so much and good night
S_TN_ALEXANDER,2009-12-04, I might say we are operating under a colloquy managedby Senator MCCain So Republican Senators are free to engage indiscussion  President during the next 55 minutes we willhave several Republican Senators come to the floor I ask unanimousconsent that during that time Senator MCCain be allowed to be themanager of a colloquy among the Republican SenatorsThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Without objection it is soordered President before Senator MCCain begins if I mayI wish to take a moment to establish where we are today and whathappened yesterday as a leadin to what he is about to discussYesterday Senator MCCain offered an amendment on the floor of theSenate that would do two things It would send this 2074pageDemocratic health care bill back to the Finance Committee and say tothem No 1 take out the cuts in Medicare and No 2 any savings inMedicare must go to make Medicare more solvent That is what the MCCainamendment would have accomplished That was defeated FiftyeightDemocrats said yes to the cuts in Medicare They said yes to using themoney that comes from these cuts to create a new entitlement programForty Republicans and two Democrats said no we dont want cuts toMedicare and we do not want a new entitlement programSo yesterday we made it clear that the central core of this billincludes nearly 12 trillion in cuts to Medicare There is noquestion about that Everyone concedes that The President said thatwhen he addressed us The Congressional Budget Office says that Thequestion is whether it is a good idea or a bad idea and yesterday by58 votes the Democrats said yes to these cuts in MedicareToday we want to talk about one aspect of those cuts which isMedicare Advantage We are going to talk about these cuts in a carefulaccurate way so the 11 million seniors who have Medicare Advantageunderstand exactly what the risk is to their Medicare AdvantagepoliciesWe can see that a portion of the overall Medicare cuts that theDemocrats approved yesterday is a 120 billion cut over the next 10years to the Medicare Advantage program Now what is MedicareAdvantage Medicare Advantage is an option seniors have If you choosethis option Medicare pays a fixed amount every year for your care tocompanies that might come to you and offer a Medicare Advantage planwhich you can choose instead of the original Medicare planMany seniors choose these plans11 million seniors Nearly one outof four seniors in America who are part of Medicare chooses theMedicare Advantage plan In my home State of Tennessee the number isabout 230000 TennesseansWhy do they choose it Well it includes some benefits they may nothave in the original Medicare plan These benefits include dental carevision care hearing coverage reduced hospital deductibles lower copayments lower premiums coordinatedchronic care management and physical fitness programsThe distinguished Senator from Oregon was on the floor and hementioned grandma I have mentioned grandma a few timesno disrespectto grandpa he is in the same boat He said grandma didnt need toworry about her Medicare Advantage plan because none of the benefitswould be cut That is not what the Director of the CBO who is oftencited by the chairman of the Finance Committee has said He said thathalf of the benefits currently provided to seniors under MedicareAdvantage would disappear under the Finance Committee plan which ismuch like the plan we are considering The benefits that woulddisappear would include those I mentionedToday with Senator MCCain leading the discussion we wish to talkabout the Medicare Advantage plan and why cuts to Medicare Advantageplay a central part of this 25 trillion bill Cuts to Medicare payfor about half of that 25 trillion cost and the ones we are talkingabout today are the Medicare Advantage plans I understand there willbe an amendment by Senator Hatch who has joined us and I am sure hewill talk about his own amendment He was present on the FinanceCommittee when Medicare Advantage was created I understand there willbe an amendment to send this back to the Finance Committee saying dontcut Medicare Advantage  If the Senatorfrom Pennsylvania Senator Casey said that he is merely repeatingwhat the Director of the CBO stated when he said that fully half ofthe benefits of Medicare Advantage will be lostTo answer the Senators question Medicare Advantage is an optionthat 11 million of the 40 million seniors who are on Medicare havechosen The reason they choose it is because it is a plan offered byprivate companies often to people in rural areas often tominorities  Theyoften choose it because the plans generally offer these benefitsdental care vision care hearing coverage reduced hospitaldeductibles lower copayments lower premiums coordinated chroniccare management and physical fitness programs  President I see the Senator from Texas theSenator from Idaho and the Senator from Wyoming have all come to thefloor in addition to the sponsor of the motion Senator Hatch I amsure they are prepared to reflect on who is hurt by these cutsThe only thing I would emphasize is what the Senator from Arizona hassaid is that disproportionately lowincome Americans in Texas IdahoTennessee Wyoming and Utah are hurt Only onethird of eligible Whiteseniors who do not have Medicaid or employerbased insurance areenrolled in Medicare Advantage But the number increases to 40 percentfor African Americans and 53 percent for Hispanics  That it is thereason 11 million Americans choose Medicare Advantage because thesebenefits are not available under the original Medicare plan  I wonder if I might ask the Senator from Idaho to goback over a point he made a moment ago because he went over it quicklyand it is such an important point and one reflected by the chart behindhim about what he just said Repeatedly we are told that seniors wontlose benefits if you cut nearly 12 trillion in Medicare So if youcould takea momentI believe you were in the Finance Committee markup where thebill was being written that was offered by the distinguished FinanceCommittee chairman and I believe you were talking to the head of theCongressional Budget Office who is often cited by our friends on theother side as the nonpartisan authority for exactly what the bill doesand you asked him whether the benefits of Medicare Advantage recipientswould be cut Would you describe that in a little more detail so peopleunderstand exactly the scenario  I would direct my comment to the Senator from NewHampshire too The President of the United States said something a fewweeks ago that I thought was profound and that I agreed with he saidthis debate is not just about health care it is about the role of theFederal Government in the everyday lives of the American people Ibelieve he is exactly right about that which is why so many Americansare turning against this billWould the Senator from New Hampshire agree the President was correctthat this debate is about in my words now Washington takeovers moretaxes more spending and more debt It is not just about health careThe enormous interest across the country in these votes comes from amuch larger picture than this health care bill
H_NC_FOXX,2009-12-16,I thank my colleague from Maine for yielding timeMadam Speaker the Department of Defense appropriations bill forfiscal year 2010 is intended to provide equipment and technology forour troops Our countrys greatest treasure lies in the bravery in thededication and in the ability of or servicemen and women Thesecourageous individuals protect our freedoms every dayWe thank them and we thank their families for their supportdedication and sacrificeThis bill provides topoftheline medical care for our troopsincluding funding for traumatic brain injury and psychological healthThis bill provides funding for wounded ill and injured servicemembersas well as for cancer research This bill provides our military with apay increase and it continues efforts to end the practice of stoplosscompensating troops for every month their terms of service willbe involuntarily extended in 2010 This bill includes funding toprovide support for our countrys military families who sacrifice everyday on behalf of our Nation and to whom we owe a great debt This billprovides our troops with firstclass military equipment and readinesstraining ensuring they are fully prepared to successfully performtheir missionsHowever while this bill contains funding for several important andnecessary initiatives I would be remiss if I did not mention mydisappointment in the overall funding levels when compared to theincreases we have seen throughout the appropriations season this yearWhile the bill does receive roughly a 45 percent increase over lastyear this increase is not comparable to nondefense appropriationsbills we have voted on this year which average a 12 percent increasein funding levels As we have noted before the Federal Government isthe only unit of government to provide for our national securityThese represent the wrong priorities of the Democrats who are incharge of the Congress and of the Obama administration Increasingspending for domestic priorities by double digits while in comparisonshortchanging national defense represents a dangerous wrongheadedpolicy that does not rightly prioritize the security of our NationThus while I am pleased that several items in this bill are beingfunded in order to provide our troops with the tools training andmedical services they need and deserve I am disappointed that afterincreasing the funding levels for domestic appropriations bills by anaverage of 12 percent the Democrats in control decided only toincrease our defense spending by 45 percentless than halffor thecoming yearThis is the last appropriations bill and that is because it has beenheld in order for the majority to put into it things that are notrelated which I will be discussing a bit more but the substance ofthe DOD appropriations bill is not the source of my concernThe extent of the closed rule before us today allows for theconsideration of a variety of additional legislation that has beencobbled together without committee consideration As my colleagues havesaid before our colleagues across the aisle have gone to great lengthsto shut down debate Therefore I urge my colleagues to vote no onthe rule so the bill can be returned to the committee and can bebrought back under regular orderMadam Speaker I reserve the balance of my time  Madam Speaker I would now like to yield 3 minutes to myvery distinguished colleague from Texas one of only five CPAs in theHouse Mr Conaway  Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman fromCalifornia  I am happy to yield 1 minute to the gentleman fromColorado  Madam Speaker as we approach the Christmastime too manyAmericans are asking Where are the jobs In January the unemploymentrate was 76 percent Only 10 months later the national unemploymentreached a whopping 102 percent the highest level since April 1983That means today there are 157 million unemployed Americans lookingfor workHouse Republicans have an economic recovery plan that will help getAmericans back to work Our economic recovery plan will create twicethe jobs at half the cost of the Democrats failed stimulus planHow ironic that our colleagues are coming to the floor today to talkabout the need for jobs when it is their votes and the policies of thisPresident that have killed so many jobsIts time we started working on behalf of the American people andfocus on real commonsense solutions that will help put people get backto work and let them celebrate Christmas in a wonderful way  Madam Speaker I appreciate my colleague yielding the timethis morningI want to say that it seems every time we come here we have to do alittle bit of correcting peoples memory and their recollection ofhistory My colleague just said when they took over the majority wehad a 13 trillion deficit I think if she will check her facts shewill see that the 13 trillion deficit came about as a result of theDemocrats taking over the majority She may not have been here in2007 but when they took over the majority I believe that the deficitwas 259 billion and they made it 13 trillion this year with theirDemocratic PresidentWe are here considering a sameday martial law rule Now Iunderstand that there are times when we need to move quickly when weare faced with an immediate crisis However I think the wordcrisis has been overused particularly this year We havent hadmuch by way of crisis this year and yet theyre trying to make it acrisis by bringing in this again sameday martial law ruleThe Rules Committee met last night at 845 We didnt get the text ofthe bills that were going to be debating and the rule that were goingto approve again in a few minutes or a little while so weve had verylittle time to be able to deal with these things But weve known aboutthis for a long long time Weve known that the funding for thegovernment would run out Friday night for over a month So what have webeen doing during that period of time when we should have beenpreparing for this dayLet me give some ideas on what weve been doing by reading out someof the bills that weve been voting on on the floor expressing supportfor designation of November 29 2009 as Drive Safer Sunday surelysomething that the country could not live without without our votingon it expressing support for designation of the week beginning onNovember 9 2009 as National School Psychology Week anotherextraordinarily importantissue for us to be dealing with recognizing the 60th anniversary ofthe Berlin Airlifts success Certainly I am extremely proud of thefact that Ronald Reagan helped end the Cold War by opening up BerlinBut I dont think that really needed to be done by a vote on thisfloorAnd then the one that I really think tops the cake and will get theattention of the American people honoring the 2560th anniversary ofthe birth of Confucius and recognizing his invaluable contributions tophilosophy and social and political thought The fact that 2560 yearshave passed since the birth of Confucius and we hadnt acknowledged itI really think that could have waited a little bit longer in terms ofthe importance of the work that we are doingSo here we are again doing what our colleagues across the aisle havebeen so good at this session shortcircuiting the legislative processso we can jam through another major spending bill without the benefitof Members or more importantly the citizens of this country havingthe opportunity to read itThis rule enables us to take up the next rule and that rule will letthe House consider more than 1 trillion in spending all done almostin the blink of an eye if you put it in the context of the birth ofConfucius But let us not be fooled by this attempt to say thatsomething is a crisis The reason we are doing this on the spur of themoment is because our Speaker and several Members are going to leavetoday to go to Copenhagen to talk with people about climate controlAnd theyre going to emit much much carbon on their way to do thatwhich really is sort of hypocritical in terms of what the conference isall about So we have folks talking out of both sides of their mouthshere over and over and over againMadam Speaker I reserve the balance of my time  Madam Speaker I now yield such time as he may consume tothe distinguished gentleman from California and ranking member of theRules Committee Mr DreierMr DREIER asked and was given permission to revise and extend hisremarks  Madam Speaker I find it very interesting that my colleaguefrom Maine says we find ourselves here at the end of the Bushadministration We have been in the Obama administration for a yearyet our colleagues across the aisle cannot stop hearkening back toPresident Bush and blaming him for everything that has happened in thiscountry in the last year when President Bush hasnt been in office andwhile the Republicans have not been in control The Democrats are incontrol They have been in control of the Congress for 3 yearsThey actually inherited from President Bush and from the Republicancontrolled Congress a very excellent economy55 straight months of jobgrowth In the first month that the Democrats took over the Congressthe economy started going downhill and we can document that very veryeasily It isnt the Bush administration that deserves the blame forthe ills of the economy its the Democratcontrolled Congress whichbegan in January of 2007 which is when the economy started going sourI want to go back to the issue at hand which is Why do we haveclosed rules Why do we have a sameday martial law rule Why isntthere time for us to debate the important issues that the Americanpeople want us to be debatingWhy is it as my colleague from California has pointed out that ourmost important function that being the defense of this Nation and theappropriations for that part of the countrywhich can be done by no other group of people in this country as theStates cant do it and the locals cant do itis left to be done on aday when everybody is trying to get out for Christmas and we are doingit in a rushThe Members arent allowed to read the bill The 72hour rule hasgone out the window Nobody is allowed to read the bill because thereis not enough time to do it We have been operating as my colleaguesaid under closed rules with bills with no amendments while we aredoing things like recognizing the Grand Concourse on its 100thanniversary as the preeminent thoroughfare in the borough of the Bronxand as an important nexus of commerce and culture for the City of NewYorkThat is how our colleagues want to spend their time which is bydealing with issues that are not a part of our critical job here in theHouse of Representatives by dealing with things that could have beendone on a voice vote but we have to have no amendments allowed and nodebate time because there isnt time to do these things according tothe chairman of the Appropriations Committee and this is what we aredoingMadam Speaker I had an opportunity this week to once more visitArlington National Cemetery It is always a sobering thing to do Iwent particularly to the active duty section this time where men andwomen who are currently serving our country have lost their lives Itgets ones attention There were parents and relatives there grievingwho had recently lost loved ones I visited the eternal flame of JohnKennedy I dont have to be reminded of his comments in his inauguralspeech Ask not what your country can do for you Ask what you can dofor your countryWe are in a totally different time as my colleague has said We arein a time where we have people representing this country who wantwealth redistribution They want to take money from some people andgive it to othersIn fact that seems to be their entire focus spread the wealtharound take up time on frivolous issues Dont deal with whatsimportant dont deal with national security because we really dontwant to talk about that Thats not whats important But that is whatis important to usI watched the soldiers who guard the Tomb of the Unknowns and I wasgiven some insight into the preparation that they have for that job andhow difficult it is to get itWould that Members of Congress had a tiny little percentage of thededication that these soldiers have for doing their jobs They doeverything with perfection Perfection is not just the goal it is thestandard that those people live up to We are falling far short of thestandard that our military people uphold for our countryWe are so fortunate that we have men and women willing to serve andhave been willing to serve since the founding of this country ThisCongress is falling short of the goals that they setI support our military I support the funding for our military andour troops the equipment the medical care and all that we are goingto appropriate but I dont support this martial law way of operatingI dont support the arrogance of this administration and this Congressto bring things up at the last minute and to disregard the needs ofthose peopleTo put on the bills things that are irrelevant things they dontthink they can pass any other way what a travesty what a shame Whata shame on this Congress that we are doing this bill at the last minuteand that we are putting these things on hereWe should be voting on appropriations for our military and honoringthem here just before the holidaysMadam Speaker I will ask my colleagues to vote no on this sameday rule and no on the next rule so that we could stop and debatethis and not be up against a deadline for a group of our Members to goto Copenhagen adding to the carbon problem while they are going overthere to talk about itI yield back the balance of my time The yeas and nays were ordered The yeas and nays were orderedA recorded vote was ordered  Madam Speaker I now would like to yield 3 minutes toanother distinguished colleague from Texas Mr Hensarling  Madam Speaker I now would like to yield to a thirdcolleague from Texas Mr Culberson who has come to speak againstthis rule one of the most fiscally conservative Members of the Housesuch time as he may consume  Madam Speaker the West continues to be wellrepresentedhere I now yield 3 minutes to our colleague from Arizona Mr Flake  Madam Speaker having a charge of misspeaking is veryserious I would like therefore to yield such time as he may consumeto the gentleman from Arizona Mr Flake to speak again on the rule  Madam Speaker I want to say thank you to our colleaguefrom Arizona for his very valuable input on the issue of earmarks andsay that I join him in opposing all earmarks in any of our bills untilwe fix this broken system And I think what we need is a study of howthese specific earmarks then get awarded since there seems to be opencompetition And I would welcome the majority to institute such a studyand just see how open the competition isI now yield 3 minutes to my colleague from Iowa Mr King  Madam Speaker you know Im sitting here listening to thecrocodile tears particularly of my colleague from Maine who spokeearlier about the many people in her district who want to have jobsAnd it is the very policies that she and her party have passed in thissession of Congress that have caused those people to lose their jobsWhat we need to do is let the American people keep their money Theirmoney It is not the governments money It is the hardearned money ofthose who work in this countryAnd let me point out even President Obama has said and Im going toquote November 18 2009 It is important though to recognize if wekeep on adding to the debt even in the midst of this recovery that atsome point people could lose confidence in the US economy in a waythat can actually lead to a double dip recessionBut what are we doing today Adding to the debt with the support ofthe President Do they think the American people are not payingattention To the contrary more than ever the American people arepaying attention to whats going on in this Congress and they havespoken in many many ways They have spoken through the polls theyhave spoken through election polls in terms of where theyre votingand theyre telling us every day this is not what they want thisCongress to be doingThey also are aware of the fact that this Congress is breaking everypromise that it made before the majority was elected And I want tosay with apologies to Elizabeth Barrett Browning and her sonnet No43 how many ways can we count the promises that have been brokenMany many ways Too many ways to talk about todayBut let me give some examplesone from Majority Leader HoyerI think that is a very important pursuit Our committees andMembers are served on both sides of the aisle by pursuing regularorder Regular order gives to everybody the opportunity to participatein the process in a fashion which will effect in my opinion the mostconsensus and best productAgain a letter to Majority Leader Hoyer from members of the DemocratBlue Dog and New Democratic Caucuses which saidCommittees must function thoroughly and inclusively andcooperation must ensue between the parties and the Houses to ensurethat our legislative tactics enable rather than impede progress Ingeneral we must engender an atmosphere that allows partisan games tocease and collaboration to succeed We look forward to working with youto restore this institutionAnd what are we getting Just the opposite Even Speaker Pelosiendorsed the idea of regular order with her spokesperson stating at thetimeThe Speaker prefers to consider legislation in regular order andthe committees of jurisdiction held hearings and markups on the currenteconomic recovery bill In a few cases because of urgent financialcrises the leadership agreed to use expedited proceduresLest we forget promises Democrats made in their 2006 documententitled A New Direction for America which promised thatBills should be developed following full hearings and opensubcommittee and committee markups with appropriate referrals to othercommittees Members should have at least 24 hours to examine a billprior to consideration at the subcommittee levelAnd weve pointed out its barely been 12 hours since this bill thebill underlying this rule was presentedBills should generally come to the floor under a procedure thatallows open full and fair debate consisting of a full amendmentprocess that grants the minority the right to offer its alternativesincluding a substituteAs Mr Dreier pointed out earlier this is the first Congress in thehistory of this country that has not allowed thatMembers should have at least 24 hours to examine bill andconference report text prior to floor consideration Rules governingfor debate must be reported before 10 pm for a bill to be consideredthe following dayWe can go on and on and on about promises broken The President saidbills would be available for 72 hours The President promised he wouldpost bills 5 days before signing them He said he would read every billline for line and he said there would be no earmarks He would vetobills with earmarksThis is a bill with 1700 earmarks Is he going to veto the bill Idoubt itSo here we have one promise after another thats broken How can theAmerican people believe anything that is said by the other side afterthisAgain theyre paying attention I know theyre paying attention andI believe that there will be consequences to the fact that thesepromises have been brokenMadam Speaker I will enter into the Record a letter written byRepublicans 173 of us to Speaker Pelosi on December 11 2009 askingthat we not continue this practiceWashington DCDecember 11 2009Hon Nancy PelosiSpeaker of the House The CapitolWashington DCDear Madam Speaker We write today to express our strongopposition to reports that the Democrat Majority isconsidering attaching unrelated and extremely controversialproposals such as an increase in the public debt limit tothe Fiscal Year 2010 Defense Appropriations bill We objectto maneuvers to use our troops as leverage to enact proposalsthat the Majority either cannot pass on their own or forwhich they wish to avoid directly voting on and we willoppose a Defense Appropriations package that includes suchprovisionsUnfortunately there seems to be a pattern developing thisyear of using legislation that supports our men and women inuniform to pass other contentious proposals that areextraneous to our troops We should supply those who risktheir lives for our country with the resources they needwithout conditions and without using them to accomplish otherlegislative goals House Republicans stand ready to help theMajority enact a defense bill that meets the needs of ourtroops but we will not assist your effort to use the troopsto enact an increase in our national debt limit so as tofinance the irresponsible spending policies of your partyWith that I reserve the balance of my time  Madam Speaker I would just like to point out its not therole of Federal Government to provide jobs Its not our job to takemoney from some and give to others to try to make them dependent onthe governmentI urge my colleagues Madam Speaker to defeat the previous questionso an amendment can be added to the rule The amendment to the rulewill provide for separate consideration of House Resolution 554 aresolution to require that legislation and conference reports be postedon the Internet for 72 hours prior to consideration by the House anddoes not affect the bill made in order by the ruleI will insert the text of the amendment and extraneous materialsimmediately prior to the vote on the previous question and I ask mycolleagues to vote no on the previous question and the ruleI yield back the balance of my time The yeas and nays were ordered A recorded vote was ordered  Speaker at the close of 2009 as we look to andprepare for a new year Im prompted to call attention to theremarkable American people who have once again weathered a difficultyear with dignity and toughness Sometimes the Washington establishmentforgets that the solutions to Americas problems lie outside thiscapital cityYes Americans from almost every walk of life are tightening theirbelts and making due with less this year but Americans continue to bean extraordinarily resourceful people who inspire me in my work everydayAs we prepare to celebrate Christmas entering in a new year I hopewe can all draw inspiration from the American people We live in aNation of innovators and hardworking entrepreneurs Theirresourcefulness is unlimited The spirit of American opportunity livesand thrives among themAnd lets not forget the North Carolinians who with theircharacteristic generosity and work ethic illustrate the greatness atwork in America even in seasons of considerable difficulty I look tothem as a source of inspiration and hope People like those who callNorth Carolina home have always been the best hope for the preservationof our tradition of individual liberty and government by and for thepeople whether in good times or badMr Speaker Washington would do well to stop and watch listen andlearn from everyday Americans as they go about their lives and do thethings that help make our Nation greatMay God continue to bless us all
S_OK_COBURN,2009-12-20, It was raised in the FinanceCommittee markup it was raised in the health care markup I havebehind me the Medicare cuts and I understand they have been slightlyreduced in home healthin the rebuildbut we are going to cutMedicare We are not going to cut it significantly in the fraud2billion That is where the real waste isThe Senator from Rhode Island came down here and said we are tryingto scare people but when we offered the opportunity for the chairmanof the committee to prohibit rationing of health care in this countryboth the chairman and the Senator from Rhode Island voted against itIt was simple straightforward saying no matter what we do in healthcare we are not going to do what other countries have done and thatis ration health care Straight upanddown votespartyline votesagainst itIn fact we are going to ration health care That is what this billdoes The way we are going to control cost is through the mechanismsoutlined in this bill that are going to allow government bureaucrats todecide what you can get treated for when you can get treated for itand where you can get treated for it The rebuttal to that is InMedicare it is already illegal for them to ration care so we dontneed a prohibition The fact is Medicare is rationing right now Theyare rationing virtual colonoscopies they are rationing bonedensitometry they are rationing Epogen they are rationing Neupogentwo key drugs to maintain survival during the treatment ofchemotherapy They are practicing medicineSo when given the opportunity to vote and put an absolute prohibitionon the rationing of health care what did the chairman of the FinanceCommittee do He voted against that Because what he recognizes is theultimate plan And the answer to Senator Burrs question is This willcollapse It is not going to be sustainable The Medicare cuts wont bemade by us We will put it off on a commission and say Oh we had todo it and the result of that will be rationingThe other result will be what the Senator from Vermont actuallywants which is a singlepayer governmentrun system That is why heis intellectually honest He brought it to the floor and said this ishow I think we ought to solve health care We ought to have thegovernment run it and we ought to have the government make thedecisions He was honest about it That is where this bill is going Soif you are a Medicare patient you should be concerned If you are aMedicare Advantage patient you should be concernedI have had criticism leveled at me because I do what the chairman ofthe Finance Committee suggestsI make competitive bidding for MedicareAdvantage But there is a big difference Mine has no cuts in benefitsThey cut benefits 50 percent in terms of the Medicare AdvantagedifferentialThere are three things you can do to fix health care in this countryYou can incentivize prevention and the treatment of chronic diseasebased on outcome you can create transparency so that purchasers in themarket can actually make a judgment about value and quality and youcan assist those who are on the lower rungs of the economic ladder toget the same kind of care we get Those are the three things you candoI readily admit we dont have a great competitive model in theinsurance industry I want to change that We had Senator Wyden come tothe floor and say that he loves the free enterprise spirit yet we wantto put an artificial fix in terms of the insurance company in terms ofwhat you have to have for a return What if an insurance company cameup with 20 percent greater efficiency in terms of outcomes andbenefits They still have to spend that money In the name of the freeenterprise system we are going to kill free enterprise As a practicingphysician I bristle at the way I run into insurance companies Thereis no question about it We need to fix thatThe point Senator Burr was making is this says it is this way or thehighway when the option we offeredthe Patients Choice Actcutstaxes doesnt raise taxes expands exactly to the level or beyond ofthis bill and it does at in a faster rate It extends the life ofMedicare It gives Medicaid patients the same kind of care we get Butit was defeated in committee on a partyline vote It was filed as anamendment here but not accepted We had 10 amendments voted on from ourside on 2400 pages of legislation10 amendments So it is not aboutbeing bipartisan it is about you have to take this or leave itWhat the American people ought to pray for is that somebody cantmake the vote tonight That is what they should be praying for so thatwe can actually get the middlenot me not mine I understand I am wayover here But we ought to get the middle of America and the middle ofthe Senate a bill that can run through this country and actually dowhat we say we all want to do There is a large difference of opinionand it is not rhetoric that is unfounded as Senator Burr outlined andas Dr Barrasso outlined with an estimate by NFIB of 16 million jobslost That may be old data because who knows what the data is now Wehavent had a chance to look at it because 30 hours after the bill isintroduced for cloture and the cloture motion is filed we are going tovote on it I am not sure this is a great way to run the countryWhat is in the bill There are zero guarantees that taxpayers wontfinance abortionThere are zero prohibitions on the rationing of health carezeroThere is not one shred of evidence that we are not going to ultimatelyration health care under this bill We are And the only reason youwould vote against a rationing amendment is because you intend to seerationing carried outThere are zero Senators required to enroll in either Medicaid or agovernmentrun option either through OPM or MedicaidThere are now 10 new taxes created There are 71 new governmentprograms created There are 1697 times that the Secretary of HHS isgoing to write the regulations and based on CRS calculations there arebetween 15000 and 20000 new Federal employees who are going to berequired to carry out this legislationThere are 3607 times before we got the Reid amendment that thelegislation says the word shall Shall is a very important wordbecause the word shall takes away your options There is no optionwhen the word shall is used The word shall also says whoeveris directing the shall obviously has more wisdom more knowledgemore experience than the person the shall is applied toWhat we have said is in all our wisdom in all our many years ofpracticing medicine and being involved in the care of patients that3607 times we are going to tell the American people what to doOne of the big shall alsos that I do not think will ever holdscrutiny before the Supreme Court is you shall buy an insurancepolicy That doesnt fit anywhere in the Constitution that I read Ifyou do the legal research on it as my staff lawyers from the JudiciaryCommittee have done it is highly unlikely that will ever hold up Sothe whole premise of a large portion of the taxes collected in thisbill will be out the windowIt also will totally change through adverse selection all of theinsurance premiums in this country because if you do not have anindividual mandate making people buy insurance the costs relative tothe illness and the age even though we have compressed the ratioswill rise exorbitantlyThere are still going to be 24 million people left without healthinsurance in this country There is a 10 billion cost just for the IRSimplementation of this bill There is at least 25 billion in mandatesplaced on the States unfunded mandates Actually it is much highernow There is 28 billionplus in new taxes on employers There is 100billion by conservative estimates in fraud and Medicare and Medicaida year and this bill goes after 2 billion over 10 years So we aregoing to go after 2 billion out of 1 trillionnot 200 billion not20 billionwe are going after 2 billionThere is 118 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage but only forthose people who do not live in the State of Florida and a couple ofother places If you happen to live in Oklahoma citizens under theMedicare Advantage are going to loseThis is now over 500 billion in new taxes on Americans There is aquarter of a trillion dollars not in this in expense that everybodyknows is an expense We are going to restore the SGR We are going tofix that And that quarter of a trillion dollars is based on noincrease in physicians over the next 10 years How many in this bodythink we are not going to increase the pay of physicians in Medicareunder the next 10 years The assumptions in the CBO report thataccompanied the Reid amendment if you read what they said they saidit is highly unlikely So that is a quarter of a trillion dollars eventhough it was not in their numbersIt also said if in fact the cuts came through which they thoughthighly unlikely that they would and if they didnt then the fiscalnumbers associated with the bill are out the window The final numbereverybody ought to be paying attention to is 121 trillion 121trillion is what our kids owe outside of owing ourselves11trillion That is going to double in the next 10 yearsAnybody with a lick of common sense who looked at the numbers on thisbill would say Washington your accounting programs arent anydifferent from Enron The same fate of those who created the Enron scamought to apply to the Congress of the United States The very fact weare not considering an SGR fix is evidence of that At least you haveto add a quarter of a trillion dollars every 10 years to this bill justto keep doctors even And dont forget the fact that 34 million newAmericans over the next 10 years are going to enter Medicareare goingto enter MedicareWhat are the alternatives I will not offer other amendments and makethe chairman object to them because I know his answer He calls it astunt It is not a stunt when you do not have vigorous amendmentsoffered on the Senate floor It is not a stunt The stunt is notallowing amendments to be offered To allow only 10 of our amendmentsto be offered on this bill is beneath the dignity of the Senateon thebiggest bill in the last 100 years in this Congress the only bill inthe last 100 years that is going to affect every American in a personalway but also in a fiscal way a financial wayThere was an amendment to be offered a conscience protection forphysicians We didnt get a vote on it Should we force physicians inthis country to perform abortions or should we have a vote on whetherif they have a conscience protection they ought to be exempted fromthat Should that not be a part of health care reform We are not goingto get a vote on thatHow about an amendment to reduce the waste fraud and abuse inMedicare and Medicaid Programs and protecting Medicare benefits Andincreasing the fraud and waste from 2 billion to 100 billion over thenext 10 years that is just 10 percent of what is there We are notgoing to get a vote on that It is not going to be available TheAmerican people are not going to get to hear the debate on that Theyare not going to make up their mind Why You dont want them to hearthe debate on it If you truly wanted to have a debate on fraud wewould have a debate on fraud and we would have an amendment saying putyour stamp down or are you for the people who are defrauding Or areyou for the status quo We are for the status quo We are for the wellconnectedThe amendment on rationing that I talked aboutor an amendment tolimit the bureaucratic increase associated with this bill which is anamendment I offered we are not going to get a debate on that That isa very straightforward amendment It just says we are not going toincrease the number of bureaucrats to implement this bill We are goingto drive efficiency in HHS that is where this is going to We aregoing to say You cant get a net increase in bureaucrats so get moreefficient Since we are running 14 trillion or 15 trilliondeficits that is something that everybody else in the country would bedoing but we are not going to do that We are not going to allow anopportunity for a vote or debate on that We are not going to have thatopportunityI have heard the majority mention several times that we didnt haveanything to offer We offered the Patients Choice Act CBO said it cutlongterm costs on Medicaid that it saved money on Medicare They saidit saved 1 trillion over the first 10 years for the State and theestimates Because we couldnt get the commitment that was made to usby the chairman of the HELP Committee that he would score the bill thebill didnt ever get scored by CBObut an outside score says it savesat least 70 billion the first 10 years and far in excess of thatafterwards It covers more people than this bill saves personalchoice doesnt put somebody between you and your doctorI heard the Senator from Rhode Island say we were lying about thathappening It is happening today both from insurance companies andMedicare and Medicaid So if we really wanted to reform health care wewould be attacking that Instead we are going to make it worseLet me tell you how we are going to make it worse We are going touse cost comparative effectiveness which is exactly what the US TaskForce on Prevention Services did They used cost comparativeeffectiveness and when they looked at breast cancer they said it isnot cost effective to screen women before the age of 50 You know whatThey are right It is not cost effective But it certainly isclinically effective especially if your wife is the one who is 40 andhas breast cancer and it was found by a mammogramYou see judgment goes out the window What do we do We reversedthat finding one of the first things we did as we started the debateAre we going to do that every time the US Preventive Services TaskForce issues a ruling that is cost effective but not clinicallyeffective Are we going to do that every time the cost comparativeeffectiveness panel says You will do this and the American peoplesay That isnt right the American Cancer Society says That isntright Every time we get one of those rulings will we have to pass apiece of legislation to change itThe purpose of the three panels is well intended The MedicarePayment Advisory Commission is well intended Help us cut costs Butthe only way you go for cost is through prevention and management ofchronic disease You are not going to cut costs any other way because75 percent of everything we spend is on five chronic diseases Sounless you attack the real problem the real disease with our healthcare system you are not going to solve itThe lack of art in medicine will become readily apparent in 20152016 and 2017 We will see bureaucratic decisions in between a patientand their provider That is not a scare tactic That is absolute factWe have it now with Medicare It is there If I have a woman who is 55years of age today and I order bone density testing on her and find shehas severe osteoporosis I put her on medicine but am forbidden byMedicare to do the followup exam that is clinically necessary to see ifthe medicine is working and not only that under Medicare rules shecant even use her own money to buy that test So 2 years later we dothe test and we havent corrected her disease Now we change medicinesto try to find out but we cant find out again So she ultimatelyfalls and breaks her hip There is a 20percent mortality rate fromfalling and breaking ones hip But those are the rules we areoperating under now right now that you want to expandGovernment isnt ever compassionate It is never compassionatePeople are compassionate Thought hasto be in the middle of the practice of medicine not distant thoughtnear thought The very fact that an insurance company tells the doctorswhat they can and cannot do is no worse than what we are getting readyto do with the rest of governmentrun health care We didnt fix thatproblem We didnt address that problem with this We didnt guaranteethat you could walk with your feet We said Here is how much money youcan earn but we didnt address thatI will give two examples Two people I have taken care of for over 15years both had no clinical indications that they had anything wrong Icontacted the insurance company I thought they needed an MRI of thebrain Both of them were denied I got friends who are radiologists todo their MRI They both had brain tumors One is still alive What weare setting up isnt any different than what you have a complaint andgripe about now with the insurance industry You didnt fix that inthis bill There is no health care reform in this bill There is healthcoverage expansion but there is no reformOne of those people is still alive but had we followed eitherMedicare guidelines cost comparative effectiveness panel guidelineswhich would have forbidden doing an MRI that one person out of the twowould be dead today So as we sit here and look at our health caresystem my biggest worry is I will be in Medicare I will getrationed I know that The way we are going about it that is what isgoing to happen We are going to ration care We will not vote to notration it You know it is going to be rationed or you would have votedfor the amendment in committee that provided a prohibitionBut my real concern is not my generation My real concern is thosewho will follow us with 121 trillion worth of debt and the fact thatevery one of those is 25 years of age and younger today Twenty yearsfrom now they will be responsible for 1 million of both debt andunfunded liabilities for which we will have to collect on average70000 a year just to pay the interest on what we are sending themBefore they pay the rest of their income taxes before they pay payrolltaxes before they pay unemployment taxes before they send their kidsto school before they buy health insurance before they buy a homebefore they buy transportation the real worry that should be in frontof this country which is the No 1 issue on the publics mind is Howdo we get out of this financial mess That is the No 1 issue onpeoples minds It is not health careI have no hopes of convincing my colleagues that through 25 years ofpracticing medicine dealing with Medicare dealing with Medicaid thatthat is of any value to you Because we are hellbent on passing ahealth care bill and dealing to make sure we can and creatinginequities throughout this country and dividing our countryWe heard the Senator from Rhode Island characterize us as liarsbirthers supporters of the Aryan nation That is what I heard I satand listened to it I think he doth protest too much for he knows thatis not true There is nobody on our side of the aisle who cares anyless than anybody on the other side of the aisle about fixing healthcare The rub is you believe the government is the most powerful thingand the best way to do it We dont agree with that We actuallybelieve in the American people We actually believe in theentrepreneurial spirit of the average American making good decisionsfor themselves every day doing things we never do which isprioritizing where their money is going to go and how they are going tospend it and working like heck to advance the cause of their ownfamily their own freedom and their own liberty You dont believethat because if you did you would never put this kind of bill on thefloor This bill limits liberty This bill says you shallThink of the first big step in this bill In the United States youno longer have the ability to not buy health insurance If you have12 million in the bank and you want to put that at risk and say Idont want to you either have to pay a fine a tax or you have to buyhealth insurance So where is the liberty and where is the commerceclause in that and where does that tie in with individual liberty andindividual responsibility We say If you dont want to be responsiblethen we will make you responsible We dont say You have to suffer theconsequences of your lack of responsibilityWhat built this country was people figuring out if you dont actresponsibly it is going to cost you We are going to put a block onthat and say You dont have to act responsibly You dont have to actin your own best economic interest Dont worry We will take care ofitJefferson warned of that One of the Founders of this country warnedus against doing the very thing we are doing today If you read theFederalist Papers you will see what Madison wrote about the welfareclause and the commerce clause He said whenever the Senate starts tothink about claiming it means something different than it does here iswhat we want you to know It doesnt It is very limited in scopeI said yesterday in a press conference that this country is at thepoint of a crisis of confidence such as we have not seen in hundreds ofyears It is true Whether you are a very liberal individual or a veryconservative individual you dont have any confidence in us Thereason you dont is because we dont act in the countrys bestinterest We act in our political best interest Republicans areequally guilty We look at partisan issues rather than principledissues What we miss in all that is the best right thing for thecountry We are missing it with this bill We are missing the bestright thing for the country    Would the Senator yield for a question  If we are going to tax tanning salons why dont we taxanybody who goes to the beach Because true sunlight is much worse foryour skin than a tanning salon So if the intention was to preventdisease why wouldnt we tax it where most of the disease occurs Orhow about kids sports in the summer Lets tax kids baseball Orswimming Lets tax all the swimming pools because we have exposure toUV lightThis shows the precariousness and the silliness of a large portion ofthis and I yield back   President if in fact we got rid of 50 percent ofthe fraud in Medicare and Medicaid we would generate 600 billionevery 10 years more than offsetting the cuts that have been outlinedin this bill  How long have weknown and how long has Medicare been in trouble that we havent fixedit We will not fix it We will do exactly what the Senator says whatwe always do what we have done since I have been in this body We putthe credit card into the machine and say Transfer this to yourgrandkids We take no pain ourselves What is lacking in our countrytoday is moral character to lead on the basis of sacrifice It shouldstart with us as Senators in this bodyMr President I understand our time has expired President I thank the Chair and I look forward tohearing the remarks in the cloakroom of the chairman of the FinanceCommittee
S_TN_CORKER,2009-12-20, Will the Senator yield  I know hecares deeply about his patients and continues to treat patients as heserves in the Senate What he has done is pointed out the fact thatthere will be much interruption changes in the physicians andpatients relationship But the big picture is what the Senator isconcerned about too that is the tremendous indebtedness this countryhas by the fact thatthe good chairman of the Finance Committee ishere today listening patiently and I know this has to be painful tohimhalf the reform we are talking about is actually putting people inMedicaid a program that 40 percent of physicians will not see and 50percent of specialists will not see  Last weekend the New York Times talked about manyphysicians prescribing antipsychotic drugs to young people because theydont want to deal with them on Medicaid So half this reform is peoplegoing into this type of program and half the money is coming fromMedicare which is insolventWe have spent all this time all kinds of bipartisan meetings I knowyou spoke about the issue of partisanship I know the good chairman ishere We early on said we wanted to join in health care reform Wejust didnt want to take money from Medicare which was an insolventprogram to fund it What was the major building block of this programTaking 464 billion from Medicare to fund reform We were in essenceblocked out on the front end saying something we thought was the wrongtype of principle to build upon  So if I understand correctly of the new patients goinginto Medicaid 50 percent of the money comes from an insolvent programWe are not dealing with the doc fix Much of the savings they havetalked about is just like the doc fix that back in 1997 the AMA bothsides of the aisle agreed to do something to save money for MedicareAs the Senator knows now the Reid amendment takes out all the doc fixnow with a 285 billion gap over the next 10 years to deal withphysicians It is another example of how we dont have the courage Weput in place cuts We are not going to do that We know what damagethat will cause to patients In this particular case we should not dothat But the fact is many of these cuts that have been discussed willnever take place They will never take place At the end of the day Icome back to the very thing you talked about that is we have 12trillion in debt 386 trillion in unfundedliabilities for Medicare alone and here we are passing a bill that isusing up the resources we might otherwise use to make it solventInstead of doing that we are leveraging a whole new entitlement Iheard some of the pundits this morning parroting some of the things Ihave heard from my friends on the other side of the aisle Lets passthis bill We know it is not very good but we will fix it as we movealongWhat I fear is the way we are going to fix it we are going to fix itby adding tremendous debt on future generations My guess is over thenext very short period2 or 3 monthsthe other side of the aisle isgoing to come right back up here with a huge several hundred billiondollar unpaid bill to deal with one of these issues we have beentalking about That is the way business is done here

changed their vote fromaye to noMessrs PAUL BAIRD GUTIERREZ JOHNSON of Georgia LYNCH ACKERMANMs DeGETTE and Mrs NAPOLITANO changed their vote from no toayeSo the amendment was rejectedThe result of the vote was announced as above recordedBy unanimous consent Mr Hoyer was allowed to speak out of orderWelcoming Our Armed Forces Let me say to the gentleman from Tennessee let me explain thepurpose behind the provision which your amendment seeks to strike AndI say that I would be glad to work with the chairman and with theMember at this time striking the provision that I inserted in thecommittee that you objected to and wont ask for a recorded voteSo let me explain the background behind this amendment and I thinkif we can all work together I think we can make investors safer andmake a better systemIf the body will recall and the chairman on December 12 of lastyear about a year ago Bernie Madoff was arrested for committing thelargest financial fraud in the history of the country It was atremendous scama 65 million Ponzi scheme which defrauded nonprofitsuniversities and pension funds and wiped out the savings of literallytens of thousands of families and citizensNow to do this Bernie Madoff operated two separate entities onewas a broker dealer and one was an investment adviser The fraudoccurred with the investor adviser That is where the fraud occurredThe investment adviser was registered with the SEC The investmentadviser Madoffs investor adviser was subject to examination by theSEC but I would point out to the chairman of the full committee andthe gentleman from Tennessee they never examined the investor adviserThey never examined itMadoff operated a brokerdealer in the same premises and under thesame name And it was examined was subject to examination by the SECand by FINRA I was saying let FINRA go ahead and examine theinvestment advisers these dual operations where you have both FINRAinspected the brokerdealer at least every other year but the frauddidnt occur there it occurred in the investment adviserFINRA lacked the authority to go in and examine the investor adviserThey couldnt examine it And my provision I put in the committee saidlet them be able to as they examine the brokerdealer let them go inand look at the books of the investment adviser if youre operating adual operation Had they had the right they would have gone in andthey would have discovered this fraud The SEC which had the rightnever did itNow as I said earlier maybe theres another solution The SEC hassaid we dont want FINRA taking over our jurisdiction What Id like tosay is lets make sure the SEC starts doing their job Lets make surethat they start examining these investment advisers Someone needs toThe average investment adviser is only examined once every 10 yearsBernie Madoffs investment adviser was never examined Its the kind ofgap in regulation that causes disasters It causes scams it causesBernie Madoffs of the world to get along for decadesThat is why I introduced this amendment the provision which werenow strikingNow going forward we at least need to look at this We need to knowthat there are 500 or 600 of these investment advisers and brokerdealers dual operations And we need to make clear that the SECsomewhere that they have the authority to examine both investmentadvisers and brokerdealers If they want to perform that missionandI know one thing the chairman has done he has added more money for theSEC I think that is part of the answer but I think this committeethe Congress as we go forward needs to make sure they do their jobAnd there was a monumental failure of the SEC and if they dont dotheir job or we find they dont and they have the resources lets giveit to someone elseI yield back the remainder of my time  Will the gentleman yield I appreciate that and I think that is a logical solutionto that And at this time I will support the gentlemans amendment tostrike the provision And as I said when I brought this provision up Iwanted to highlight the fact that this is how Bernie Madoff you knowhe got away with operating these two operations on the same premisesand we need to do thethe regulators need to do a better job someoneof being able to look across those operations  Madam Chair I have an amendment at the desk made inorder under the ruleThe Acting CHAIR The Clerk will designate the amendmentThe text

Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2010which is the last appropriations bill for this fiscal yearThe conference agreement on HR 3326 provides over 363 billiontowards protecting our troops abroad and taking better care of theirfamilies at home To help protect our troops this bill providesincreased funding for the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle Fundand for the procurement of new Humvees and of new heavy and mediumtactical vehicles This is particularly important given the casualtyrate and the difficulties our soldiers are experiencing in AfghanistanHR 3326 increases pay for all servicemembers by 34 percent and itfully funds the requested end strength levels for active reserve andselected reserve personnel The bill provides over 29 billion for topoftheline medical care including 120 million for traumatic braininjury and psychological health and it increases funding for thewounded the ill and injured warrior programsThe conference agreement also includes over 472 million for familyadvocacy programs and it fully funds the family support and yellowribbon programs The bill also includes 20 million for the ArmyNational Guard family assistance centers and reintegration programsbut this bill cannot provide for the common defense without a commoneffortIn my home State of Maine there are men and women who work every dayto help in this effort The funding in this bill would have been wastedif it werent for the efforts of the welders designers and metalworkers of the Bath Ironworks of the skilled factory workers andassembly men at Vintech in Biddeford Maine of the worldclassmachinists and engineers at Pratt and Whitney in North Berwick or ofthe dedicated laborers and nuclear engineers at the Portsmouth NavalShipyardThis is a clear example of why the bills before us today are sointerconnected Our economic security and our national security areinextricably linked and our economic security is still in direstraitsMadam Speaker if you were sitting at a boardroom table on WallStreet today you might hear the employees with Goldman Sachsdiscussing their 1 billion in profits or bonuses or you might hearemployees of Citibank discussing raises for their top executives Youmight also hear that the stock market has gone up 60 percent since thespring You might even hear terms like economic recovery orrebound So if you are sitting at that boardroom table on WallStreet you might think that the economy has fully bounced back andthat we are out of the woods You may start to believe that there isnothing but smooth sailing aheadYet if you were at a kitchen table on Main Street in my home Stateof Maine you would hear a very different story Rather than talk oflarge profits you would hear families discussing a savings accountthat has all but disappeared Instead of listening to talk of raises orbonuses you would hear families debating cutbacks on food or cutbackson health care Instead of hearing phrases like economic recoveryor rebound you would hear terms like high unemployment andmounting debtFor the big banks on Wall Street the economic recovery may be athand but for the millions of unemployed workers and for the thousandsof small businesses that are struggling to get by the economicrecovery is still a long way off In my State and all across thecountry there are millions of Americans who want to get back to workbut they need us to lend the same helping hand that we gave to WallStreet in its time of needMadam Speaker the rule before us today allows for the considerationof the Jobs for Main Street Act which will move us down that roadThis legislation invests in our Nations infrastructure and it putsmore Americans back to work by providing 48 billion to rebuild andrepair our national transportation system This investment provides ameasurable return not only by creating and preserving jobs but byliterally building the foundation for a longterm economic recoveryThis bill will also preserve the jobs of teachers of police officersand of firefighters For those who have already lost their jobs theJobs Act extends unemployment benefits for 2 months and it maintainsthe current COBRA subsidyThese programsthese investments the economic lifelineshave areal impact Just this week I heard from a constituent of mine whosaid these words Something needs to be done There are less than 4weeks left for my husbands unemployment After that we wont be ableto pay the rent and we will be out on the streets with a child under 2years old Every day I wonder what is going to happen next and I evenhave nightmares You bail out these large banks which then only raiseour interest rates and lower our credit linesand for what Thatdoesnt help the little guy like us Do something to help usMadam Speaker we have the opportunity and we have the obligation totake the bailout money that was used as a lifeline to Wall Street andto give that money back to the American people and to those who havebeen hit the hardest by these tough economic times The COBRA subsidywe passed this spring began expiring a few weeks ago If we dont actnow it will completely disappear by January 1 In my State fullpayment for COBRA uses up nearly 90 percent of the average unemploymentbenefits That means outofwork Mainers end up with only about 150 amonth left after paying the full cost of their health insuranceWe need to act now and we need to act fast to ensure that MainStreet recovers If we do not act we will have only assured that WallStreet keepstheir bonuses while American families lose their benefits We will haveonly watched Wall Street get rid of their debt while watching smallbusinesses take on moreMadam Speaker we have already put more than enough into shoring upWall Street Now we need to focus on creating jobs for the averageAmerican that will rebuild our economy from the bottom upI reserve the balance of my time  Madam Speaker I yield 3 minutes to thegentleman from New York a member of the Committee on Rules

Unemployment BenefitsCOBRA and FMAP which is health care funding for our States and thechild care tax credit These are measures that we must pass to build afoundation for longterm economic recoveryThis is not an ordinary day and given the importance of thislegislation I hope Members on both sides of the aisle will supportthis rule so that we can move quickly to enact these criticallyimportant measuresI wish as so many of my colleagues wish that we werent faced withsuch difficult problems I wish that when the Democrats took over themajority we werent saddled with two wars a recession and a 13trillion deficit But wishing wont make these problems go away Thereis real urgency in the actions before us today and I truly hope thatmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle

urge my colleagues to support this rule and allow us tomove forward on the debate to complete the work that we were sent hereto doI reserve the balance of my time  My good friend from North Carolina hassuggested that this isnt an emergency I would say that I hear everyday from constituents in my district who feel that we are in a time ofemergency In Maine we have 20000 unemployed workers who are facingthe end of their unemployment benefits A very critical thing that weare about to talk about today is the extension of unemploymentbenefitsNow we are anxious for the economy to improve but the fact is in myState unemployment benefits are the fourth largest payroll That is atragedy that we have to deal with We have to make sure that thosepeople in the middle of a cold winter dont go without their vitalsupport and that our State doesnt go without a critical part of oureconomyMany of those people cant even stand a delay because the fact is ifthey go for even a few days or weeks without their benefits theyvealready hit the end of their credit card limits theyve already goneas far as they can possibly go Many workers have talked to me aboutthe fact that they are using their COBRA subsidy they were laid offand the fact is this extended that as wellAs far as Im concerned there are many critical things in this billThis is the time to get it passed People say to me all the time Whenare you going to get something done in Washington As far as Imconcerned this is something we have to get done and we need to getback to work todayI reserve the balance of my time  Madam Speaker I

werevery different erasI just want to remind my colleagues on the floor that we are here atthe end of the Bush administration When President Obama came tooffice yes the Democrats had been here for 2 years before and therewere things that we were unable to fix when we were simply in themajority The fact is that President Obama and this particularCongressand I came here as a freshmaninherited the worst recessionsince the Great Depression two wars that werent paid for a brokenhealth care system and a 1950s energy policy That is what we have hadto deal with As my colleagues know this has not been an easy year Weare here over and over again attempting to deal with thisI yield 1 minute to my colleague from Colorado Mr Perlmutter  Thank you to my colleague from North Carolinafor her thoughts While we dont always agree I appreciate herreminding us about the soldiers who have fallen about their familiesabout her visit to Arlington CemeteryI want to concur I had the privilege of visiting the cemetery myselfthis week Not only did I also grieve for those families who were therevisiting the gravestones of their loved ones and their family membersand many who were just there to think about the people who they didnteven know who served for usI was also tremendously proud to see the thousands of wreaths thatdecorated those graves that had been brought down from my home Statethe State of Maine in honor of our fallen soldiers There were 16000that were brought to Arlington Cemetery and there were many people whotraveled with them to make sure that we show the proper respect for ourmilitary for our soldiers and for those who served their country inthe past and virtually every dayI want to just say that we are here today in part to talk aboutmaking sure that there is adequate funding for our military Yes weall wish that our colleagues in the Senate had acted faster on thisbill that we werent dealing with continuing resolutions but this isthe particular situation that we are in It is very important that wefinish our work before the end of the year before the end of theholidays that we recognize our soldiers our current military andmany of the other needs in this bill many of which will be discussedas soon as we finish the debate on this sameday ruleMadam Speaker in closing I just want to say that the rule before usthis morning simply allows the consideration of

shall notify the Membersof the House and the Senate respectively to reassemble atsuch place and time as they may designate if in theiropinion the public interest shall warrant it  Madam Speaker before I yield to one of mycolleagues I do want to mention one point of concern I have in thebillThe conference agreement on HR 3326 is the first step towardscutting wasteful defense spending but it is by no means perfect It isno means the last step that we must take The conference agreementprovides 465 million for the development of an alternative engine forthe F35 Joint Strike Fighter This provision represents businesses asusual in Washington for providing funds for an engine thats alreadybeing built and already being built wellThere is no need to devote our precious Federal dollars to a wastefulalternative engine program at this time when Americans are strugglingto find jobs to pay their medical bills and to put food on the tableEvery defense bill that we spend wisely contributes to our nationalsecurity and every defense dollar that we waste hampers our economicsecurityMadam Speaker I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman fromIllinois Mr Hare  Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to thegentleman from Washington Mr Dicks a member of the Committee onAppropriations  Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to thegentleman from Washington Mr Dicks  Madam Speaker I yield 3 minutes to thegentlewoman from Texas Ms JacksonLeeMs JACKSONLEE of Texas Let me thank the distinguished gentleladyfrom MaineMadam Speaker I wish to start by wishing America a very MerryChristmas and to many other Americans a happy holiday And Id liketo give my thanks to the Rules Committee and the staff of the RulesCommittee for doing an enormous job Our chairwoman Louise Slaughterhas been at the forefront of the major successes we have had on behalfof the American people I offer my appreciation as well for ChairmanJohn Murtha who in his astuteness and commitment to the men and womenof the United States military finds many of us today supporting theDefense appropriations bill even as we begin to consider the nextsteps in AfghanistanBut why am I standing here today to be able to speak to my colleaguesand the American people One because history gets distorted We are inthis predicament because the last administration of Republicanleadership took away our surplus that had been created in the 1990sThey dashed and dashed and destroyed and devastated Isnt itinteresting that youd come now to complain about a leadershipPresident and Democratic leadership in Congress that have had to makethe political sacrifice to ensure that Americans can workAnd so let me just set the record straight The American Recovery andReinvestment Actthat secured no Republican votescreated 35 millionjobs and gave 95 percent of American workers a tax cut And today aswe speak we are cutting the job loss every single month Why Imstanding here today is because Im enthusiastically supporting thisrule because we will then pass a jobs bill and I will be able to gohome to those in the 18th Congressional District who told me over theThanksgiving holiday as I was participating in feeding those onThanksgiving Day I lost my job from a major corporation Well Imgoing to tell them that because of infrastructure funding 48 billionin fact that we will be able to invest in highways and mass transitOne billion dollars in Federal investments to highways creates 27800jobs Is there something wrong with that The wrongness of it is thatthe other side is not thinking about the American people and has nothad a good thought about how to invest in AmericaThis jobs bill is going to keep States from cutting teachers andpolice and firefighters and its going to provide job training I amproud that they have taken my ideas and many of our ideas but workthat I have done on summer youth jobs Theyre going to put 150000people in job training positions One of the ideas that can beincorporated that I have put forward in a bill is to make sure thatpeople can keep their unemployment while they are in a job training andreceive a stipend Dignity jobs is what were talking aboutMs JACKSONLEE of Texas And then my small business friends onceand for all well answer your question about getting loans But the bigthing is Riverside General Hospital because of the astuteness ofthose who worked on the Defense bill will get 1 million for the firsttime an African American hospital to help our soldiers with posttraumatic stress disorder I have worked on this for 4 years Its acelebration Merry Christmas to America  Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to thegentleman from Maryland Mr Cummings  Madam Speaker I rise to discuss at least onething my colleague and friend from North Carolina mentioned Im aNortherner so I cant claim to be an expert on crocodiles but Iassume that when youre talking about crocodile tears youre talkingabout being insincere and I want to say I receive letters from myconstituents every day about the urgency of what we are doing todayAnd I have to say that like it or not I cannot get through the pile ofletters without crying tears for real Its very very difficult tothink about the small businesses laidoff individuals individualsworrying about their jobs what theyre going through in my districtand the urgency with which they view the actions that we are about totake today and the importance of moving on from this rule and gettingto the actual debateI want to read one of them that is in front of me here before I yielda little time to my colleague from CaliforniaThis one says My housemate and I were both laid off me inSeptember 08 and she in February 09 We have applied diligently forwork in and around Portland with no luck We had to cash in our meager401ks and have been very thankful for the COBRA subsidy so that wecould afford insurance during this most harsh of times But our moneyis running out fastAs you know the subsidy is about to expire and we cannot affordthe huge jump in premium We cannot afford both the mortgage and theinsurance We cannot afford our prescriptions and our health care willbe at stake as if things werent bad enough We will lose our homePLEASE help push through the COBRA extension and continuation ofthe ARRA COBRA subsidy It is an immediate fix for so many families whowill surely gain employment over the next 6 months now that the economyhas finally taken an upswingMadam Speaker those are the things that make us all cry real tearsand make us want to pass this rule and go on to passing thislegislation todayMadam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from CaliforniaMr Garamendi  Madam Speaker the legislation we areconsidering today is about investing in jobs It is about investing ininfrastructure and it is about rebalancing our economy So its notjust the big banks and Wall Street firms that benefit from an economicrecovery This bill is about helping the American familyThis week a New York TimesCBS News poll surveyed unemployedAmericans Not surprisingly they found that being unemployed takes atoll far beyond what can be measured in dollars and cents Half of thepeople surveyed said they had begun to suffer from depression andanxiety half said the recession has caused them to make major lifechanges and nearly half said they have seen changes in theirchildrens behavior that they know is a result of their difficultfinancial situationWe are not just helping men and women whove lost their job who havesuffered from uncertainty emotional pain and indignation but we arehelping their families We are helping their children It is time forus to invest in the jobs and policies that will get the American Dreamback on track and restore the promise of opportunity and prosperity foreveryoneI urge a yes vote on the previous question and on the ruleThe material previously referred to by Ms Foxx is as followsAmendment to H Res 976Offered by Ms FoxxAt the end of the

S_MD_MIKULSKI,2009-12-03, Madam President I yield 312 minutes to the juniorSenator from Minnesota Mr FrankenThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Minnesota isrecognized  Madam President how much time does our side haveThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore There is 17 minutes 15 secondsremainingThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Michigan  I want to hear about theamendment and continue our conversation  I ask unanimous consent she be extended an additional 2minutes No I withdraw that request The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Without objection it is soordered Healthcare reform is a mustdo womans issue and health insurance reform isa mustchange issueSo many of the women and men of the Senate are here today to fightfor change and to make sure we have universal access to health careWhen we have universal access it makes a difference in our liveswhich means we have to have universal access to preventive andscreening servicesMy amendmentand by the way it is a bipartisan amendmentmakesuniversal access to preventive and screening services for womenavailableThere is much discussion about whether women should get a particularservice at a particular age We dont mandate that women get a servicewe leave that up to a decision made with the woman and her doctor Butfirst of all they need to be able to have a doctor So we are foruniversal access and this is why the underlying bill is so importantThen when you have that there should also be universal access topreventive and screening services particularly to the top killers ofwomen those things that are unique to women We think about cancerbreast cancer ovarian cancer and cervical cancer Also women aredying at an increased rate of lung cancer Then there are these othersilent killers that have had a lethal effect on women and that iscardio and vascular disease So we want to guarantee universal accessto medically appropriate or medically necessary screening andpreventive servicesMany women dont get these services because first of all they donthave health insurance and No 2 when they do have it it means theseservices are either not available unless they are mandated by States orthe copayments are so high that they avoid getting them in the firstplaceThe second important point about my amendment is it eliminatesdeductibles and copayments So we eliminate two big hurdles havinginsurance in the first place which is the underlying bill as well ascopayments and deductibles I know of no one in this room who would notwant to be on our side on this issueI wish to acknowledge the role the Senator from Alaska has playedMs Murkowski as well as Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison Senator Snoweand Senator Collins We the women of the Senate have worked on abipartisan basis for years making sure we were included in theprotocols at NIH increasing funding for important research areas tofind that cure to race for that cure and at the same time to be ableto have mammogram standards What the Murkowski amendmentand by theway she is Murkowski I am Mikulski We sound alike and theamendments might sound alike but boy are they differentThe Murkowski amendment offers information I think that isimportant That is a threshold matter You have to have information tomake an informed decision But it does not guarantee universal accessto these services and of course it does not eliminate the highpayments and deductibles So her amendment is flawed My amendment isterrific My amendment offers key preventive services including anannual womens health screening that would go to a comprehensiveassessment of the dangers to women including heart disease anddiabetesWe hope when the Senate makes its decision today it deals with thefact that for we women the insurance companies take simply being awoman as a preexisting condition We face so many issues and hurdlesWe cant get health care We cant get health insurance because ofpreexisting conditions called a CsectionI am going to be meeting with an insurance company executive laterwhere his company denied health insurance to a woman who had amedically mandated Csection and a letter from this insurance companysaid We are not going to give you insurance unless you have asterilizationa coerced sterilization in the United States of AmericaThat is going to be an amendment for another day But I just wish togive the flavor and the power of what women face when we have to copewith the insurance companies or where there are barriers to our gettingthese health care screening servicesSo we want to be able to save lives and we want to be able to savemoney We believe in universal access and if you utilize the serviceit is because you have had the consultation with your doctor We doknow early screening and detection does save lives and at the sametime it saves moneyI will conclude with this When we look at heart disease anddiabetes not only cancer but early detection of diabetes means in awellmanaged program under appropriate medical supervision you verylikely will not lose that eye you will not lose that kidney you willnot lose that leg and most of all you will not lose your lifeSo lets not lose the Mikulski amendment Lets go with Mikulski andthank Murkowski for her information but hers is too tepid and toolimitedMadam President I ask my colleague one of the great guys whosupports us Senator Cardin how much time he needsI yield 5 minutes to Senator Cardin  Madam President I yield 4 minutes to the Senator fromthe State of Washington who has been a real leader on these issuesBy the way Madam President before the Senator speaks I want tothank Senator Stabenow for a unique courtesy This is her desk and asmany of my colleagues know I broke my ankle and I cant get up towhere my desk is at this point I will however in a matter of anotherfew weeks But she has given me this desk on loan so that I could standon my own two feet to debate this amendment and I wanted to thank herfor the courtesyMadam President I also want to note something while the seniorSenator from the Republican leadership is here and the author of theamendment We the women of the Senate on a bipartisan basis haveworked for womens health Today we disagree on what is the best wayto achieve it by these two amendments I want to thank my colleaguesfor setting a tone of civility I think this has been one of the mostrational civilized conversations we have had over this and I wouldlike to thank themAs the leader on this side of the aisle in terms of seniority Iwould like to extend my hand in friendship and suggest when this billis done and this amendment is done we continue to focus on thiswonderful work that we have done together We have done things thathave saved millions of lives and so I look forward to continuing thatMadam President I now yield 4 minutes to the Senator from the Stateof Washington Mrs MurrayThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Washington     This amendment does not coverabortion Abortion has never been defined as a preventive service Thisamendment is strictly concerned with ensuring that women get the kindof preventive screenings and treatments they may need to preventdiseases particular to women such as breast cancer and cervical cancerThere is neither legislative intent nor legislative language that wouldcover abortion under this amendment nor would abortion coverage bemandated in any way by the Secretary of Health and Human Services  President we are waiting for Senator Boxer to cometo the floor so if the other side of the aisle has another speaker Iknow at the end we hope that Senator Lisa and Senator BarbI say thatbecause our last names sound so much the samecould wrap it upHow would the Senator from Wyoming like to proceed We are waitingfor Senator Boxer or for Senator Baucus   Whatever way it will work and accommodate you while weare waiting to see who our speakers are  President I fear the microphone of the Senatorfrom Alaska is not working  President how much time is there on our sideAs we get ready to conclude the debate on both the Mikulski as inBarbara Mikulski and Murkowski as in Lisa Murkowski amendments I wantto first say a word about the Senator from Alaska We have workedtogether on the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee Wehave worked together as women of the Senate to provide access towomens health services Not too long ago when I had my awful fallshe gave me much wisdom and counsel and practical tips because sheherself had broken her ankle To us when you say to Senator Lisa orSenator Barb Break a leg it has a whole different meaning Iagain thank her for all her work I have great respect for her I lookforward to our continued working togetherBut I do sincerely disagree with her amendment because what heramendment does is it guarantees really only information It does notguarantee universal access to preventive and screening servicesIt also does not remove the cost barriers by eliminating the highdeductibles for the copayments when you go to get a preventative orscreening service It tells insurance companies to give information onrecommended preventative care That is a good thing but it is athreshold thing You need to have universal access to the serviceIn addition we do not mandate that you have the service we mandatethat you have access to the service The decision as to whether youshould get it will be a private one unique to you We leave it topersonalized medicine So in the poignant case of the wife of theSenator from Wyoming it would have been up to the doctor thephysician to get her the service she neededIt is not only I or one side of the aisle that is opposing theMurkowski amendment The American Cancer Society the American HeartAssociation and the American academy of GYN services oppose itMy amendment is a superior amendment because it guarantees universalaccess to preventative and screening services It also eliminates oneof the major barriers to accessing care by getting rid of high paymentsand deductibles It doesnt say you will have a mammogram at 40because again we are substituting ourselves for the task force itsays you will have universal access to that mammogram if you and yourdoctor decide it is medically necessary or medically appropriateVote for Mikulski Dont vote for Murkowski And please on this oneget it straight President I rise in opposition to the LisaMurkowski amendment Though wellintentioned it does not guaranteeuniversal access to preventive and screening services for women Itdoes not remove the cost barriers of high payments and codeductiblesIt is opposed by the American Cancer Society and the American HeartAssociation It primarily provides information on those mattersWe salute her intention but we think her amendment is too limitedand to quote the American Heart Association it would be an actualstep backwards in the area of making preventive services availableparticularly not only in the matter of cancer but in heart and vasculardiseasethe emerging No 1 killer for womenI urge defeat of the Murkowski amendment
S_MN_FRANKEN,2009-12-03, Madam President I rise to express my support forSenator Mikulskis amendment for womens healthThis amendment is crucial because it is about prevention Preventionis one of the key ways this bill will transform our system of sick careinto true health care It is common sense You get the right screeningsat the right time so you find diseases earlier It saves lives and itsaves moneyThe Senate bill already has several provisions for preventive carewhich I strongly support For example colonoscopies and screening forheart disease will be covered at no cost It is a good startThe current bill relies solely on the US Preventive Services TaskForce to determine which services will be covered at no cost Theproblem is several crucial womens health services are omittedSenator Mikulskis amendment closes this gap Under her amendment theHealth Resources and Services Administration will be able to includeother important services at no cost such as the well woman visitprenatal care and family planningThese preventive services will truly improve womens health Forexample if all women got the recommended screening for cervicalcancer we could detect this disease earlier and prevent four out ofevery five cases of this invasive cancer This will improve the healthof our mothers sisters and our daughters This bill and thisamendment will make prevention a priority and not an afterthoughtAlthough I respect the efforts of my distinguished colleague fromAlaska the Murkowski alternative falls short The Murkowski amendmentdoes nothing to guarantee women will have improved access to coverageand costsharing protections for preventive services Rather thanestablish objective scientific standards about which preventiveservices should be covered this alternative only requires insurers toconsult with medical organizations when making coverage decisionsWhile we know the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendationsdo not cover all necessary services the Murkowski amendment entirelyremoves even this basic coverage requirement from the bill leavingwomen without any protections under health care reform for essentialpreventive care This means that important preventive care for womenincluding screening for osteoporosis and sexually transmittedinfections may not be covered by insurance plansIn the simplest terms the Murkowski amendment maintains the statusquo and we know the status quo is not working for millions of womenwho are forgoing preventive care because they simply cannot afford itThe Murkowski amendment continues to leave prevention coveragedecisions up to health insurance companies and that means there wouldbe no guaranteethat any health plan will cover basic preventive services at allDo we want to leave these important decisions up to the insurancecompanies The health of American women is too important to leave intheir hands That is why I urge my colleagues to support SenatorMikulskis amendment and vote to make sure women can get the preventivescreenings they need to stay healthy Most important this amendmentwill make sure women have access to these lifesaving screenings at nocostThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senators time has expiredThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Without objection it is soordered Madam President prevention is just one of the ways thisbill will improve womens health It also ends insurance companiespractice of charging women more because they happen to be women ordenying coverage based on a history of pregnancy Csection ordomestic violenceWe need to pass this bill this year to ensure comprehensiveaffordable care for women throughout the country And we need toinclude this amendment because I want to be able to look my wife in theeye I want to be able to look my daughter in the eyemy son tooandmy future grandchildren in the eye and say we did everything we couldin this bill to improve womens health We cannot wait any longer Iurge all my colleagues to stand with us and support this amendmentI yield the floor
S_WY_ENZI,2009-12-03, Madam President I yield 5 minutes to the Senator fromOklahomaThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Oklahoma  Madam President I yield 5 minutes to the Senator fromTexasThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Texas  Madam President I yield 10 minutes to the Senator fromFloridaThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from FloridaMr LeMIEUX Madam President I come to the floor today to draw backthe curtain a little I hope and to widen the lens to talk about theissue of the bill before us not just on this particular amendment buton what it is going to mean for my constituents in Florida and for thepeople of this countryI had the opportunity last week to be back home in Florida in southFlorida in Palm Beach County and Broward County and MiamiDade Countywhere I talked to doctors hospital administrators folks who runMedicare Advantage plans as well as everyday Floridians specificallysenior citizens The responses I heard were nearly unanimous and thatwas grave concern about the bill that is being debated on this floorand a general confusion as to why the Congress is pursuing the paththat it is The people of Florida do not understand why we are going tocut Medicare to create a new program The people of Florida do notunderstand why we are going to raise taxes to create a new program Thepeople whom I have spoken to in Florida do not understand why we wouldundertake a new 25 trillion health care proposal if it was not goingto reduce the cost of health insurance for the 170 million to 180million Americans who have health insurance todayWhy are we embarking upon this measure if it is not going to affectmost everyday Floridians and everyday Americans who are strugglingunder the high cost of health insurance Health insurance premiums haveincreased 130 percent in the past 10 yearsWhen the President put this proposal forward and when he campaignedon it he said his major goal was to reduce the cost of healthinsurance When he addressed the Nation in a joint session of Congresson September 9 he said his plan would reduce the cost of healthinsurance But we find out that for at least 32 million Americans itwill raise the cost of health insurance 10 to 13 percent So at leasthalf of the goal if not most of the goal of his plan for mostAmericans in this country will not be accomplished Yet we are going tocut nearly 12 trillion out of Medicare we are going to raise taxesby 12 trillion and we are going to spend 25 trillion on thisprogram which was admitted to by Senator Baucus yesterday on thefloor which cannot be under my understanding in any way budgetneutralBut I want to speak specifically about the cuts to Medicare It cuts192 billion according to the Congressional Budget Office toMedicares payment rates for most services I think we have to beclear here that if you cut providers you are going to cut servicesThe very reason we talked about increasing doctor payments in that 14 trillion program was so that patients would not receive fewerservices so there would be ample doctors providing services forMedicare It is beyond logic to argue that cutting providers will notcut services What will happen when we cut providers doctors nursinghomes home health agencies hospitals Fewer and fewer of them willprovide benefits and fewer and fewer of them will take MedicareThe Chief Actuary of CMS believes the cuts in the bill we have beforeus could cause providers to end their participation in Medicare   providers for whom Medicare constitutes a substantiveportion of their business could find it difficult to remainprofitable and might end their participation in the programEvery American understands this If we pay less money to health careproviders they are going to offer less benefits or more and more theyare not going to participate in MedicareThe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission found in June of last yearthat 29 percent of Medicare beneficiaries who were looking for aprimary care doctor had a problem finding one to treat them This is ofgrave concern to the 3 million Floridians who are on Medicare If adoctor will not see them what kind of health care plan is this Theseseniors our greatest generation have paid into this program theirwhole life It is illusory if they cant find a doctor who will treatthemOne of my constituents Earl Bean from Sanford FL recently toldCNN that he called about 15 doctors when he was trying to find healthcare and he was told they were not taking new Medicare patients Sowhen we cut 12 trillion out of Medicare is that going to improvehealth care for seniors or is it going to continue to decline healthcare for seniors You cant get blood from a stone It is going to makethe situation worse For anyone to come to this floor and say that itwould not is incredibleWe have in Florida the second highest Medicare population When wecut 135 billion from hospitals and 21 billion from thedisproportionate share fund which is basically money that goes tothese hospitals to provide health care for seniors and the indigenthow are they going to be able to provide that health care I spoke tothe administrator of the North Broward Hospital District and told himabout this cut to the DSH funds and he told me it would be devastatingto their provision of health careThen we are going to take a very popular program called MedicareAdvantagemore than 900000 Floridians in my Stateand we are goingto cut it as well I recently visited the Leon Medical Center and theirnew facility in Miami Dade County where they provide stateoftheartfirstclass health care for seniors not only normal health care buteyeglasses hearing aids dental care and the constituents who gothere love it They are getting the kind of health care that you wouldhope your senior citizens in your family would getThe principal of the company Ben Leon told me they have saved 70billion in the way they have run their system He told me if wecontinue on this path with these cuts to Medicare Advantage he willnot be able to providethese good services going forward There are some fixes to grandfatherfolks in but all in all people will be cut and all in all the programwill not be as good and it will decline the health care of seniors inFlorida and across this countryWe will cut 15 billion from nursing home care and 40 billion fromhome health agencies I spoke to a provider of a home health agencypractice in Florida He said these cuts will put half of the homehealth care agency folks out of business At a time when we have 112percent unemployment in Florida this health care bill is going to costpeople their jobs and it is going to decline the quality of healthcareI am also concerned about this Medicare advisory board Thisindependent board of nonelected folks is going to have the power to cutMedicare by 23 billion over the next 10 years and it will be up tothis body to reinstate those cuts These people are not elected myconstituents in Florida dont know who they are but they are going tobe responsible for the decline of their Medicare and their health careThe greatest generation who fought to protect this country islooking at this health care bill and wondering why Folks with healthinsurance in this countrymore than 170 million who are not going tosee their health care costs go down but upare wondering whyAmericans who are seeing higher taxes and penalties for not buyingthese health insurance programs under this bill are wondering whyIf we are here to reform health careand we should beif we arehere to try to make sure the 45 million people in this country and thenearly 4 million Floridians get health insuranceand we should bethen why dont we take a stepbystep approachI am new to this body My first day here was September 10 so I havenot even been here 3 months But I can tell my colleagues the Americanpeople if they knew what I know now and could see what I see would bebaffled by this process There is not a giveandtake on this issue Wedidnt all sit down together in a conference room and work this out tohave a bipartisan bill The Democratic leader worked on it with hiscolleagues but not with usSo now we have a program that cuts Medicare that raises taxes thatdoesnt decrease the cost of health care for the majority of Americansand will cost us 25 trillion and cant be budgetneutral at a timewhen we have a 12 trillion debt a debt that requires each of useachfamilyto put 100000 on our shoulders to be responsible for thatdebt a debt where the third largest payment in our budget is forinterest payments and over the next 10 years those interest paymentswill go up by 500 billion enough to pay for many of the budgets ofthe Federal GovernmentThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator has used his 10minutesMr LeMIEUX Including the wars in Afghanistan and IraqI thank the Chair and I yield the floorThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Maryland isrecognized  Madam President I yield 10 minutes to the Senator fromSouth DakotaThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from South Dakota isrecognized  I appreciate the comments some of which need correctionfrom yesterday and those that have just been madeOn a partisan bill I sat through all of those days in the HELPCommittee That bill was rushed and put together Senator Kennedy wasnot able to be involved in that part of it His staff did it They didit in a hurry We turned in 159 amendments that were accepted Most ofthose were for typos and minor corrections There were a few thatactually had some substance to them That bill was passed on July 15out of committee without a single Republican vote It wasnt publishedWe didnt see the final version until September 17 The ones that werereally something that could have made a difference were taken outwithout the permission of any Republican Senator That is notbipartisanWe talked about how many hours we spent together If you dont acceptthings from the minority party it is not bipartisan It is stillpartisan Just spending hours doesnt make any differenceTo move on to a different topic yesterday we were talking aboutcosts I hope the people take a look at a Wall Street Journal articlefrom yesterday that saysA bill that raises prices but lowers costs and othermiraclesWe heard all day yesterday that this bill is going to save people alot of money This article readsWe have now reached the stage of the healthcare debatewhen all that matters is getting a bill passed so all newsis good news more subsidies mean lower deficits and moreexpensive insurance is really cheaper insurance Thenonpolitical mind reelsConsider how Washington received the Congressional BudgetOffices study Monday of how Harry Reids Senate bill willaffect insurance costs which by any rational measure oughtto have been a disaster for the billCBO found that premiums in the individual market will riseby 10 to 13 more than if Congress did nothing Familypolicies under the status quo are projected to cost 13100on average but under ObamaCare will jump to 15200Fabulous news No Big Cost Rise in US Premiums Is Seen inStudy said the New York Times while the Washington Postdeclared Senate Health Bill Gets a Boost The WhiteHouse crowed that the CBO report was more good news aboutwhat reform will mean for families struggling to keep up withskyrocketing premiums under the broken status quo FinanceChairman Max Baucus chimed in from the Senate floor thatHealthcare reform is fundamentally about lower healthcarecosts Lowering costs is what healthcare reform is designedto do lowering costs and it will achieve this objectiveExcept it wont CBO says it expects employersponsoredinsurance costs to remain roughly in line with the statusquo yet even this is a failure by Mr Baucuss and the WhiteHouses own standardsMeanwhile fixing the individual marketwhich is expensiveand unstable largely because it does not enjoy the favorabletax treatment given to jobbased coveragewas supposed to bethe whole purpose of reform Instead CBO is confirmingthat new coverage mandates will drive premiums higher ButDemocrats are declaring victory claiming that these higherinsurance prices dont count because they will be offset bynew government subsidiesAbout 57 of the people who buy insurance through thebills new exchanges that will supplant todaysindividual market will qualify for subsidies that cover abouttwothirds of the total premium So the bill will increasecosts but it will then disguise those costs by transferringthem to taxpayers from individuals Higher costs can beconjured away because theyre suddenly on the governmentbalance sheet The Reid bills 3719 billion in new healthtaxes are also apparently not a new cost because they can bepassed along to consumers or perhaps will be hidden in lostwages This is the paleoliberal school of bruteforce wealth redistribution and avery long way from the repeated White House claims thatreform is all about bending the cost curve The onlything being bent here is the budget truthMoreover CBO is almost certainly underestimating the costincreases Based on its countybycounty actuarial data theinsurer WellPoint has calculated that Mr Baucuss bill wouldcause some premiums to triple in the individual market TheBlue Cross Blue Shield Association came to similarconclusions One reason is community rating which forcesinsurers to charge nearly uniform rates regardless ofcustomer health status or habits CBO doesnt think this willhave much of an effect but costs inevitably rise wheninsurers arent allowed to price based on risk This is whytoday some 35 states impose no limits on premium variationand six allow wide differences among consumersThe White House decided to shoot messengers like WellPointto avoid rebutting their message But Amanda Kowalski of MITWilliam Congdon of the Brookings Institution and MarkShowalter of Brigham Young have found similar results In a2008 paper in the peerreviewed Forum for Health Economicsand Policy these economists found that state communityrating laws raise premiums in the individual market by 209to 331 for families and 102 to 171 for singles In NewJersey which also requires insurers to accept all comerssocalled guaranteed issue premiums increased by as muchas 227The political tragedy is that there are plenty of reformalternatives that really would reduce the cost of insuranceAccording to CBO the relatively modest House GOP bill wouldactually reduce premiums by 5 to 8 in the individual marketin 2016 and by 7 to 10 for small businesses The GOPreforms would also do so without imposing huge new taxes ButDemocrats dont care because their bill isnt really aboutlowering costs Its about putting Washington in chargeof health insurance at any costThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The time of the Senator hasexpiredUnder the previous order the time until 1145 am shall be equallydivided between the Senator from Maryland Ms Mikulski and theRepublican leader or his designee   That was an editorial by the Wall Street Journal the staffof the Wall Street Journal confirmed by MIT Brigham Young andothers  Madam President I yield 2 minutes to the Senator fromKansas  President I yield 10 minutes to the Senator fromAlaska so she can actually propose her amendment that we have beendebating and take up to 10 minutes  If it does leaveus with 2 minutes then I would have the Senator from Wyoming use that2 minutes   President I wish to raise a point as the accountantaround here You have mentioned some ways to cut Medicare to pay forthis Actually there are only two ways you can pay for a governmentprogram You have to do it through cuts or through taxes I dont thinkthere is anybody in America who believes you can do 1 trillion worthof new programs and have them all paid for unless you steal somewhereThat is what we are doing from Medicare We say that is not going toaffect Medicare If you eliminate the DSH payments which are part ofthis it is going to put some Wyoming hospitals out of business I canassure you that if those seniors cant go to a hospital in their townthey are going to consider that a benefit cut They are going to beupset and they ought to beThe same with nursing homes If you cut back on nursing homes thepeople who have to move to another town for a nursing homebecause allof our towns dont have more than one nursing homeputs quite a burdennot only on the patient who isnt going to get to see their family asmuch but also on the family who has to travel a long way to see thepatient So I dont think we ought to be paying for the new programs bydoing this when Medicare needs an extended lifeI am always fascinated when they explain that this will extend thelife of Medicare because yes if you cut payments to everybody thatmaybe saves money and extends the life of it if we did that Is thereanybody who thinks we are going to cut the doctors over the next 10years by 250 billion No we are not going to do that We never have   President I wish to ask the Senator from Idaho what hethinks will happen with these Medicare cuts as they affect jobs and theeconomy That is one of the biggest things on peoples minds right nowjobs and the economy We are concentrating on something here where weare going to maybe make a difference even though CBO says it wont bemuch of a difference
S_OK_COBURN,2009-12-03, Madam President it is interesting as a practicingphysician who has actually cared for women and nobody so far who hasbeen in on this debate has ever done I congratulate the Senator fromMaryland for her care about prevention because we all know that is keyThe mischaracterization we heard about this bill is astounding Thereason we got in trouble with the Preventive Task Force is because itdid something that was inappropriate and did not have the appropriateprofessional groups on its task force when it made its recommendationon breast cancer screeningThe Murkowski amendment says we will rely on the professionalsocieties to make the determinations of what must be available We haveheard the Senator from Iowa say health insurance will decide that Thatis absolutely untrue Health insurance will not decide it Theprofessional societies will decide what will be covered and theinsurance companies must cover it under the Murkowski amendmentThe second point is there will not be any objective criteria Theobjective criteria doctors practice under today are the guidelines oftheir professional societiesHere is the difference between the Murkowski amendment and theMikulski amendment The Senator from Maryland relies on the governmentto make the decision on what will be covered She refers to the HealthResources and Services Administration She refers to the HealthResources and Services Administration which has no guidelineswhatsoever on womens health care right now other than prenatal careand childcare That is the only thing they haveFor whom does HRSA work HRSA works for the Secretary of Health andHuman Services So the contrast between these two amendments could notbe any more clear in terms of do we want to solve the problems we justexperienced on mammogram recommendations We can let the governmentdecide which got us into this trouble and they will set the practiceguidelines and recommendations for screening or you can let theAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or the AmericanCollege of Surgeons or the American College of Oncologists set and usetheir guidelinesThe choice is simple The government can decide what care you get orthe people who do the care the professionals who know what is neededwho write the peerreviewed articles who study the literature and makethe recommendations for their guidelinesEvery month I get from the American College of Obstetricians andGynecologists their new guidelines I try to follow them at everyinstance The fact is the Mikulski amendment says government willdecide That is what it says The government will decide through HRSAThe Murkowski amendment says it is the best practices known by thephysicians who are out there practicing What is the difference Howdoes it apply to you as a woman It applies to you as a woman becausethe people who know best get to make the recommendations rather than agovernment bureaucracy That is the differenceIf you will recall under the stimulus bill we passed we have a costcomparative effectiveness panel which will surely be in the mixassociated with the recommendations If you look at what the task forceon preventive recommendations said from a cost standpoint they wereabsolutely right From a patient standpoint they were absolutelywrongThe real debate on this billthe Mikulski amendment is the start ofthe real debateis do we have the government decide based on cost ordo we have the professional caregivers who know the field decide basedon what is best for that patient That is the differenceWhat the Senator from Alaska does which is necessary is she says wewill rely on the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology We willrely on the American College of Surgeons We will rely on the AmericanCollege of Oncologists to determine what should be the screeningrecommendations for patientsFor you see what happens with the Mikulski amendment is thegovernment stands between you and your doctor That is what is comingThat is what will be thereThere is no choice under the Murkowski amendment for an insurancecompany to have the option either to cover or not to cover They mustIt says shall do that So the mischaracterizations on what theMurkowski amendment actually says and does are unfortunateThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senators time has expiredThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Who yields timeThe Senator from Maryland  President the chart behind me shows the cuts inMedicare that are in this bill We have heard all sorts of arguments Ihave a few rhetorical questions for my colleagues and my friend thePresident of the United StatesThere is no question Medicare Advantage costs too much I have agreedto that with the chairman of the Finance Committee But you cannot saythat coordinated care does not improve the care of seniors and that isgoing to be cut You cannot say that eyeglasses and hearing aids arenot going to be cut and they do improve the care You cannot say toseniors who cannot afford a supplemental policy who have MedicareAdvantage they are not going to lose some of their care They are Infact 26 million according to the Congressional Budget Office aregoing to lose that very carenot some of it all of it They are goingto lose that advantage under this legislation The answer to thequestion will this impact seniors care is yes We have heard thesecuts arent going to impact anybody or the only people they are goingto impact are the insurance companies Well I am all for impacting theinsurance companies but I dont want to impact patients negativelySo we have cuts to Medicare including hospitals of 1347 billionhospices 77 billion nursing homes 146 billion MedicareAdvantage 120 billion home health agencies 421 billion and thenyou say you are not going to do anything to impact the care of seniorsMy colleague from Iowa whom I love disputed my statement about thefact that the life expectancy is going to go down under this bill Hehas never practiced medicine a day in his life I know what goes oninside hospitals When you cut 130 billion out of the hospitals thetime you are going to wait for me the time you wait after you pushyour call button is going to get extended and the complications fromthat are going to result in decreased quality of care and shortenedlife expectancies There is no question about itSo we can play the game but the real thing Americans ought to knowis almost 500 billion of spending on Medicare patients today is goingto go by the wayside to be spent on a new entitlement on a brandnewentitlementThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Brown The Senator from Idaho isrecognized  There is no question to answer my colleague from Idahothat if it doesnt eliminate the ability it will deny by delaying theability Care delayed is care denied All you have to do is read all ofthe tragedies that have gone on in this country for people who havedelayed care which has resulted in large complications for thatindividual  Would the Senator yield for a moment  My one criticism of my colleagues in writing this bill isI think there is money we can save in Medicare It is called wastefraud and abuse A Harvard professor who studies this says there is atleast 125 billion a year in fraud We have had several studies thatsay it is anywhere from 100 billion to 175 billion a year There isnothing in this bill to eliminate fraud What we are doing is we aretaking care from seniors instead of taking the money from thefraudulent actors in the health care system We are in trouble in Medicare in this Nation Everybody knows it Wehave made promises The unfunded liability on Medicare is 79 trillionFor us to take 12 trillion no matter what the Enron accountingsays afterward the fact is we are going to reduce that we are goingto make that worse We may not make it worse next year or the yearafter but we are going to make it worse It is going to be worse forseniors but it is also as the Senator from Tennessee said going tobe extremely worse for the seniors kids and grandkids Not only havewe done that we have raised the taxes in Medicare on a certain groupof people and we are going to take that money and not put it inMedicare we are going to take that money a Medicare tax and create anew entitlementSo the Senator from Florida is absolutely right If you vote againstthe MCCain motion you are saying you want to cut 12 trillion out ofMedicare and that it will have no effect whatsoever on the careI remind the Senator from Florida there are 1 million people onMedicare Advantage in the State of Florida 1 million people who aregoing to lose benefits under this bill One million people in the Stateof Florida will lose benefits under this bill  I dont know that tobe factual as of yet What I do know is we are going to have 44 millionbaby boomers in the next 12 years jump into Medicare and we are cuttingMedicare We are going to have 44 million baby boomers jump intoMedicare I am one of them We are going to cut the amount of availablefunds from Medicare under this bill  Does 60 Plus sell supplementalinsurance policies to seniors  I wonder why people want seniors offMedicare Advantage
S_MI_STABENOW,2009-12-03, Madam President first I thank Senator Mikulski forher leadership not only on this important amendment but on so manyissues in health care issues for women across this country We arehonored to call her dean for all of us as it relates to focusing on theissues that are so critical to women and their familiesI thank Senator Reid for making this a priority and making this thefirst amendment we are offering in this debateWe all know that often women are the ones making health caredecisions for their families as well as themselves They are morelikely to be the person making health insurance choices Women ofchildbearing age pay on average 68 percent more for their health carethan men do We have so many instances in which insurance companies arestanding between women and their doctors right now in makingdecisionsdecisions not to cover preventive services such as amammogram screening or a cervical cancer screening decisions to callpregnancy a preexisting condition so women cannot get health insurancedecisions not to cover maternity care so that women and their babiescan get the care they need so that babies can be successful in lifeboth prenatal care and postnatal careWomen of this country have a tremendous stake in health care reformWe pay more now if we can find coverage at all and there are too manyways in which insurance companies block women from getting the basichealth services they needThis amendment is critically important to make sure that women areableto get preventive care services without a deductible and withoutcopays This amendment recognizes the unique health needs of women Itrequires coverage of womens preventive services developed by womenshealth experts to meet the unique needs of womenWhy do we stress that We stress that because for years we havestruggled in so many areas to make sure that womens health needs werefocused on and not just health in general When we look at researchthrough the National Institutes of Health and what it took to get to aplace where research would be done for women on womens subjects or onfemale mice or rats rather than male subjects to make sure that thedifferences between men and women were considered in research we havemade important steps in that direction Again Senator Mikulski wasleading the way as it relates to having a womens health researcheffort in our countryThis is one more step to make sure we are covering womens preventiveservices developed by womens health experts for the unique needs ofwomen That is what this is all aboutmaking sure women have access topreventive services such as cervical cancer screenings osteoporosisscreenings annual mammograms for women under 50 pregnancy and postpartum screenings domestic violence screenings and annual checkupsfor womenWe know more women die of heart disease than actually any otherdisease This is something I do not think is widely known We have evenheard that many physicians do not realize the extent to which heartdisease is prevalent in women All of us women have worked together ona womens heart bill and part of that is for screenings Part of thatis to make sure we are screening for heart disease and strokes the No1 killer of women This would make sure those screenings would be partof health care reformI could go on to list all the different prevention items but I willsimply say that when we are talking about womens health and we aretalking about womens lives this is an incredibly important amendmentto adoptThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senators time has expired
S_TX_HUTCHISON,2009-12-03, Madam President I rise to speak on the Mikulskiamendment and the Murkowski amendment because I feel very passionateabout womens issues In fact Senator Mikulski and I have workedthroughout my time in the Senate and her time before me on these veryissuesassuring that womens health care concerns which are differentfrom mens in many instances are a part of any health care coverage inour country and ongoing we must assure the sameI have been an advocate for cancer screening services for women andI was dismayed when I saw the US Preventive Services Task Force a fewweeks ago issuing new guidelines for cancer screening for womenbreastcancer screening for women We have all lived with breast cancerthroughout the course of the history of women but especially in thelast probably 25 years the strides that we have made in saving livesand in the survivability of women with breast cancer is because we havehad early detection We dont have a cure for breast cancer and we areall fighting for that cure but until we get it the first line ofdefense is early detectionSo now we have a new task force recommendation that says everythingwe have had and enjoyed over the last 25 years in saving womens livesis no longer relevant because now before the age of 50 you dont needa mammogram and after the age of 50 it is every other yearWell I know Senator Mikulski and I agree we do not think that isright Neither did any other woman in the Senate when that was proposedyears ago by President Clinton We all stood up and said no I amstanding up and I am saying no once again and I am sure every woman inthe Senate is as many women in America areBut the Mikulski amendment doesnt actually fully address the problemof having the task forcewhich is relied on 14 times in the billbefore usas the arbiter of what is necessary for our governmentprogram and that it then will surely become the private sector standardas well That task force even has money allocated to advertize its taskforce recommendations So rather than the Mikulski amendment severingthe ties with the task force the amendment now has another governmentagency that has the same capability to basically interfere between thewoman and her doctor which is where we want the decisions to be madeCoverage decisions will be dictated by both the task force and a newHealth Resources and Services Administration entry into the mixWhile I certainly agree with Senator Mikulski about the importance ofpreventive services for women and insurance coverage decisions I cantsupport her amendment because we still have not one but two governmenttask forces and committees that will be in the middle of these healthcare coverage decisions I think the coverage decisions should be madeby doctors and their patients That is why I have joined with SenatorMurkowski in offering the alternative approach This is what we shouldexpect from any future health care reform and it is certainly what weexpect todayThe Murkowski amendment will leave the medical decisions to theguidelines established by those who know medical treatment best whichis our own doctors In fact we have just received a CBO assessment ofwhat the Murkowski amendment would cost and it actually says therewill be a savings So rather than the Mikulski amendment which wouldspend 1 billion over 10 years the Murkowski amendment would actuallysave 14 billion over 10 years Why Because the Murkowski amendmentrelies on the combined commonsense and clinical judgment of AmericanphysiciansThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senators time has expired So Madam President I urge a vote for the Murkowskiamendment I know we have the same goals as Senator Mikulski and heramendment but I dont believe the Mikulski amendment achieves the goalof having a woman and her doctor make the decisions for her That isthe key that I think is so important in this debate I urge a vote forthe Murkowski amendmentI thank the Chair and I yield the floorThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Who yields time
S_CT_DODD,2009-12-03, So there is an incentive to trim the cost of theadministration of the program It is also true the plans get bonuspayments for care coordination and quality and plans can use thesebonuses to improve benefits  Is it alsotrue that roughly 80 percent of Medicare beneficiaries dont get any ofthese benefits  And that the average Medicare couple over the age of 65 ispaying I am told about 90 a year more in Medicare payments forbenefits they dont get  So here we have 75 to 80 percent of the beneficiaries ofMedicare paying more money and not getting the benefits for a programthat costs more than 14 percent more and it is a private plan    It is aprivate health care plan Medicare is a public plan Medicare Advantageis not Medicare and it is certainly not an advantage given theoverpayments that occurred  Our bill does something that I think our friend fromOklahoma Senator Coburn pointed out that is absolutely criticalwhich is that competitive bidding did not exist in the originalWho was setting these rates originally during this period of timeHow did these rates get set Did Congress set them  Is it true that if these Medicare Advantage plans come inunder the benchmark bid they actually get a piece of the savings Isthat correct as well  My colleague understands that Ihope Medicare Advantage is a private plan You know that of coursedont you I assume you know that  If my colleague will yield I appreciate what the Senatorhas just done This is an area where I think there is a lot ofconfusion and misunderstanding A lot of it begins with just thebranding the title of something This was frankly a revelation tome going back a number of weeks ago I heard the words MedicareAdvantage I thought this has to be part of the regular MedicareProgram because it has that title  If my colleague will correct me if I am wrong this is nottraditional Medicare this is a private plan right  In looking back a few years ago the original reasonand Idont recall the debate as well as my colleague the chairman of theFinance Committee does As I remember the original idea behind thiswasand he said this already but it deserves being repeatedthis wasa way of cutting costs reducing expenditures In a sense we were soldthis idea on the fact that we could do this better more efficientlyat far less cost  A couple ofthings happened since then One I think the overpayments on averageare around 14 percent  If I can reclaim my time 80 percent of older Americans arepaying 90 more a year for this Do they have any say in this Theydont get any of the benefits Why are they writing a check for 90 ayear to pay a private plan from which they get no benefits What aboutthem Dont they deserve something in all this   Thisplan gets subsidized by the American taxpayers That is the onlyqualification that puts it under the Medicare umbrella because ourtaxpayers are writing a check to a private company That is why it getsincluded as part of Medicare Other than that it is a private plan  Medicare Advantage decides how to use their extra paymentsto provide benefits They decide Congress does not There is nothingin the legislation that forces plans to reduce benefits at all ratherthan reducing profitsMedicare Advantage is one of the profitable business lines of theprivate insurance In fact the New York Times on November 2justabout a month agoreportedHumana the health insurer posted on Monday a 65 percentjump in thirdquarter profitsWe are talking about private health care These are profits a 65percent jump in profits off this planas bulging membership and premiums from Medicare Advantageovercame a lackluster commercial segmentI appreciate the fact that people are getting eyeglasses and thingsThat is wonderful But we need to be clear about this These are notthe guaranteed benefits and 80 percent of Medicare beneficiaries getnone of these advantages and yet pay more so other people under thisprivate health care planbecause it is subsidized by the Americantaxpayersget themAgain now we are going to put competitive bidding in place Our billallows under these plans if they follow and do some of theincentives to actually share in some of the profits We are nottalking about eliminating all of this plan We are trying to make itwork better for people under the billWe have to be honest what we are talking about This is a privateinsurance company that is subsidized by the American taxpayers It isnot what traditionally people think of Medicare   What I wish to say and what I wish to ask my colleague  There is not a single guaranteedbenefit under Medicare that is cut in this bill Not one I defy anyMember of this body to identify a guaranteed benefit under Medicarethat gets cut You cannot find one Do we cut out gym memberships andthings such as that Yes that may happen But on the guaranteedbenefitsoperative word is guaranteedunder guaranteed benefitsthere is not a single cut to a benefit That is why an organizationrepresenting 40 million Americans that endorsed the Bush prescriptiondrug plan by the way in 2003hardly a partisan organization as somehave suggested todayhas basically opposedthe MCCain motion and has endorsed the legislation before us todayThat organization I say to my good friend would never be endorsing abill that was going to cut guaranteed benefits under Medicare  Let me point out one of the things we have not talkedabout I say to my friend from Mississippi under our legislation thisbill protects seniors in Medicare Advantage from plans that care moreabout profits than seniors trying to pass the buck Under our bill itallows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to kick out any planunder Medicare Advantage that significantly increases their premiums ordecreases their benefits Under existing law that would not happenunder our bill it doesIt is not about being hostile to Medicare Advantage It is beingrealistic about all this and trying to make the tough decisions we haveto make about trying to stabilize Medicare seeing to it we are goingto have protections in premium reductions and cost savings as well asincreasing access and qualityAll we are trying to point out is when you have a Medicare Advantageplan that has run as poorly as this one has at great cost we nowlearned14 percent above on average some places it is 50 percentabove averagewhere is the equity By the way I say to my friend fromMississippi it is a private health care plan that receives subsidiesfrom the American taxpayers where 80 percent of seniors today pay moreand get nothing for it Where is the equity in this There is no equityin this Why should 80 percent of that population pay 90 or more ayear on average for a benefit they dont get Where is the equity  Madam President I ask unanimous consent for 2 additionalminutes Madam President let me say to my colleague again that herewe have two organizations representing 43 million seniors in ourcountry and these are organizations that dont just write letters onthe fly They have staffs that examine proposals here and that is allthey do We have AARP which is an organization that is highly regardedand well recognized representing 40 million seniors in the countryand the Commission to Preserve Social Security and Medicare whichrepresents an additional 3 million and that is all they do This is atotally nonpartisan examination These two organizations representingalmost 50 million of our seniors have examined this bill in detailevery dotted I every semicolon every comma every proposalandhave done exhaustive research and they have said This is a good billThis bill is deserving of supportWe received a letter today from them They are not Democrats Theyare not Republicans They are not trying to get an advantage overanybody They are examining whether this bill stabilizes andstrengthens Medicare puts seniors in a stronger position is going tosee to it that we can extend the life of the program and provideguaranteed benefits that are needed and their answer was a resoundingyesyes this bill is deserving of our supportAgain I appreciate the political debate here but at some point wehave to step back and let those whose job it is to analyze oursuggestions and our ideasjust as AARP supported President Bush 6years ago with his prescription drug bill They didnt join Democratsor Republicans they liked the ideastill doand supported it Todaythey are not supporting us as Democrats They would reject this billout of hand if they thought we did something adverse to the interest oftheir membership But they said No this is a good bill deserving ofsupport The two largest organizations in this country representingseniors have said Get behind this bill Lets support our seniorsLets make Medicare stronger and strengthen it And this bill does itThat is why we should be joining together not fighting over thisMedicare Advantage is a private health care plan subsidized by theAmerican taxpayer Eighty percent of the seniors dont get theAdvantage That is why we are creating these changes in this billI applaud my colleague from Montana the chairman of the FinanceCommittee who did incredible work along with his staff and othermembers in producing this product
H_MA_NEAL,2009-12-16, Madam Speaker I will remind the gentlemanit wasnt a liberal sitting in the White House who decided to invadeIraq for which the costs have now come dueI reserve the balance of my time  Madam Speaker I yield 3 minutes to myfriend the gentleman from New Jersey Mr AndrewsMr ANDREWS asked and was given permission to revise and extend hisremarks  Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to myfriend the gentleman from New York a voice of good sense on theissues of debt Mr Crowley  Madam Speaker I yield myself such time asI might consumeMadam Speaker I rise in support of the debt limit legislation we areconsidering today and I want to thank Mr Rangel for his hard work onthe bill in the waning days of the Congress this first sessionLet me talk about what the bill does This bill is simply aboutcontinuing operations for the Federal Government That is the title ofthe legislation Continuing operations means getting the SocialSecurity checks out on time an almost sacred duty that we have Thismeans providing support for our troops and keeping our museums and ourparks open That is what an increase in the debt limit will allowSimply stated this is about bills that have already been incurredNow I will during my time here resist the temptation to becomeoverlypartisan and speak specifically to the issue that is in front of usuntil there is a misstatement of the facts in oppositionWhat this bill does not do is increase or decrease spending That isa key consideration Those decisions have already been made through theregular order Let me emphasize the following This bill does not raisenor does it cut taxes That is different legislation I respect theopinion of all Members herewho by the way my hunch is have been onall sides of this issue during their time here in the Congress But weall desire the same and that is to bring our budget into balance withthe future Beyond that there is broad agreement But this bill issimply paying the check after the items have already been ordered Thisbill would raise the limit by 290 billion which is estimated to allowthe government to operate through February 11 and allow us to adjournfor the yearDespite what some might say the Treasury Department will reach thecurrent limit on the national debt by December 31 and they have toldus that there is no ability to do extraordinary measures that willindeed stretch that outNow I hope that the offering that I make to resist demagoguery onthis issue will be met If not we certainly will have an opportunityduring the course of the next hour to slug it out based upon the factsand I hope that we will regard Social Security and veterans bills thathave already been incurred to be paid We certainly can have moments ofinstructions herewere all indeed prepared for that on all sidesbutI hope that the opportunity to resist the temptation to dismiss thereality of what were doing here will be before all of usI reserve my time  Madam Speaker I would like to yield to avoice of fiscal responsibility here in the House to Mr Boyd thegentleman from Florida for 2 minutes  I yield the gentleman an additional 1minute  Madam Speaker before I come to myfriends comments I want to yield myself such time as I might consumeMadam Speaker I spoke with Chairman Rangel earlier and it is ourintention as we did this month in passing the Tax Extenders Act of2009 to make sure that those provisions hold That bill contains a 1year extension of dozens of important expiring provisions includingthe popular RD credit the sales tax deduction and the college tuitiondeduction among many othersWe are now hearing the Senate may not take up this provision orprovisions and pass the bill before they expire on December 31 It isour intention to insist upon the House position and to work to ensurethat our bill providing a seamless extension of these tax benefits willbe enacted as soon as possible in the new yearThese provisions are crucial for both American business andindividual taxpayers and I am pleased that we were able to get theHouse to pass this bill before the year concluded but it isdisappointing that the other body will not be able to take it up thisyear It is our goal however to ensure that this bill will provide aseamless extension when enacted based upon the House measureMadam Speaker I want to thank Mr Pence because I thought that thetone of what he offered was entirely reasonable because he didnt passout partisan blame in the instance that brings us here at this timeBut a gentle reminder I dont know how you could have voted for thewar in Iraq and not vote now to pay the bill because thats part ofwhat we are being asked to do today I understand how difficult thisis why it causes heartburn But having said that how can you say thatyou were willing to commit 160000 soldiers to Iraq and when the billcomes due not pay it That essentially is the argument that is infront of us todayAnd I understand the arguments about those American families who arehaving a difficult time as we proceed to this holiday season and wewant to be as helpful to them as we can And as they gather around thekitchen table to talk about the problems they have we understand thatwe want to provide as much support for them as we can But lets notforget the Social Security recipients who are currently sitting aroundthe table as they watch this debate wondering if their checks aregoing to be mailed to them on time at the first of the yearWith that I reserve the balance of my time  Madam Speaker at this time I would liketo yield 4 minutes to my friend the gentleman from Tennessee MrTanner who was my classmate here 21 years ago and is in my judgmentas thoughtful as any Member of this House on the issues of the nationaldebt  I yield the gentleman 2 additionalminutes  Madam Speaker I yield the gentleman fromNew Jersey 1 additional minute  Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to thedistinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee the gentlemanfrom New York Mr RangelMr RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend hisremarks  Madam Speaker might I inquire as to howmuch time remains on both sides Madam Speaker this is not a cheery time for the American peopleThis is a very difficult time A reminder The legislation in front ofus now is to pay for the war in Iraq to pay for the war inAfghanistan to pay for our veterans hospitals and to pay for nextmonths Social Security recipients to receive their checks on timeI reserve the balance of my time Madam Speaker the war in Iraq is going to cost more than 1trillion The VA hospital commitment that we are going to make for thenext 30 years to our welldeserving veterans is going to cost anadditional 1 trillion That is the issue that is before us thisafternoonI reserve the balance of my time  Madam Speaker I reserve the balance of mytime  Stearns is indeed my friend and weare classmatesMadam Speaker he conveniently left out those 4 years when BillClinton left a balanced budget to America when the deficits wereeliminated and when the debt was coming down Thats the keyconsideration here as we begin this debate Indeed this is aboutpaying for our veterans hospitals paying for the war in Iraq payingfor the war in Afghanistan and making sure that those Social Securitychecks get out on January 1  Madam Speaker I reserve the balance of mytime  Madam Speaker I ask unanimous consentthat all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise andextend their remarks and to include extraneous material on HR 4314 Madam Speaker pursuant to clause 7 ofrule XX I move a call of the House Madam Speaker I would like to reserve thebalance of my time  Madam Speaker let me recognize for 1minute the Majority Leader the gentleman from Maryland Mr

ofhis truck he was struck by a car and tragically lost both of his legsas a result of the accidentThe outpouring of support for Mr Rondeno and his family thatfollowed his hospitalization stands as a

Rondeno in hisrecovery and signs of support for the letter carrier could be seenhanging in a variety of local storefronts along his routeRegrettably on October 2 only 6 days after this accident MrRondeno died from heart failure during surgery Mr Rondeno was only 57years old at the time of his death and he had planned on retiring fromthe postal service early next year so as to focus his attention onserving his New Orleans community in a different capacity through anoutreach ministry that he had recently founded with his beloved wifeShirleyAs noted by Acting Louisiana District Manager

materialsMr Speaker on behalf of the chairman of the full Committee onOversight and Government Reform Chairman Towns and its members I amproud to present HR 2711 the Special Agent Samuel Hicks Families ofFallen Heroes Act for considerationThis bipartisan legislation was introduced on June 4 2009 byRepresentative Mike Rogers of Michigan and several members of theOversight Committee including Chairman Ed Towns and RepresentativesBill Foster Elijah Cummings and Brian Bilbray In addition thislegislation was favorably reported out of the Oversight Committee onSeptember 10 2009 by voice vote HR 2711 is a worthy and importantissue and I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this billAs reported by the Oversight Committee the legislation wouldauthorize the FBI to pay the relocation and moving expenses forfamilies of FBI agents who are killed in the line of duty Undercurrent law the FBI is only authorized to pay these expenses if an FBIagent or an employee is killed overseas but cannot pay for relocationif the death occurs in the USFBI employees and their families are moved routinely by the Bureauwithin the United States to take on assignments that further themission of the agency and the security of the country While we wishthis legislation was not necessary tragically there have beeninstances in the recent past where such authority was needed to supportthe families of agents or employees who gave their livesOf course untimely deaths in the Federal law enforcement communityare not limited to the FBI and the Bureau is not the only Federalagency that relocates its employees to better protect the countryRecognizing this the bill we are considering on the floor todayincludes a straightforward but important amendment that recognizes theservice and sacrifice of all Federal law enforcement officers Theamendment simply extends the authority in this legislation to the otheragencies that employ Federal law enforcement officersThis amendment has strong support from the Federal law enforcementcommunity I should also note that the costs associated with this billremain small as the number of Federal law enforcement officers killedannually is approximately 12 to 15 officers We can and should assisteach and every one of these families by supporting this amendment andthis bill Moreover the amendment also pays tribute to the memory andservice of Special Agent Samuel Hicks by renaming the legislation inhis honor Special Agent Hicks was assigned to the Pittsburgh FBIoffice and was shot fatally on November 19 2008 at the age of 33 whileexecuting a Federal search warrant associated with a drug distributionring He is survived by his wife and their 2yearold sonSpecial Agent Hicks was a former police officer with the Baltimorepolice department He and his family relocated to Pittsburgh when hebecame an FBI agent Unfortunately after the loss of Special AgentHicks the Bureau was unable to assist the Hicks family in moving backto Baltimore because of statutory limitationsThis legislation would correct this problem and prevent futurefamilies from suffering additional unnecessary grief and hardship Iencourage all the Members to support Mr Rogers and his legislationI reserve the balance of our time  Speaker I move to suspend the rules and pass the billHR 4017 to designate the facility of the United States PostalService located at 43 Maple Avenue

S_CA_BOXER,2009-12-01,The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from California isrecognized The plan is women colleagues will be coming to thefloor As they come I will yield to them until Senator Mikulski getshere and then she will yield the time if that is all right  President before I start I want to say to mycolleague from Connecticut how much I appreciate his work and the workof Senator Baucus and Senator Reid What a remarkable moment we havehereWhen I go homeand I was home for the holidayspeople are urging usto get this done They know their biggest chance of going intobankruptcy is a health care crisis62 percent They know as my friendSenator Dodd has said almost every day of this debate every morning14000 people lose their health care They know if we do not intervenewith a good bill their premiumsin my home State I say to theSenatorwill be 41 percent of their income the average income by2016Can you imagine That is unsustainable For people who say Why dontwe address the economy instead of health care let me say what happensto my constituents if they have to pay 41 percent of their income forpremiums Even if they have a good job I say to my friend fromConnecticut they cannot make it So the status quo is cruel and it isparticularly cruel to womenAmendment No 2791 President I am proud to support the MikulskiHarkinBoxer amendment to improve preventive health coverage for women TheMikulski amendment addresses this critical issue by requiring that allhealth plans cover comprehensive womens preventive care andscreeningsand cover these recommended services at little or no costto women These health care services include annual mammograms forwomen at age 40 pregnancy and postpartum depression screeningsscreenings for domestic violence annual womens health screenings andfamily planning servicesThe preventive services covered under this amendment would bedetermined by the Health Resources and Services Administration to meetthe unique preventive health needs of women HRSA is an agency withinthe Department of Health and Human Services HHS Secretary KathleenSebelius has already said that Mammograms have always been animportant lifesaving tool in the fight against breast cancer and theystill are today The Secretary made clear that recommendations by theUS Preventive Services Task Force do not set federal policy andthey dont determine what services are covered by the federalgovernmentThis is not the first time that experts have disagreed about thisissue I have been in this battle before with Senator Mikulski whocalled a hearing with all of the women Senators in 1994 where Iinsisted that routine mammograms for women over 40 must be covered Andthank goodness we fought back then and in 1997 and in 2002 when thisissue was raised again and again Since 1991 the death rate frombreast cancer has been reduced by over 20 percentAccording to a 2007 Partnership for Prevention report 3700additional lives would be saved each year if we increased to 90 percentthe portion of women age 40 and older who have been screened for breastcancer in the past 2 years The most recent data show us thatapproximately 17 percent of breast cancer deaths occurred in women whowere diagnosed in their forties That is why the American CancerSociety continues to recommend annual screening using mammography andclinical breast examination for all women beginning at age 40Mammograms are still the most effective and valuable tool fordecreasing suffering and death from breast cancer The Mikulskiamendment will ensure women are able to get access to this and otherlifesaving preventive services at no costThe underlying bill introduced by Senator Reid already requires thatpreventive services recommended by the US Preventive Services TaskForce be covered at little to no cost These recommendations alreadyinclude some womens preventive services such as osteoporosisscreeningsBut they do not include certain recommendations that many womenshealth advocates and medical professionals believe are criticallyimportant such as screenings for ovarian cancera disease that willclaim the lives of nearly 15000 women this year We know that whenovarian cancer is diagnosed early more than 93 percent of womensurvive longer than 5 yearsWomen are often the decisionmakers for their families when it comesto health care But women too often put the health needs of theirfamily members and their children ahead of their ownBy passing this amendment we are saving the lives of countlessmothers daughters grandmothers and sisters who would otherwise forgopreventative health care because of high copays and expensivedeductiblesI would like to share with my colleagues a story from a doctor in myhome State of California William Leininger that drives home theimportance of this amendmentIn my last year of residency I cared for a mother of twowho had been treated for cervical cancer when she was 23 Atthat time she was covered by her husbands insurance but itwas an abusive relationship and she lost her healthinsurance when they divorcedFor the next five years she had no health insurance andnever received followup care which would have revealed thather cancer had returned She eventually remarried andregained health insurance but by the time she came back tosee me her cancer had spreadShe had two children from her previous marriageherdriving motivation during her last rounds of palliative carewas to survive long enough to ensure that her abusive exhusband wouldnt gain custody of her kids after her deathShe succeeded She was 28 when she diedThat is not a story that should be told in the richest nation in theworldAs I said I am so proud to support the MikulskiHarkinBoxeramendment to improve preventive health care coverage for women Here iswhy It is a fact that women are increasingly delaying or skippingaltogether preventive health care and they are doing it because ofcostsI read a statistic done by a nonpartisan group that said about 39percent of men are delaying going to a physician to check on a problemBut over 50 percent of women are doing that either because they do nothave health coverage or they are fearful of the copay So we could sithere and do nothingthat is the easy thing to do Scare people donothingor we could step to the plate save Medicare which is veryimportant to save and that is what this bill does Because we say weare not going to spend money on waste fraud and abuse We are goingto spend money on health care for our peopleAnd to believe that my friends on the other side are the ones who aregoing to save Medicare You just have to read history Senator Doddexplained it Newt Gingrich saying Let Medicare wither on the vineBob Dole our friend who said at the time of his Presidentialcampaign I fought against Medicare It was a failureWell if you ask our seniors I think they are the group most pleasedwith their coverage It is not perfect but it is critical and we saveit here We extend the life of MedicareSo here we are in a situation where many women are delaying going tothe doctor getting their preventive services and the Mikulskiamendment addresses this critical issue It requires that all healthplans cover comprehensive womens preventive care and screenings andcover them at little or no costThe reason this is so important isfirst of all in the HELPCommittee under Senator Dodds and Senator Kennedys leadership thispiece of the package was in the bill because Senator Mikulski andothers pushed so hard to get it placed into the billMr President I would ask my friend from Maryland Senator Mikulskiif I could complete my remarks and then give the floor over to herMr President I thank the SenatorI am so proud to work with Senator Mikulski I say to the Senator weworked on this issue over the years I just asked my staff to go backand look at the first time we teamed up to ensure that women getmammograms at age 40 That was in 1994 Then again over the yearsevery 3 or 4 years this whole notion would rear its ugly head Wellwomen can do without mammography The question I have is What is goingto replace it They would keep trying to take away our tools of selfexamination and mammography We know if you look through the yearsandSenator Mikulski and I are proud of a lot of the work we do but thisgoes right at the top of the listwe know mortality for breast canceris way down since the early 1990s It is 20 percent down since theearly 1990s We have had to stand our ground to protect women to makesure they get those services they need those lifesaving services atlittle or no costI would also say the American Cancer Society continues to recommendannual screening using mammography and clinical breast exams for allwomen beginning at age 40 There are a lot of other very importanttests that are included in the Mikulski amendmentvery importantteststo deal with cervical cancer and ovarian cancer finding themarkers so we know how to deal with these deadly diseases To give upthe tools we have to turn it over to some organization that does notreport to the Secretary of HHS makes no senseWhat my friend has done with her amendment is to make sure the groupthat decides this is under the jurisdiction of the HHS Secretary Weknow the HHS Secretary has already said she wants to make sure womenstarting at age 40 get those mammogramsI am going to close by reading from an article in the March 10 1994San Francisco Chronicle It saysJoining what became a phalanx of six female Senatorsstaring down at federal health officials Boxer said she willinsist that routine mammograms and a host of other womenshealth needs be part of any new nationwide benefit packageThe article goes on It is very clear What I said at the time isAfter all of these years of women being told it is crucialby age 40 to get a baseline mammogram now to have thistremendous confusion hit us is very disturbingWell it was disturbing on March 10 1994 when I first got involvedin this issue It was disturbing when Senator Snowe 3 years later hadus pass S Res 47 which said this is our only tool Lets do it Thankgoodness we have now in this body women and men who get the fact thatwe refuse as women to be stripped of the only tools we have Making allof these important tests part of this package is going to save livesIt is going to save money It is going to mean our families can breathea deep sigh of relief out thereSo I wish to thank Senator Mikulski for her leadership on this issueand to always stand right at her side on this issue of mammography Wealso worked on standards for mammography Remember that one It was thederegulation fever that hit the Republican side They wanted to takeaway the regulations for mammography roll them back We fought thefight and we will continue to fight the fightSo thank you very much I strongly support this amendmentI yield the floor for my friend Senator MikulskiThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Maryland isrecognized
S_CT_DODD,2009-12-01,  President our colleague from Maryland SenatorMikulski I believe is on her way to the floor of the Senate She andseveral other Members in the time we have allocated to us between nowand 1130 will address her amendment she proposed yesterday Butpending her arrival I want to respond if I could very briefly tosome of the conversation here this morningFirst I know some people have short memories but I am somewhatintrigued to hear our good friends and colleagues talk about preservingMedicare I have been around here a few years and recall very vividlythe debates of 1995 and 1997 on the issue of Medicare where ourfriends who were in the majority in those days were talking aboutslowing the growth of Medicare and one of the proposals they had fordoing so was to cut into the benefits of Medicare recipientsWe do not do that in this bill at all Quite to the contrary despitethe language about big cuts in Medicare we strengthen the MedicareProgram substantially That is the reason the AARP and other majororganizations involved with the elderly have endorsed our proposalsThey would hardly be doing so if they thought this was some massive cutinto the Medicare Program that has been so critical to so many of ourfellow citizensJust for a little bit of history hereIn 1995 our Republicancolleagues proposed cutting benefits to Medicare beneficiaries NewtGingrich our former Speaker and friend from the other body was quotedas saying lets let Medicare wither on the vine That is notancient history That is not 1965That is just a few years ago in all of this debateThere are some very strong provisions in the bill that reducepremiums and copays for seniors ensure seniors are able to see theirown doctors and keep Medicare from going bankrupt for an additional 5years If we adopt the MCCain amendment we are being told today by CBOand others that Medicare becomes insolvent in 8 years So vote for theMCCain amendment and you are going to have an insolvent program in 8years That is a factWe extend the life here an additional 5 years We provide newpreventive and wellness benefits for seniors lower prescription drugcosts allow seniors to stay in their homes and not end up in nursinghomesThis is a long bill It is a big bill But instead of complainingabout its size I would encourage my colleagues to read it andunderstand what is being done for Medicare This is a complicated areabut nonetheless critically importantMr President I see my colleague from California Senator Boxer whois here and others who want to address the issue of the Mikulskiamendment and I will yield the floor so they can be heard I believeit is going to be each for 5 minutes There are about seven of ourcolleagues who want to be heard on the issue before 1130  Madam President I ask unanimous consent I be allowed tospeak for 1 minute 7 seconds and the time be taken from that of my goodfriend and colleague from Vermont the chairman of the JudiciaryCommittee Madam President Senator Tom Coburn and I have become greatfriends We have spent a lot of time together this summer in my HELPCommittee He talked with great eloquence about that distance that canoccur between a doctor and patient and obviously as someone whopracticed medicine for a long time he speaks from strong personalexperience and I admire and respect that immensely But let me say tomy colleagues without this bill we are talking about here this comesto a simple choice Under existing law the way things are today oneinstitution stands between a doctor and patient and that is yourinsurance company They ration care all the time In fact I am aliving example of rationed care having been through surgery gettingpreapproval twice before surgery and then being rejected by the veryinsurance company I paid premiums to for a long time as a Member ofthis body We are working it out I believe because they thoughtI am65that Medicare ought to pay for my surgery rather than the company Ipaid premiums to for a long timeThey were rationing my care That insurance company it wasnt somegovernment entity or someone else they are the ones Without our billthe only one getting to decide what health services anyone receives isthe insurance industryI hope we would have a chance to debate this further as I amconfident we willLet me also say how much I support the effort by Senator Mikulski onher efforts to see to it that women are treated equally andparticularly in preventive care and I strongly urge the adoption ofher amendment and ask to be added as a cosponsor to that amendment  President the Senator from Iowa is to be recognizednext  Just to set the record straightbecause it is amazing to me in a very short amount of time how peoplecan misconstrue events First of all the Senator from Oklahoma wastalking about the Medicare Advantage bill and he said Do you know whosets the rates The government sets the ratesThat is true That is because when that bill was passed with veryfew people on this side supporting that billalmost overwhelmingly onthe other sidethe requirement under the law the requirement to passmandated under the law that the private plans of Medicare be overpaidand on average those overpayments averaged 14 percent and in someStates over 50 percent The law that was passed here by the majorityand running the place at the timeinsisted upon the mandates beingincluded So if you wonder why that occurs today it is because theyrequired it in the lawSecondly when you talk about the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005again memories fade for some people In fact under that billchildren working families lost the insurance they had Cuts occurredWomen lost access to mammographies Cervical cancer screenings werecut Families lost benefits There were direct cuts in them Thedifference is today with what we are talking about you dont cutthese benefits at allat all In fact we are increasing theopportunity for Medicare to be strengthened under this bill There is avast difference between what happened in 2005 and what is beingsupported today So again I just want the record to be clear Youcant make these things up as you go along That is what happened in2005 It was an abomination and did great damage to people in thiscountry People lost their insuranceUnder our bill 31 million Americans will have coverage We now knowthe premiums are going to drop for 93 percent of all AmericansPremiums will actually come down for individuals small businesses andlarge employers For five out of six people who have their jobs thosepremiums come down Thirtyone million Americans will be covered withhealth insurance Compare that if you will with 2005 when we actuallycut mammography screening cervical cancer research and assistance inhealth care for infants and children and women That all got damaged inthat year Not in this bill This is the differenceI thank my colleague for yielding   People hadthe right to do so that was their choice at the time But to try torewrite history somehow and say those cuts didnt occurin fact theydid occur in these areas That is why there were those of us here whoobjected strongly at the time My colleague from Arizona is absolutelycorrect when he said that I said this was going to cut benefits forchildren and working families and cut screenings and tests for peopleIt did do that Those of us who made those warnings on that day wereproven to be 100 percent accurate Compare that ifyou will with what we are talking about here today particularlyregarding reducing costs premiums and providing increased access formillions of Americans That is the differenceIf you vote for the MCCain amendment we are right back where we werebeforeright backwhich of course we all know means premiumincreases go up by literally 100 percent in the next 7 years Tell thatto a family of four in my State who is paying 12000 right now andwill go to 24000 in 7 years as opposed to having those premiumsbeing reduced depending on if you are an individual small businessor large employer by as much as 20 percent 11 percent or 3 percentnot to mention of course that you will also increase the number ofpeople who will be covered under thisThe present situation runs the risk of bringing our economy to itsknees if we dont act Recommitting this billgoing back in a sensewould roll the clock back and do great damage to both individuals andto our country economically That vote in 2005 set us back terribly inthis country This proposal allows us to move forward and provide thecoverage a lot of people needI thank my colleague  President I ask unanimous consent if I may that I beallowed to speak for 15 minutes and that that time include a colloquywith my colleague the Senator from Minnesota I wish to address a coupleissues if I may one is this debate about Medicare cuts and savingsLet me put up one chart I will not spend a long time on this but Iwish to make a point to my colleaguesAbout a year ago the Bush administration sent us a budget Accordingto the Congressional Budget Office and the Senate Budget Committee theproposals in the Bush administrations budget in the last year alonecalled for 481 billion in Medicare savings and cuts It was not in thecontext of a health care bill that was part of a budget proposal Thatwas 481 billion according to the CBO just last year Literally 12months ago that was the proposal In the context of the overall reformof the health care system in which we are trying to achieve savings tomake sure the dollars are going to go further and go for the thingsthat are needed our proposal calls for 380 billion in savings overthe coming 10 yearsI think again people need to understand what we are talking aboutand that is the difference So a year ago 481 billion and no healthcare proposaljust to get to budget proposals Here we are in thecontext of over 10 years of trying to put things in this bill to ensurea more solid footingThe National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicarerepresenting millions of our fellow citizens wrote a letter to theSenate every Member dated December 1 2009 Senator Harkin earlierput the entire letter in the Record I am going to read just onesentence from the letter signed by Barbara Kennelly the President andCEO of this organizationNot a single penny of the savings in the Senate billThis bill we are debatingwill come out of the pockets of beneficiaries in thetraditional Medicare programThis is an organization that does not bear a political label Itdoesnt represent Democrats Republicans Independents It merelyspends every hour of every working day assessing what happens to SocialSecurity and Medicare That is all they doall they do Believe mewhen I tell my colleagues this organization would not make a statementsuch as this if it were untrue I know the organization I know thepeople involved They are highly critical of Democrats and have beenwhen they think we have gone too far in various areas They statecategorically what this bill does to MedicareI ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be printed in theRecordThere being no objection the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record as followsNational Committee To PreserveSocial Security and MedicareWashington DC December 1 2009US SenateWashington DCDear Senator On behalf of the millions of members andsupporters of the National Committee to Preserve SocialSecurity and Medicare I am writing to express our oppositionto the amendment offered by Senator MCCain which wouldrecommit HR 3590 the Patient Protection and AffordableCare Act to the Senate Finance Committee with instructionsto remove important Medicare provisionsMuch of the rhetoric from opponents of health care reformis intended to frighten our nations seniors by persuadingthem that Medicare will be cut and their benefits reduced sothat they too will oppose this legislation The fact is thatHR 3590 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Actdoes not cut Medicare benefits rather it includes provisionsto ensure that seniors receive highquality care and the bestvalue for our Medicare dollars This legislation makesimportant improvements to Medicare which are intended tomanage costs by improving the delivery of care and toeliminate wasteful spendingThe National Committee opposes any cuts to Medicarebenefits Protecting the Medicare program along with SocialSecurityhas been our key mission since our founding 25 years ago andremains our top priority today In fact these programs arecritical lifelines to todays retirees and we believe theywill be even more important to future generations But wealso know that the cost of paying for seniors health carekeeps rising even with Medicare paying a large portion ofthe bill That is why we at the National Committee supportsavings in the Medicare program that will help lower costsWringing out fraud waste and inefficiency in Medicare iscritical for both the federal government and for everyMedicare beneficiaryThe Senate bill attempts to slow the rate of growth inMedicare spending by two to three percent or not quite 500billion over the next 10 years However it is important toremember that the program will continue growing during thistime Medicare will be spending increasing amounts of moneyand providers will be receiving increased reimbursementsona per capita basis every one of those years for a total ofalmost 9 trillion over the entire decade Even with thesavings in the Senate bill we will still be spending moremoney per beneficiary on Medicare in the coming decadesthough not quite as much as we would be spending if the billfails to passAmericas seniors have a major stake in the health carereform debate as the skyrocketing costs of health care areespecially challenging for those on fixed incomes Not asingle penny of the savings in the Senate bill will come outof the pockets of beneficiaries in the traditional Medicareprogram The Medicare savings inclued in HR 3590 thePatient Protection and Affordable Care Act will positivelyimpact millions of Medicare beneficiaries by slowing the rateof increase in outofpocket costs and improving benefitsand it will extend the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund byfive years To us this is a winwin for seniors and theMedicare programThe National Committee urges you to oppose the motion torecommit the bill to the Finance Committee with instructionsto strike important Medicare provisions from health carereform legislationCordiallyBarbara B KennellyPresident  CEO Thirdly I wish to commend our colleague from MarylandSenator Mikulski Again a lot has been said about her proposal dealingwith womens health Consider these two statistics as we try to getthis right Less than half the women in the United States have theoption of obtaining health insurance through a jobless than halfThey are forced either to purchase expensive insurance in theindividual market or are dependent upon a spouse to provide healthcareRight now today whether you are a Democrat Republicanconservative liberal whether you live in Connecticut Texas orMinnesota consider this A healthy 22yearold woman can be chargedinsurance rates 150 percent higher than a 22yearold man in a similarcondition Our bill before us ends thatends that If you defeat theMikulski amendment or recommit this bill remember tonight or tomorrowwhen the vote occurs that 22yearold woman and that 22yearold manhave a differential as much as 150 percent in health care premiumsThat is what happens at this very hour The Mikulski amendment changesthat as well in our bill among other thingsLastlyand then I wish to turn to my colleague from Minnesotajustto remind my colleagues again what Senator Baucus has done with hiscommittee in the Finance Committee and what we did in the HELPCommittee to provide some meaningful advantages and help to peopleacross this country immediately One our bill will provide 5 billionin immediate Federal support for a new program to provide affordablecoverage to uninsured Americans with preexisting conditions Coverageunder this program will continue until the new exchanges are operatingover the next few yearsSecondly the bill creates immediate access to reinsurance foremployer health care plans providing coverage for early retireesAgain this will help protect coverage while reducing premiums foremployers and their retireesThe bill also reduces the size of the doughnut hole immediately byraising the ceiling in initial coverage by 500 in 2010 the comingyearimmediately This will guarantee a 50percent price discount onbrandname drugs and biologics purchased by low and middleincomebeneficiaries in the coverage gap That is immediateFourth our bill will offer tax credits immediately to smallbusinesses to make employee coverage more affordable That is not ayear or two or three from now this is immediate Tax credits of up to50 percent of premiums will be available to firms that choose to offerthe coverage as a result of the tax breakFifth our bill will require insurers to permit children to stay onfamily policies until age 26 Right now that ends at 23 Our billextends it to 26 immediately to have this benefit for people acrossthe country who have families and children today who are staying homelonger because of the absence of jobs out there for themOur bill will provide coverage for prevention and wellness benefitsimmediately and exempt these benefits from deductibles and other costsharing requirements in public and private insurance coverage Not in ayear not 2 years not 3 years but immediately when this bill becomeslawSixth the bill would prohibit insurers from imposing lifetime limitson benefits and will restrict annual limits as wellThe bill also would prohibit group health plans from establishingeligibility rules of health care coverage that have the effect ofdiscriminating in favor of higher wage employeesIn this bill we also establish standards for insurance overhead toensure that premiums are spent on health benefits We also requirepublic disclosure of overhead and benefit spending and require premiumrebates from insurers that exceed established standards for overheadexpensesLastly it would create new Web sites to provide information on afacilitated form of consumer choice of insurance options And there areother immediate benefits to this legislationI think it is important as we discuss the bill that you understandthere are substantial and meaningful improvements We have debated thisbill and debated these issues for months and months on end The timehas come to act That is what we are proposing with this legislationWith that I appreciate the indulgence of my colleague fromMinnesota I yield to him for any additional comments he may wish tomake  I suspect weare going to have a lot of time to talk about the billI appreciate the comments of my colleague from Minnesota
S_MD_MIKULSKI,2009-12-01, President as we debate health care reform we needto recognize in the United States of America that health care is awomens issue Health care reform is a mustdo womens issue andhealth insurance reform must be a mustchange womens issueToo often when we look at when health care is even available to uswe face discrimination We face continually the punitive practices ofinsurance companies that charge women more and give us less in abenefit A 25yearold woman pays more for health insurance than hermale counterpart of the same health status A 40yearold woman paysalmost 35 percent more for her insurance than a male of the same agesame health status We want to change that in health care reform Wewant to end the punitive practices of the private insurance companiesin their gender discriminationWe the women of the Senate are concerned that even being a woman isbeing viewed by the insurance companies as a preexisting conditionNow we have the opportunity to change the law and change thedirection of health care I have offered an amendment to expand thescreening and preventive services available to women in order to saveour lives make sure our lives are not impaired as we get older and atthe same time be able to save money We know early detection saveslives curtails the expansion of disease and in the long run savesmoneyThere are certain killers of women the dread c word cancerbreast cancer ovarian cancer cervical cancer that are unique to wewomen Then there is the dread disease of lung cancer that affects menand women but is emerging as a main killer of women Then there is theother issue of heart disease and vascular disease We know for yearswomen were often left out of the research on heart disease For yearswomens heart disease went undetected and unrecognized because oursymptoms are different We can change this lawIn my amendment we expand the key preventive services for women andwe do it in a way that is based on recommendations from the Centers forDisease Control and from HRSA It will be based on the benefit packageavailable to Federal employees It means if our amendment passes thewomen of America will have the same access to preventive and screeningservices as the women of Congress What is good enough for a UnitedStates Senator should be good enough for any woman in the United Statesof AmericaThat is why we ask not only the women to join us but the good men ofquality who support us We know people such as Senator Dodd SenatorReid Senator Baucus men of quality never fear we women who seekequality They have raced for the cure as long and as hard as we haveand have fought for mammogram standards This is why we are wearingpink today Pink is the universal color that says while we race for thecure we want to have access to it when we find it But to have accessto the cure we are going to need to have access to mammograms to beable to get that diagnosis and then we are going to have to havehealth insurance to be able to pay for the treatment we haveThis is the Titanic battle we have today Are we going to have accessto health insurance and are we going to have access to these preventiveservicesWe do know in the area of heart disease and cancer and silentundetected killers such as diabetes it is often undetected Whathappens is for many women they do not get that early detection andscreening No 1 because they cant afford it They cant afford itbecause they either dont have health insurance and there are otherdemands on their family or No 2 when they go if they do haveinsurance they find their benefit might not be covered So many ofthese benefits are based on State mandates but worse than that it isthe copayments and high deductiblesMany women say Well my insurance company provides for it but thiscopayment and deductible I have to choose between my childrens shoesor my deductible We want to eithereliminate or shrink those deductibles and eliminate that high barrierthat overwhelming hurdle that prevents women from having access tothese early detection and screening programsMuch is being debated about mammograms We believe access tomammograms should be universal universal access But the decision onwhether to get one should be made with your doctor Well that is greatto say but you need to have access to your doctor You need to nothave to overcome the high hurdle of deductions or copayments to be ableto do itWe know mammogram screenings decrease breast cancer by over 40percent Regular pap smears reduce cervical cancer by 40 percent Thisyear 4000 women will die of cervical cancer Then lets take thedread but often overlooked diabetic screening Diabetes is theunderlying cause of twothirds of chronic illness in both younger andolder women If we find it early and get everybody in the rightprogram they are going to be able to get the treatment they need sothey dont lose an eye they dont lose a kidney they dont lose alegWe cant lose any more time We need to provide universal access tohealth care to the American people and we need to make sure they haveaccess to the screening and early preventive actions that will savelivesMr President I urge the adoption of the Mikulski amendment and Ithank you for your leadership on this issueI ask unanimous consent that the remaining time be equally dividedbetween Governor Shaheen Senator Hagan Senator Murray and SenatorGillibrandThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Dodd Without objection it is soorderedWho seeks recognitionThe Senator from New Hampshire  Madam President that concludes our discussion and ourresponses to this portion of the health care reform billI must say Alert alert alert We have just been informed that ashrill advocacy group is spreading lies about this amendment They aresaying that because it is prevention it includes abortion servicesThere are no abortion services included in the Mikulski amendment Itis screening for diseases that are the biggest killers for womenthesilent killers of women It also provides family planningbut familyplanning as recognized by other acts Please no more lies Lets getoff of it and save lives
S_MT_BAUCUS,2009-12-03,  President I wonder if the Senator from Wyoming wouldbe available to answer a question Is it true the CBO letters say the Senate bill will extend the lifeextend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund Is that true  Madam President I yield myself 212 minutes from thetime under the control of the managersFor the benefit of all Senators I want to take a moment to lay outtodays programThe time between now and 1145 is for debate on the amendment by theSenator from Maryland Ms Mikulski the chairwoman of the Subcommitteeon Retirement and Aging of the Health Education Labor and PensionsCommitteeAnd at the same time we will debate the sidebyside amendment bythe Senator from Alaska Ms MurkowskiAt 1145 the Senate will conduct two backtoback rollcall votes onthe two amendments first on the amendment by the Senator fromMaryland and second on the amendment by the Senator from AlaskaThereafter we will conduct approximately 2 hours of debate on theMCCain motion to commit on Medicare and the sidebyside amendment bythe Senator from Colorado Mr BennetAt 245 the Senate will conduct two backtoback votes on theamendment by the Senator from Colorado followed by a vote on themotion to commit by the Senator from ArizonaThereafter we expect to turn to another Democratic firstdegreeamendment and another Republican firstdegree amendmentThis is the fourth day on this bill and we are only late thismorning coming to our first vote Even for the US Senate this is aslow paceI note that some have made plans for delaying this bill in even moreextreme fashion As the majority leader noted on Tuesday one Senatorcirculated a list of delaying tactics available under the Senate rulesI presume all Senators know the Senates rules already So to sendthe letter leaves the impression that that Senator would like to urgeSenators to use some of the delaying tactics stated in the memoBut I urge a more cooperative course Out of courtesy to otherSenators who desire to offer amendments I urge my colleagues to allowus to reach unanimous consent agreements to order the voting of futureamendments in a more timely fashion That is simply the only way thatwe can ensure that more colleagues will have the time and opportunityto offer and debate their amendmentsI thank all SenatorsThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator has consumed his time I ask unanimous consent that the order of December 2 bemodified to delete all after the word tableThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Without objection it is soordered I ask unanimous consent that the debate time from 2 to245 this afternoon be divided as follows in the order listed thefirst 1712 minutes under the control of Senator MCCain or hisdesignee the next 17 minutes under the control of Senator Baucus orhis designee and the final 10 minutes 5 minutes each for SenatorMCCain and Senator Bennet of ColoradoThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Without objection it is soorderedThe Senator from Iowa   Madam President will the Senator yield for a quickinquiry to my friend from Wyoming  Madam President I might inquire of my colleague fromWyoming if that item the Senator was quoting from about costs in theWall Street Journal was a news article or an editorial  Well I do not knowto be totally fair and respectful toone of my very best friends in the Senateto cover that point isntit also true the Congressional Budget Office said in the second 10years this bill will reduce the budget by onequarter percent of GDPIsnt that also true according to the Congressional Budget Office  President I am going to speak very briefly on thepending subject and then let the sponsor of the amendment that is theMikulski amendment finish up here I think it is very tellingI knowthis point has been made before but I think it bears repeatingtheAmerican Heart Association American Stroke Association has written andreleased to the Senate this letter I will read the most important parthere Basically they say they strongly support requiring health plansand Medicare providing first dollar coverage for clinical preventiveservices that are evidence based and necessary for the prevention orearly detection of an illness or disability We all agree with thatThey go on then to comment on the Murkowski amendment saying theyappreciate the Murkowski amendment recognized the value of the guidanceand recommendations but they go on to say that even these guidelinesmust be held to a standard of being evidence basedI might say I run across this over and over again in the medicalprofessionmedical experts We need to keep moving more and moretoward evidencebased medicineThis statement from the American Heart Association American StrokeAssociation goes on to sayIn addition we are concerned that Senator Murkowskispreventive health services amendment would take a stepbackwards by substituting the judgment of the independentUS Preventive Services Task Force with the judgment ofprivate health insurance companiesFrankly it is a point I very much agree with I dont think we wantthe judgment of private health insurance companies making thesedecisions I think it is appropriate the sponsor of the amendmentfinish She is doing a very good job  That iswhat the letter saysThank you  I dont have the letter in front of me but in alldeference and respect to my good friend from Wyoming the CBO says theexact opposite It is the conclusion of the Congressional Budget Officethat this legislation will help seniors by extending the solvency ofthe Medicare trust fund by I guess 4 to 5 years That is black andwhite If I had the letter in front of me I could read it to him butthat is afact This legislation will extend the solvency of the Medicare trustfund by another 5 yearsSo instead of being insolvent in the year 2017 under thislegislation that is extended to the year 2022 That is a fact Atleast the fact is that is what CBO concludes in their letter That is afactSecond as a caring physician does the Senator think that we as acountry should try to find a way to provide health insurance for somany Americanssome of them lower incomewho dont have healthinsurance in our country Because after all we are the onlyindustrialized country in the world that doesnt find a way to makesure its citizens have health insuranceAs a physician who sees patients many of whom cant pay their billsand defer medical treatment because they do not have health insuranceI am wondering if the Senator believes this country should try to finda way where its citizens have health insurance  I will ask this question and then I will finish becauseI know my colleagues want to speakOne of the basic underpinnings of this legislation is that we shouldchange the way we reimburse providers moving away from quantity andvolume and more toward quality I am curiousand this is not anantagonistic question I am just trying to get a physicians point ofview because so many doctors I talk to think that although it creates alittle uncertainty probably that is the right thing to doto move ourreimbursing based on quality coordinated care and focusing on thepatient rather than our current system which reimburses more onquantity and the number of services provided et ceteraIs that something the Senator thinks we should pursue in thiscountry   My colleagueswant to speak but I think it is worth repeating over and over againThis legislation is designed to retain the uniquely American solutionto health careroughly half public half private It is designed tomake sure patients can still as they should choose their own doctorany doctor they wantprimary care doc specialist no gatekeepers andall that stuff The doctors are totally free and should be free to maketheir own decisions after consultation with their patients as to whatprocedure makes sense or doesnt make senseIn addition to that frankly more competition with the exchangesThis legislation frankly is rooted almost entirely on maintaining thecurrent free market system in health care There is some insurancemarket reform which I think everybody agrees with which is denyingpreexisting conditions as a basis for denying coverage and there is amodest expansion of Medicaid for lower income people who just cant gethealth care but otherwise this is legislation which is rooted in thecurrent American systemWe have a good system It works This is just designed to make itwork a little better by making sure it reimburses as the Senator fromWyoming wants based more on quality He didnt mention this but Iknow he agrees also insurance market reform so those patients who cometo him dont have to wait until the end of the year in the future asthey have in the pastBut I want to get it very clear this is no government takeoverThat is a scare tactic It is not accurate It is basically maintainingour current systemI would now like to yield 10 minutes to my good friend from Vermont  President I ask how much time is remaining on eachside President I yield 9 minuteshow many seconds  President I do not think I have any time but I askunanimous consent that as to the time I do have after 2 oclock I cantake 2 minutes of that so I can ask a question of my good friend fromIowa President I might ask my friend from Iowa SenatorGrassley a question if he is available for a question I am takingtime    Is it true the Congressional Budget Office said thisbill over 10 years is not only deficit neutral but actually decreasesthe budget deficit by about 130 billion Is that true Is that whatthe Congressional Budget Office said   Reserving the right to object under current law if lessis spent for Medicare providers the benefits inure to the Medicaretrust fund beneficiariesAlthough I have the greatest respect for the Senator from Iowa thisis a stunt and I object  The Senator fromTennessee says this is going to hurt seniors Lets ask the seniororganizations what they think about thatLets also look at this organization called 60 Plus What does theAARP say in the letter to Senator Reid dated December 2 It talksabout this legislationThe legislation before the Senate properly focuses onprovider reimbursement reforms   I am sorry all my colleagues have fled the Senate I would like forthem to stay and listen to this I would like to hear their responseBut they have just fled the Senate after making sound bites  The AARP letter dated December 2statesThe legislation before the Senate properly focuses onprovider reimbursement reforms   Most importantly the legislation does not reduce anyguaranteed Medicare benefitsThat is AARP All this is scare talk about grandma With all duerespect to my friend from Tennessee he says that He has been usingthat phrase a lot But AARP says that grandma is fine AARP saysMost importantly the legislation does not reduce anyguaranteed Medicare benefitsIt doesnt reduce any benefits according to AARP Going onAARP believes that savings can be found in Medicare   The savings in Medicare will extend the solvency of Medicare I amsure my friend from Tennessee knows the actuary said this legislationextends the solvency of Medicare helps Medicare The benefits go onlonger than the status quo Also it does so according to AARP byeliminating waste and inefficiency and aggressively rooting out fraudand abuse The last sentence isWe therefore urge you to oppose the MCCain amendment torecommit   The AARP says this hurts seniors the MCCain motion to commit Ithink the job of the AARP is to figure out what is best for seniorsThat is their conclusionIt is not just AARPs view There is another letter This is from theNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare They saybasically this legislation doesnt cut Medicare benefits Again thisis the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and MedicareThey say rather this legislation includes provisions to ensure thatseniors receive highquality care and the best value for their Medicaredollars That is a very reputable senior organization AARP is a veryreputable senior organization The National Committee to PreserveSocial Security and Medicare is a very reputable organization That iswhat they sayWho is this 60 Plus association I have heard referred to Let me justtell my colleagues what 60 Plus really is I will read this This isfrom Wikipedia and it may not be accurate It says this about 60 PlusThe 60 Plus Association is an American conservativeadvocacy group based in Arlington Virginia that billsitself as the conservatives alternative to the AARPThat makes good sense because over the years it has sought toprivatize Social Security 60 Plus over the years has sought toprivatize Social Security They want to end the Federal estate taxThey also want to strengthen gun rights but that is not relevantAccording to the AARPAnd this is a bit biasedthe 60 Plus Association employed the talents of conservativedirect mail mogul Richard A Viguerie to solicit new membersWe all know who Viguerie is 60 Plus is a very conservativeorganization I dont think they are real interested in seniorcitizens They have different fish to fry Also AARP criticized 60Plus as being partisan because its issues and causes mirror those ofonly one of two major parties the Republican PartyA final criticism leveled by the AARP about 60 Plus isthat because it lists no duespaying members and get thisreceives the majority of its contributions from thepharmaceutical industry the group is simply a frontorganization for the pharmaceutical industryI ask unanimous consent to have these letters in opposition to theMCCain amendment in support of the Bennet amendment and the Wikipediainformation printed in the RecordThere being no objection the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record as followsAlliance for Retired AmericansWashington DC December 1 2009Dear Senator The Alliance for Retired Americans on behalfof its nearly four million members throughout the nationopposes the motion by Senator John MCCain to commit thePatient Protection and Affordable Care America Act HR3590 to the Finance Committee We urge its prompt defeat bythe SenateThe MCCain motion to commit would seriously undermineimportant substantive and positive changes in the healthcare needs of older Americans contained in the bill nonemore important than proposed Medicare improvements In factthe MCCain motion would increase health care burdens onMedicare beneficiaries in several instances The MCCainmotion would for the first time subject Medicare Part Dprescription drug premiums to means testing causing a risein premiums for many older Americans In addition the motionto commit would halt indexing to Medicare Part B physiciansservices premiums causing even more seniors to pay higherpremiums which currently can be as much as 300 per monthFurthermore the MCCain motion would continue the wastefulMedicare Advantage overpayments that currently threaten thefinancial stability of the Medicare Trust FundThe Alliance supports provisions in the Patient Protectionand Affordable Care Act that improve health care for olderAmericans such as allowing Medicare beneficiaries to keeptheir choice of doctors lowering prescription drug costseliminating copayments for preventive screenings expandingaccess to longterm supports and service and providingassistance for preMedicare eligible early retirees All ofthese improvements will not be possible should the MCCainmotion passThe legislation does not cut Medicare benefits With theexpected rising costs of Medicare the legislation slows therate of the programs growth without reducing benefits TheMCCain motion would actually undercut fiscally responsibleattempts to meet the challenges of providing health care forolder AmericansThe Alliance for Retired Americans is committed to enactinglegislation that improves the quality of life for retireesand all Americans Defeat of the MCCain motion to commit thePatient Protection and Affordable Care Act to the FinanceCommittee will directly benefit our members and more thanforty million older Americans If we can be of assistanceplease contact Richard Fiesta Director of Government andPolitical Affairs at the AllianceSincerely yoursBarbara J EasterlingPresidentRuben BurksSecretaryTreasurerEdward F CoyleExecutive DirectorAARPWashington DC December 2 2009Hon Harry ReidMajority Leader US SenateWashington DCDear Leader Reid AARP supports moving forward on healthcare reform and we remain committed to enacting legislationthis year that protects and strengthens Medicare improvesthe delivery of health care and provides affordable insurancefor all Accordingly we oppose the amendment offered bySenator MCCain to recommit HR 3590 to the Senate FinanceCommitteeAs we have said from the outset AARP supports a balance ofrevenues and savings with shared responsibility fromindividuals employers and the government With respect toMedicare AARP supports policies to eliminate waste fraudand abuseand to improve the quality value andsustainability of the program for current and futurebeneficiaries The legislation before the Senate properlyfocuses on provider reimbursement reforms to achieve theseimportant policy objectives Most importantly thelegislation does not reduce any guaranteed Medicare benefitsAARP believes that savings can be found in Medicare throughsmart targeted changes aimed at improving health caredelivery eliminating waste and inefficiency andaggressively weeding out fraud and abuse Such changes willhelp strengthen Medicares longterm financing withoutincreasing costs for beneficiaries that make health care lessaffordable Medicare provides critical health security toolder Americans and it is important that Medicare continueto deliver high quality care As health care costs includingMedicare costs continue to skyrocket it is essential thatwe make changes to improve health care delivery improveMedicares financing and ensure maximum value for ourMedicare dollars We believe that Medicare changes in thisbill begin to move us down this path without reducingguaranteed Medicare benefitsWith these savings the legislation before the Senate takesimportant steps to improve access to preventive services forMedicare beneficiaries However more should be done tostrengthen Medicareincluding closing the Medicare Part Dcoverage gap or doughnut hole as pledged by thePresidentWe therefore urge you to oppose the MCCain amendment torecommit and we remain firmly committed to working with youto strengthen Medicare and enact comprehensive health carereform this year that improves access and affordability ofhealth care for allSincerelyAddison Barry RandNational Committee to PreserveSocial Security and MedicareWashington DC December 3 2009US SenateWashington DCDear Senator On behalf of the National Committee toPreserve Social Security and Medicares millions of membersand supports I am pleased to endorse the amendment ofSenator Michael Bennet of Colorado which clarifies that HR3590 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act wouldimprove the Medicare program as part of health care reformSenator Bennets amendment puts into law two of the mostimportant criteria the National Committee has been using whenanalyzing health care reform proposals First it statesexplicitly that the legislation would not reduce any ofMedicares guaranteed benefits Second it ensures thatsavings from Medicare would be used to improve MedicareImprovements in HR 3590 include extending the solvency ofthe Medicare trust funds by five years reducing the amountof future increases in premiums eliminating costsharing forpreventive benefits making prescription drugs moreaffordable and ensuring access to Medicare providersProtecting Medicare and Social Security has been theNational Committees key mission since our founding 27 yearsago and remains our top priority today Our members are nodifferent than seniors all over this country who are nervousabout rising outofpocket health care costs and areconcerned about the Medicare savings in health care reformlegislation This is a legitimate concern but it isimportant to put these savingsin perspective The federal government will spend almost 9trillion on Medicare in the next decade The proposed savingsof nearly 500 billion mean that the growth in spending willbe reduced by about two percent over the next 10 years byeliminating wasteful spending and outright fraudThe HR 3590 the Patient Protection and Affordable CareAct includes savings that are designed to protect Medicarebeneficiaries and improve the Medicare program SenatorBennets amendment expressly prohibits any reductions inguaranteed Medicare benefits and makes sure all savings arereinvested back into Medicare I urge you to support theBennet amendment which is important to Medicare beneficiariesand the solvency of the Medicare programCordiallyBarbara B KennellyPresident  CEONational Committee to PreserveSocial Security and MedicareWashington DC December 1 2009US SenateWashington DCDear Senator On behalf of the millions of members andsupporters of the National Committee to Preserve SocialSecurity and Medicare I am writing to express our oppositionto the amendment offered by Senator MCCain which wouldrecommit HR 3590 the Patient Protection and AffordableCare Act to the Senate Finance Committee with instructionsto remove important Medicare provisionsMuch of the rhetoric from opponents of health care reformis intended to frighten our nations seniors by persuadingthem that Medicare will be cut and their benefits reduced sothat they too will oppose this legislation The fact is thatHR 3590 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Actdoes not cut Medicare benefits rather it includes provisionsto ensure that seniors receive highquality care and the bestvalue for our Medicare dollars This legislation makesimportant improvements to Medicare which are intended tomanage costs by improving the delivery of care and toeliminate wasteful spendingThe National Committee opposes any cuts to Medicarebenefits Protecting the Medicare program along with SocialSecurity has been our key mission since our funding 25 yearsago and remains our top priority today In fact theseprograms are critical lifelines to todays retirees and webelieve they will be even more important to futuregenerations But we also know that the cost of paying forseniors health care keeps rising even with Medicare payinga large portion of the bill That is why we at the NationalCommittee support savings in the Medicare program that willhelp lower costs Wringing out fraud waste and inefficiencyin Medicare is critical for both the federal government andfor every Medicare beneficiaryThe Senate bill attempts to slow the rate of growth inMedicare spending by two to three percent or not quite 500billion over the next 10 years However it is important toremember that the program will continue growing during thistime Medicare will be spending increasing amounts of moneyand providers will be receiving increased reimbursementsona per capita basis every one of those years for a total ofalmost 9 trillion over the entire decade Even with thesavings in the Senate bill we will still be spending moremoney per beneficiary on Medicare in the coming decadesthough not quite as much as we would be spending if the billfails to passAmericas seniors have a major stake in the health carereform debate as the skyrocketing costs of health care areespecially challenging for those on fixed incomes Not asingle penny of the savings in the Senate bill will come outof the pockets of beneficiaries in the traditional Medicareprogram The Medicare savings included in HR 3590 thePatient Protection and Affordable Care Act will positivelyimpact millions of Medicare beneficiaries by slowing the rateof increase in outofpocket costs and improving benefitsand it will extend the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund byfive years To us this is a winwin for seniors and theMedicare programThe National Committees urges you to oppose the motion torecommit the bill to the Finance Committee with instructionsto strike important Medicare provisions from health carereform legislationCordiallyBarbara B KennellyPresident  CEO60 Plus AssociationFrom WikipediaThe 60 Plus Association is an American

the ad was largely false and usedscare tactics to discourage voters from backing reformTo publicize the ads launch 60 Plus issued a press releasetitled Massive Medicare Cuts Await Elderly Says New Ad FromSeniors Group that read in part     The healthcareproposal touted by the Obama Administration means massiveMedicare cuts in order to pay for healthcare reform 60Plus provided no evidence of these supposed massiveMedicare cuts President I think it is pretty clear that the mainorganizations that care about seniors support this bill Anotherorganization60 PlusI dont know what they think I guess theyoppose it because they want to privatize Social Security and they getmost of the money from the pharmaceutical industry I dont think theycare about senior citizens frankly and certainly not as much as theseother organizationsI think it is also important to point out that this legislation isdeficit neutral over not just the first 10 years but over the next 10years It is more than deficit neutral This legislation generates a130 billion surplus the first 10 years and as we all know reducesthe budget by a quarter of GDP over the next 10 years So this is notirresponsible it is very fiscally responsible It is stronglysupported by the senior organizations that care for seniors I mightsay too it is not raiding Medicare at all It is strengthening theMedicare trust fund and it extends the solvency of the trust fundTherefore I think clearly as AARP says we should oppose theMCCain amendment which hurts Social Security beneficiaries does nothelp themI yield such time as the Senator from Illinois needs  President I think it is appropriate to remind peopleof some of the provisions that are in this billTo repeat because some people have listened to some of this debateand some have not and some might be tuning in right now the fact iswithout reform without this legislation Medicare is expected to gobroke in the next 8 years That is according to the Medicare trusteesreport With this legislation that is extended for at least 5 moreyears That protects seniors This legislation protects seniorsWithout reform that is without this bill costs will rise and seniorswill be forced to bear more and more of the burden out of their ownpockets This legislation adds benefits for seniors It does not takeit away as the other side impliesWithout reform seniors will struggle to afford prescriptions in thedoughnut hole I remind my colleagues that this legislation will cutthe cost of brandname prescription drugs in half for seniors duringthat gap the socalled doughnut holeIt will also help provide more benefits in terms of annual wellnessvisits When seniors go to the doctor for a colonoscopy mammographyor other preventive screenings they will not have copays as iscurrently the case today That is an added benefit this legislationprovides for seniorsAlso this legislation helps seniors who are eligible for bothMedicare and Medicaid with access to home communitybasedalternatives A lot of our seniors would like that additional benefitThat is all in this legislationThis legislation provides more benefits for seniors not fewer Thislegislation protects seniors it does not harm them This legislationextends the solvency of the trust fund rather than notI might also sayand I think the Senator from Illinois made a verygood pointcurrently seniors who are paying a Part B premium arereally paying a 90 tax per year for those persons who are in MedicareAdvantage We know Medicare Advantage is overpaid The Senator fromOklahoma Mr Coburn agreed with me when I asked him just yesterday ifMedicare Advantage was overpaid He said yes it is overpaid by a verylarge margin This legislation can adjust that overpaymentI might also say too that the groups I mentioned support thislegislation But the main point I want to make is this There are somany fundamental provisions in this legislation that really have notcome out much in debate a little esoteric but under the heading ofdelivery system reform We must begin to change the way wereimburse doctors and hospitals so we are focusing much more on qualityof care rather than quantity of care Some of that is already happeningin America without legislation Basically it is the nature ofintegrated systems We all talked about them I know Senators on theother side of the aisle also agree with this new trend where hospitalsdoctors nursing homes and other groups get together and theycoordinate their care Their care is much more patient focused We haveto move much more in that directionThis will go a long way once it starts kicking init is going totake maybe 3 or 4 years to finally have an effecttoward eliminatingthe waste in our current system Estimates are we have between 200billion to 300 billion to 800 billion annually in waste in theAmerican health care system That is the reason health care costs areso high for family businesses governments whatnot We have to beginto get that under control and this legislation does thatIf we do not pass this legislation we will be postponing the daywhen we have to begin to get some of these excessive costs undercontrol and then the problem will be much more difficult An ounce ofprevention is worth a pound of cure in medicine It is also true inlegislation Clearly now is thetime to exercise a little ounce of prevention by starting to curbexcessive costs and this bill does that   When I was toldabout the handbook that is what I thought I was going to do is callup Medicare and say that is misleading and it is inaccurate because itis misleading and it is inaccurate   How much time remains Wemight as well yield back our time and we can vote  President I ask my colleague if he wishes to gofirst Whatever he wants to do It is his motion  Unless we acttoday and pass health care reform the Medicare trust fund runs out ofmoney in 2017 There are two ways to keep Medicare solvent findefficiencies so Medicare spends less or increase revenues going intothe trust fundtwo ideas Our bill would make Medicare Advantage moreefficient We would introduce competitive bidding We extend the trust fund for 5 more years That is in this bill YesMedicare Advantage plans would not be overpaid as much but those planscould pay for greater efficiency by cutting their profits or cuttingtheir executives pay They could do that Nothing says they have to goafter beneficiariesOur bill does nothing to reduce the guaranteed Medicare benefits Tothe contrary our bill would improve Medicare benefits It would helpseniors on the prescription drug doughnut hole and add new preventivebenefits such as annual wellness visits The bill would help ensuredoctors would be available to treat Medicare patients We would preventthe 21percent cut in doctor payments under current law For all thosereasons the American Association of Retired Persons supports reformand opposes the MCCain motionI urge my colleagues to support reform and oppose the motion tocommit   With great considerable administrative costs and profitsthat otherwise could go to seniors    Madam President I think it would be instructive to stopall this rhetorical talking past each other on Medicare Advantage andexplain a little bit about how we got to where we are in thislegislationI dont know the exact year but I think it was back in the 1980ssometime up to a certain point Medicare was basically paid fees forservices That is the basic Medicare model The service was providedand there are certain set rates for that service Then in the 1980sprivate companies thought maybe they could be more efficient privateinsurance companies So they came to Congress and said We can do abetter job in compensating Medicare based on fee for service so letsset up something called Medicare Advantage private entitiesSo Congress said OK competition is a good thing So we did thatCongress did that We basically set the rates to be paid to MedicareAdvantage plans at 95 percent of fee for service After all the plansaid they could do it more cheaply and they could compete So we saidOK that sounds like a good idea We will pay you 95 percent of whatotherwise would be paid under fee for service That continued for awhileIn 1997 the plan said Gee we need a little more money So Congresssaid All right And we gave a little more money to Medicare Advantageand basically said OK that will pay the 95 percent But if you arenot doing so well and making money at 95 we will set kind of a higherfloor according to certain areas of the country and you could choosewhatever enables you to have the greatest compensationThe big change occurred in 2003 in the Medicare Modernization Actotherwise known as the drug bill It was the legislation that createddrug benefits for seniors As we all know frankly when Medicare wascreated it didnt have an outpatient drug benefit because drugswerent comparatively as important then as they are today Today thereare miracle drugs that help in a lot of ways We created the drugbenefit in 2003The Congress did something else then Many Members of Congress wereconcerned that Medicare Advantage might not offer the plans in ruralparts of America that there wouldnt be enough incentive for MedicareAdvantage to go to rural America to offer the drug benefitsnot onlythe drug benefits but other benefits they provided Congress franklygave a lot of money to Medicare Advantage plans so there could be atleast two plans operating in all parts of the country Give them enoughmoney and they will go that was the theory Guess what happened Wegave them a lot of money and they wentWe have reached the point now where Medicare Advantage is byeverybodys estimate quite dramatically overpaid as the Senator fromOklahoma Mr Coburn said when I asked him yesterday whether MedicareAdvantage plans are overpaid He said Yes they are definitelyoverpaidMedPAC which advises us on Medicare reimbursement said to us thatwe are way overpaying Medicare Advantage plans I hear figures of from14 to 18 percent overpayment It depends on what part of the countryyou are in Lets be conservative and say it is 14 percent in fee forservice that they are overpaid MedPAC is an independent advisorygroup that helps us figure out what in the world we pay hospitalsnursing homes home health agencies etc We are not the experts Weneed help MedPAC said to the Congress that we are overpaying them bigtimeWe decided lets figure out a way to reform the system How about alittle competition Right now Medicare Advantage plans are paid whatis called a benchmark depending upon the fee for service in theircertain area We all know fee for service is much less in ruralAmerica and I am sure in the home State of the occupant of the chairFee for service is much higher in other more urban States and so forthAs it turned out under the benchmarks for fee for service they wereway overpaying in States where fee for service is so high and notquite as much overpaid where fee for service is so low That is a nuttysystem in the current law todayWhat we are doing in this legislation is basically we are sayingLook lets introduce a little competition We are saying Lets getrid of the benchmarktype fee for service It is out of whack indifferent parts of the country What are we going to do We say OK wewill divide the country into geographic areas In your area whereveryou might be Uncle Samor Medicarewill pay the average competitivebidfor that area The average cost you bid for that area is what we aregoing to pay which eliminates this big disparity between States andmakes it much more fair so that reimbursement is based much more onwhat it actually costs in a certain area but it is competitively bidThat is what we are trying to doIs that a good thing to do I think most of us think so Is itperfect I dont know for sure but we are trying our best to make thisa better system a better program than we currently have As aconsequence we are going to save some money and there will becompetition Most of us think competition is often a pretty good thingThat is what this is I remind my colleagues As a consequence we arenot going to be overpaying Medicare Advantage plans anymore The amountwe reduced the payment to is in line with what MedPAC says we shouldpay the Medicare Payment Advisory CommissionWe are trying to be responsible and reasonable with taxpayer moneyseniors who pay into Medicare The point is often made that gee thiswill hurt Medicare Advantage hospitals and so forth I think it isworth reminding all of us that a meeting occurred at the White House Ithink 4 to 6 months ago when all of the socalled providersthehospitals insurance companies including Medicare Advantage plansallgot together with the President and said Mr President we agree thiscountry needs health care reform They all agreedLets move back in history a little bit When President Clintonattempted health care reform all those groups were opposed to healthcare reform This time they are pretty much in favor of it becausethey know if we dont fix it it is going to collapseBack to that meeting What did they say They said Mr President wehave all gotten together and we think we can contribute We can cutcollectively 2 trillion in payments that go to us over the next 10yearsThat is what they said That is pretty interesting Thank you verymuch So we are working together to get health care reformWhy do you think they would agree to 2 trillion They got theircalculators out and got their financial officers together and saidGee if everybody has health careremember 46 million Americans donthave health insuranceif everybody had health insurance hospitalsMedicare Advantage plans said Hey we can make some money becauseeverybody has health insuranceSo that was the deal They will have a little lower margins but theywill make it up on volume That is why they said to the President Wecan cut 2 trillion that otherwise would be reimbursements to usIn this legislation did we reduce the rate of increase over 10 yearsby 2 trillion No Did we decrease the rate of increase inexpenditures by half of that or 1 trillion No Do we reduce the rateof increase of health care expenditures down to say 450 billionclose to 500 billion Yes that is what we did About onequarter ofthe industry said they could voluntarily contribute Are they squawkingtoday No Why Because they got a pretty good deal They know they cancontinue to provide services and the hospitals are going to do well andhome health care agencies will do well I will add that the profitmargin for home health agencies is about 17 percent That is prettygood So we are cutting them a little bit The profit margin fornursing homesMedicare payments to nursing homesis about 15 percentWe are cutting that a little bit But they are still making money andstill will do well In fact their average rate of growth over the next10 years is going to be in excess of 5 percent a year Wall Streetanalysts say these outfits are doing pretty well You dont see theirstocks going downWe are trying to do what is right and to reform Medicare Advantageas I just outlined it It is a pretty fair attempt at reform Also wewill reduce payments to hospitals and other providers in an amount thatthey can live withnot be happy with but an amount they are OK withand where they know they can still make money That extends thesolvency of the Medicare trust fund another 5 years because thoseproviders are not being paid as much as they would otherwise be paidI hear Senators crying crocodile tears about how seniors are going tobe cut and so forth Frankly with the changes we made I think it isvery fair and it will extend the solvency of the trust fund There isnot one dime of guaranteed Medicare benefits that will be cutnot onethin dimein this legislation It is true that because MedicareAdvantagethe rate of growth of increase in Medicare Advantage plansis trimmed back a little perhaps there will not be as many extrabenefitsnot the guaranteed benefits but extras fringe benefits likegym memberships and things like that Dont forget that is not becausethat is a decision made by Medicare or by Congress that is a decisionmade by the executive offices of these private companies I am notsaying they should do this They could trim salaries overhead andthey could have a little less return to stockholders and they couldcut down administrative costs There are various things they could dowhich doesnt have to be passed on to reductions in fringes Lets keepthings in perspective as to what is actually going on   To be totally fair the other side likesto trot out this Medicare pamphlet that includes Medicare Advantage Ithink that is misleading and not accurate As the Senator says theseare private plans    Under this legislation we sayfranklyunder the earlier Medicare Advantage plans HMOs had some coordinatedcare but the other half the private fee for service preferredprovider organizations did not have coordinated careWe are saying in the legislation that if you are in the MedicareAdvantage plan which includes a whole list and you providecoordinated care we are going to give you a bonus  When you see the operationaleffects as my good friend from Connecticut said  This legislation if I may say expressly states therewill be no reduction in what is called guaranteed benefits underMedicare No reduction whether it is under Medicare Advantage whetherit is under fee for servicewhatever it is no reduction whatsoeverTo be fair to my good friend I used the words guaranteedbenefits Guaranteed benefits are the usual benefits seniors think ofwhen they are under Medicare They go to a doctor hospital so onWe have given unfortunately so many additional dollars to the socalled Medicare Advantage plansway above what they should havereceived MedPAC agrees Senator Coburn totally agrees they have beenpaid way too much They have taken advantage of that advantage bygiving additional benefits in addition to the guaranteed benefitsThose additionals are things such as gym membershipsa lot of extrastuff that frankly is not part of Medicare is not directly relatedto healthI might say tooI have said this a couple three times and I willsay it againa reduction in the increase of payments to MedicareAdvantage the effect of those reductions is a decision made by theofficers of that company They could take those reductions and applythem anywhere They could reduce their salaries They could reducetheir admin costs They could take other actions that would reduce therate of growth the rate of return of their stockholders They do nothave to take it out of the beneficiaries That is their choice They donot have to That is according to analysis of Medicare Advantage plans fromOppenheimer Capital Fund dated November 12 of this year between 2006and 2009 Their estimate is Medicare Advantage accounted for nearly 75percent of the increase in gross profits among the larger Medicareplans in the industryLet me say this   Medicare Advantage    has been a huge driverQuoting from the Oppenheimer Capital Funda huge driver of earnings growth for the industry in recentyears Between 2006 and 2009 we estimate that MedicareAdvantage accounted for nearly 75 percent of the increase ingross profits among the larger plans in the industryhighlighted by an estimated gross profit increase of 19billion in 2009 relative to commercial risk earnings gainsThat is basic health insurance not Medicare Advantage plans butbasic health insuranceof nearly 600 million Medicare Advantage probably wont beas much of a contributor in 2009But it is going to be a very large contributor in 2009 because ofadvantages they get  I might add too to remind us all this legislationprovides additional benefits for all seniors including MedicareAdvantage recipientsadditional benefits What are they No copaymentfor certain preventive caremammograms for example colonoscopiesscreening benefits that are not in existence today There are a wholehost of other things that are additionalThis legislation provides additional benefits to Medicare Advantagemembers that are not there todayWhen I say guaranteed benefits I am talking about the usualbenefits seniors think of under Medicare It is hospital care it isnurses it is all medically necessary physician care diagnostictesting supplies It is home health care preventive care skillednursing hospiceall the things that are basically related to healthcareThe only thing that might be trimmed back a little is I call themthe fringe stuff the excesses such as gym memberships I wish I hadthe whole list because some of them are not relatedAs I said earlier they may not be cut They dont have to be It isup to the private companies whether to cut I have nothing againstcompanies making profits They should make profits It is ourresponsibility as Senators to make sure the reimbursement ratesMedicare pays providers are fair and reasonable and not excessive Wehave been told they are excessive So we are trying to find a way tomake it fairer  President I ask unanimous consent that the Committeeon Banking Housing and Urban Affairs be authorized to meet

S_DE_KAUFMAN,2009-12-03, President a few weeks ago the Department ofEducation released application guidelines for the Race to the Topcompetitive grant program I am very encouraged that these guidelinesinclude a competitive preference for science technology engineeringand mathematicsor STEMeducation I commend the Department for itsforesightThroughout the year I have spoken many times about how important afocus on science and engineering is to our continued economic recoveryEngineers and scientists have always been the worlds problemsolversThey will help us to solve the challenges of clean water lifesavingcures for cancer and disease clean renewable petrofree energyaffordablehealth care and environmental sustainabilityYet if we are to tackle these immense challenges we can no longerwait to begin training our Nations future STEM professionals untilafter they leave the K12 education pipeline That is why I am sopleased that the Race to the Top grant application emphasizes STEMeducation This is just the kind of attention STEM education needsThe Race to the Top fund is designed to reward States that have beensuccessful in raising student achievement and have superior plans toaccelerate education reform State grant applications must of coursefocus on certain core education reform areas However an emphasis onSTEM education is considered a competitive preference priority worth 3percent of a States application score It is the only competitivepreference in the Race to the Top application guidelines Applicantswill earn all or none of the designated points thereby truly rewardingsound initiativesTo meet this priority each State must offer a rigorous course ofstudy in STEM education They are encouraged to collaborate withindustry professionals universities research centers museums andother STEMfocused community partners Additionally each State musthave a plan for preparing and assisting teachers in integrating STEMthroughout the curriculum This includes offering applied learningopportunities and relevant instruction for studentsThere are some successful STEM education programs already inoperation throughout the country A study released by the NationalAcademy of Engineering in September highlighted a handful of K12engineering curriculum projects Other educationbased initiatives arealso spurring interest among our youth For example there is aremarkable afterschool program in Wilmington DE that I recently spokeabout here in the Senate It inspires high school students to pursuecareers in STEM fields by teaching them how to build robots It is agreat program All too often though these types of opportunities havenot been available to all of our Nations students The Race to the Topgrants will bring more opportunities to more studentsPerhaps the most important component for meeting this grant priorityis that States plans must prepare more students to pursue collegemajors and careers in STEM They must also specifically address theneeds of women and underrepresented minorities The United Statescannot maintain its position as a technological leader nor can we solvethe problems we face without a diversity of perspectives andparticipationWomen constitute about half of the students in our higher educationsystem about half of the overall workforce but they comprise onlyslightly more than 12 percent of the science and engineering workforceAfrican Americans hold only 44 percent of science and engineeringjobs Hispanics just 34 percent We can and must do better and theRace to the Top application guidelines are a step in the rightdirectionOver 4 billion is available for competitive grants in the Race tothe Top program This is an unprecedented level of discretionaryfunding for the Department of Education and States nationwide will bepulling out all the stops to earn their share of the pie Many Statesworking months ago to put the correct conditions in place to apply forfundsMoreover the Educate to Innovate campaign was recently launchedby President Obama This campaign is a nationwide effort of privatecompanies universities foundations nonprofits and science andengineering societiesworking with the Federal Governmentto improvestudent performance in STEM subjects As part of this effort businessleaders and nonprofits will be joining forces to identify and replicatesuccessful STEM programs across the country For example Time WarnerCable and the Coalition of Science After School are creating an onlinedirectory of STEM afterschool programs Other STEM organizations willbe teaming up with local volunteers to host National Lab Days andPresident Obama announced an annual science fair at the White HouseThis type of publicprivate collaboration is just the kind of action weneed to bolster STEM educationI sincerely hope the competitive preference for STEM education in theRace to the Top application coupled with the Educate to Innovatecampaign will spur the kind of investment and attention in STEMeducation that I believe all of our students deserve Our country iscounting on these future scientists and engineers  President I am pleased to join the Chairman of theForeign Relations Committee and my colleagues to introduce an importantpiece of legislation the International Climate Change Investment Actof 2009 Climate change is a global issue and only a concertedinternational response can succeed This legislation provides keyelements of an international deal that will both protect our planet andmeet our Nations international responsibilities Even more importantlyin these times it will open the door to a green economy that cancreate jobs here for the markets abroad for clean energy goods andservicesSuccessful global climate negotiations will create the opportunityfor us to transform our own economy to free ourselves from dependenceon fossil fuels from foreign sources and to create the jobs andmarkets for a new sustainable economyThis legislation establishes a new framework for a global market inclean energy technologies A complete agenda to confront climate changewill include support for our educational base and for the researchdevelopment and deployment of clean technologies A climate deal thatmoves us away from fossil fuels will create global demand for thosetechnologies Building capacity and encouraging dramatic change inother countries will create a pool of customers for AmericasinnovatorsThat global market offers us the best chance to create a new economybased on a growing demand for clean energy goods and servicesand thatwill support job creation and profits here at home Companies in myhome state of Delaware and across America are ready and eager to seizethis opportunity for a worlds worth of new markets Our smartestinvestors agreeThis legislation shows the rest of the world that we are ready to doour part to make a smart effective and fair international climatechange agreement work It sets us on a firm forward footing to lead theway in tomorrows green economy
S_MT_BAUCUS,2009-12-20, The requests on this side for a vote at a reasonablehournow it is 10 after 5 say maybe 5 6 7 8 eight clockareasonable time instead of 1 am have been rejected by the otherside  President I will be a bit presumptuous here that Ican speak for most Senators and probably most of the American peopleOne thing in life that is so difficult to deal with is when you areworking with somebody irrespective of a situation and trying toresolve an issue a problem and the person you are talking to orworking with is not dealing in good faith When each side is dealing ingood faith then each side will begin to recognize the merits of theother persons point of view and each person tends to recognize thedeficiencies and faults of his own point of view It is a goodfaithexchangeNot very many things in life are black and white and not many issuesare black and white Most of them are some shade of gray I may thinkthat even though my issuesI am not white and the other guy is blackI like to think my shade of gray is more light than his shade of grayThat is not relevant What works is when both sides talk to each otherand try to make an accommodationI think I can safely say most Americans think our health care systemneeds some repair It is too costly There are too many cases when theinsurance industry cherrypicks and takes advantage of people It isnot the right thing to doAlso we have to find a different way to pay for doctors andhospitals reimbursing on basic quality not quantity Almost alldoctors agree we should move in that directionA few minutes earlier one Senator got up and said CBO has made thishuge error a 12 trillion error He goes on and on about this 12 trillion error To be honest if we are going to deal in good faithwe should mention the pluses and the minuses and let the Senators andthe public figure out where all this nets outCBO has made many statements most of which I think the Democraticside has relied on and CBO has made statements that the Republicanside has relied on It is not black and white It is a shade of grayIn this case it is true that CBO sent a letter I think it wastodayin fact I have it here with methat said they made a 12trillion error in the second 10 years What was the error I dontremember the exact figure but essentially I think CBO said thislegislation will reduce the debt in the last 10 years by I think it was12 percent of GDP which comes out to about 13 trillion to thegood It reduces the debt by 13 trillionCBO in a letter to us came back and said they made a mistake Thislegislation does reduce the Federal budget deficits over the subsequent10 years but not by as much A 12 percent GDP should have beenbetween a 14 percent GDP and 12 percent GDPHalf the story is CBO said they made an error of 12 percent GDPBut the full story is still nevertheless the Congressional BudgetOffice saysAll told CBO expects that the legislation if enactedwould reduce federal budget deficits over the decade over2019 relative to those projected under current lawwith thetotal effect during that decade that is in a broad rangebetween onequarter and onehalf percent of GDPEssentially they are saying We made a mistake at CBO but stillthis is going to reduce deficits between 615 billion and say 13trillion That is the full storyI hope when we debate here that we give both sides of the story Thatway we can work more toward common ground what is right Nobody istotally right Each of us is here serving in good faith We want to dowhat is best for our people in our home States and we are tryingDifferent States have different points of view We are going to getbetter solutions in health care reform if we talk to each other in goodfaith and give the whole story not just part of it  President I yield 10 minutes to the Senator fromColorado Mr Udall  President I yield 10 minutes to the senior Senatorfrom Michigan   President reserving the right to object thedoughnut hole will be filled I have made that promise Senator Reidhas made that promise The White House made that promise When the billis presented on the Presidents desk the doughnut hole will be filledbut not in the way suggested by my friend from Iowa He is one of mybest friends in the Senate and it is with regret that I must object   Reserving the right to object and I will object we havebeen     President just a couple three points here and Isee the Senator from Ohio wishes to speakSeveral times during this afternoon Senators on the other side ofthe aisle in my judgment put on a little demonstration of trying tooffer amendments They repeatedly asked consent to suspend the normalworking of the cloture rule to offer amendments Earlier I note forthe Record they slowwalked the process when an amendment was inorder They wanted the whole amendment read And now they are trying tooffer amendments again to slow down the process This is clearly atactic to slow the process It is not part of the regular order Thatis clearly what is going on here Those were not despite theprotestations to the contrary serious amendmentsNormally when a Senator offers a unanimous consent request theyallow the other side to speak briefly on the subject at least on thereservation of the right to object That was not allowed here Mycolleagues did not allow me that courtesy earlier today to commentwith a reservation of the right to object So I want to take a momentnow to explain what they are really up to I could not because theywould not give me the courtesy to say any words during the reservationThat is why I made that statementI heard one Senator from the other side of the aisle complain thatthe majority is holding tonights vote at 1 am in the morning on thecloture motion Let me set the record straight The majority would behappy to have this vote earlier We would be happy to have this votemaybe in 10 or 15 minutes from now We would be happy to have this voteat a decent time It does not have to be at 1 am tomorrow It is theother side which is insisting that vote be at 1 am in the morning Soit is they who are insisting on enforcing the letter of the Senaterules It is their right but it is also they who are insisting ondelayI also want to put to bed some of the assertions that they claim thisbill does not do real health care reform Let me mention a few healthcare reform provisions in this billMr President I do not know if you or any of my colleagues have readthis second article in the New Yorker magazine by Atul Gawande Thefirst article talks about two towns in Texas basically The second isbasically looking to see whether this bill does reform health care andwhether it does cut down health care costs It is an article I highlyrecommend to all of my colleagues in a recent issue of the New YorkermagazineBut basically Dr Gawande concludes this bill includes all of theconstructive provisions health care economists stakeholders andpeople who have studied this issue suggest should be part of healthcare reform That is his conclusion anyway I am happy he said thatbecause we worked mightily to make sure we have all the provisions wecan here to help constrain health care costsWhat are they Well onealthough some may disagree with thepolicyis an excise tax on highcost plans socalled Cadillac plansIt is a bit debatable Last night I saw a TV ad where a group wasadvocating passage of this bill But just not my highcost plan Passthe bill but just not my highcost plan I understand the tenor andimport of that TV ad but the main point is we do have to begin tolimit to some degree the excessive cost of some plans and I think weare very fair and modest here in proposing an excise tax on those highcost plans The trick is to set the level at the proper level not toohigh not too low I think this bill does thatIn addition all the delivery system reforms this bill enacts withrespect to Medicare are so important to improving quality and reducingexcess costs We all know through history that when we reform Medicareand make changes in Medicare the private sector follows So theprivate commercial market will follow whatever Congress does withrespect to Medicare and that is make good positive changes WhyBecause Medicare is such a large provider of care it tends to have areal effect on what other providers doWhat are some of those Well basically we start to change the waywe pay doctors and hospitals that is we start to pay on the basis ofvalue rather than volume that is quality rather than quantity Theparadox of that is when people stop to think about it we are going toboth cut down costs and increase value at the same time because we willbe focused on quality When you focus on qualitynot just quantitynot the whole volume of services but rather focus on qualityyouare going to get better quality but your costs are going to go downbecause you are not reimbursing things such as excessive MRIsexcessive CAT scans excessive highcost procedures that do not inmany cases get to the quality of health care but rather are veryexpensive and Medicare pays for them So we are moving more towardreimbursing based on quality and value than quantityWhat else is reform of the health care industry One is bundledpayments and the sharedsavings program which we refer to asaccountable care organizations This allows hospitals and groups to gettogether to cut down costs We have bundling in here which is anotheridea that moves along the same lines I might add too the CMSInnovation Center and the Independent Payment Advisory Board suggestsome of theseThe bill makes it easier for employers to offer workplace wellnessprograms We give employers greater flexibility to offer premiumdiscounts for workers who are committed to leading healthierlifestyles There is a lot of emphasis here on wellness and lifestylesWe give incentives to employers to have wellness programs andpreventive programs which will help obviously the worker but inaddition to that cut down costsThere are other provisions here This bill keeps getting strongerThe socalled freshmen package led by Senator Warner will give theSecretary additional authority to expand delivery system reforms Itexpands the scope of the Medicare board to the private sectorThere are many other provisions in hereThe Nations employers through the leadership of the BRT played animportant role in developing that packageAnd the managers amendment included a provision that will providegreater access to Medicare data to measure performanceIt is no exaggeration to say that this bill will revolutionize healthcareBut dont take my word for it The 23 economists who wrote to thePresident agreeMr President I ask unanimous consent that letter from theseeconomists be printed in the RecordThere being no objection the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record as followsStanford UniversityCenter for Health PolicyStanford CA November 17 2009President Barack ObamaThe White HouseWashington DCDear Mr President On behalf of my colleagues a group ofdistinguished economists I am pleased to transmit thisletter regarding essential components of health reformlegislationSincerely yoursAlan M Garber MD PhDHenry J Kaiser Jr Professor Professor of MedicineProfessor of Economics Health Research and Policy and ofEconomics in the Graduate School of Business courtesyDirector Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research andCenter for Health Policy Stanford UniversityNovember 17 2009President Barack ObamaThe White HouseWashington DCDear Mr President As the full Senate prepares to debatecomprehensive health reform legislation we write aseconomists to stress the potential benefits of health reformfor our nations fiscal health and the importance of thosefeatures of the bill that can help keep health care costsunder control Four elements of the legislation are critical1 deficit neutrality 2 an excise tax on highcostinsurance plans 3 an independent Medicare commission and4 delivery system reformsIncluding these four elements in the reform legislationasthe Senate Finance Committee bill does and as we hope thebill brought to the Senate floor will dowill reduce longterm deficits improve the quality of care and put thenation on a firm fiscal footing It will help transform thehealth care system from delivering too much care to a systemthat consistently delivers higherquality highvalue careThe projected increases in federal budget deficits alongwith concerns about the value of the health care thatAmericans receive make it particularly important to enactfiscally responsible and qualityimproving health reform nowIn developing our analysis and recommendation we receivedinput and suggestions from Administration officialsincluding the Office of Management and Budget and others aswell as from economists who disagree with theAdministrations viewsThe four key measures areDeficit neutrality Fiscally responsible health reformrequires budget neutrality or deficit reduction over thecoming years The Congressional Budget Office CBO mustproject that the bill be at least deficit neutral over the10year budget window and deficit reducing thereafterCovering tens of millions of currently uninsured people willincrease spending but the draft health reform legislationcontains offsetting savings sufficient to cover those costsand the seeds of further reforms that will lower the growthof spending Deficit neutrality over the first decade meansthat even during the startup period the legislation willnot add to our deficits After the first decade thelegislation should reduce deficitsExcise tax on highcost insurance plans The Senate FinanceCommittees bill includes an excise tax on highcost healthinsurance plans Like any tax the excise tax will raisefederal revenues but it has additional advantages for thehealth care system that are essential The excise tax willhelp curtail the growth of private health insurance premiumsby creating incentives to limit the costs of plans to a taxfree amount In addition as employers and health plansredesign their benefits to reduce health care premiums cashwages will increase Analysis of the Senate FinanceCommittees proposal suggests that the excise tax on highcost insurance plans would increase workers takehome pay bymore than 300 billion over the next decade This provisionoffers the most promising approach to reducing privatesectorhealth care costs while also giving a much needed raise tothe tens of millions of Americans who receive insurancethrough their employersMedicare Commission Rising Medicare expenditures pose oneof the most difficult fiscal challenges facing the federalgovernment Medicare is technically complex and the benefitsit underwrites are of critical importance to tens of millionsof seniors and Americans with disabilities We believe that acommission of medical experts should be empowered to suggestchanges in Medicare to improve the quality and value ofservices In particular such a commission should be chargedwith developing and suggesting to Congress plans to extendthe solvency of the Medicare program and improve the qualityof care delivered to Medicare beneficiaries Creating such acommission will make sure that reforming the health caresystem does not end with this legislation but continues infuture decades with new efforts to improve quality andcontain costsDelivery system reforms Successful reform should improvethe care that individual patients receive by rewarding healthcare professionals for providing better care not just morecare Studies have shown that hundreds of billions of dollarsare spent on care that does nothing to improve healthoutcomes This is largely a consequence of the distortedincentives associated with paying for volume rather thanquality Health care reform must take steps to change the wayproviders care for patients to reward care that is bettercoordinated and meets the needs of each patient Inparticular the legislation should include additional fundingfor research into what tests and treatments work and whichones do not It must also provide incentives for physiciansand hospitals to focus on quality such as bundled paymentsand accountable care organizations as well as penalties forunnecessary readmissions and healthfacility acquiredinfections Aggressive pilot projects should be rapidlyintroduced and evaluated with the best strategies adoptedquickly throughout the health care systemAs economists we believe that it is important to enacthealth reform and it is essential that health reform includethese four features that will lower health care costs andhelp reduce deficits over the long term Reform legislationthat embodies these four elements can go a long way towarddelivering better health care and better value

yearMr President I ask unanimous consent that an excerpt from DrGawandes article from the New Yorker be printed in the RecordThere being no objection the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record as followsExcerpt From Gawande Article in New YorkerThere are hundreds of pages of these programs almost allof which appear in the House bill as well But the Senatereform package goes a few USDAlike steps further Itcreates a center to generate innovations in paying for andorganizing care It creates an independent Medicare advisorycommission which would sort through all the pilot resultsand make recommendations that would automatically take effectunless Congress blocks them It also takes a decisive step inchanging how insurance companies deal with the costs ofhealth care In the nineteeneighties HMOs tried tocontrol costs by directly overruling doctors recommendationsthrough requiring preauthorization and denying paymentthe backlash taught them that it was far easier to avoidsicker patients and pass along cost increases to employersBoth the House and the Senate bills prevent insurancecompanies from excluding patients But the Senate plan alsoimposes an excise tax on the most expensive Cadillacinsurance plans This pushes private insurers to make thesame efforts that public insurers will make to testincentives and programs that encourage clinicians to keepcosts down President the Senator from Oklahoma at one pointquestioned the constitutionality of the mandate to buy healthinsurance I might say we thoroughly studied this issue I believethere is ample authority for Congress to enact such a provision underthe Commerce Clause and also under the congressional authority to taxand spend for the general welfare provided for in the ConstitutionI might also add Prof Mark Hall of Wake Forest University has donean excellent survey article on this subject Mr President I askunanimous consent that the conclusion of Professor Halls articlefound at a

Constitutionality of Mandates ToPurchase Health InsuranceBy Mark A Hall JDExecutive SummaryPrepared by the ONeill InstituteintroductionHealth insurance mandates have been a component of manyrecent health care reform proposals Because a federalrequirement that individuals transfer money to a privateparty is unprecedented a number of legal issues must beexamined This paper analyzes whether Congress can legislatea health insurance mandate and the potential legal challengesthat might arise given such a mandate The analysis of legalchallenges to health insurance mandates applies to federalindividual mandates but can also apply to a federal mandaterequiring employers to purchase health insurance for theiremployees There are no Constitutional barriers for Congressto legislate a health insurance mandate as long as themandate is properly designed and executed as discussedbelow This paper also considers the likelihood of any changein the current judicial approach to these legal questionsPOTENTIAL SOLUTIONSCongresss Authority to Regulate Commerce The federalgovernment has the authority to legislate a health insurancemandate under the Commerce Clause of the United StatesConstitution A federal mandate to purchase health insuranceis well within the breadth of Congress power to regulateinterstate commerce Congress can avoid legal challengesrelated to the 10th Amendment and states rights by preempting state insurance laws and implementing the mandate ona federal level If Congress wants states to implement afederal mandate it has the following two optionsConditional Spending Congress may condition federalfunding such as that for Medicaid or public health on statecompliance with federal initiativesConditional Preemption Congress may allow states to optout of complying with direct federal regulation as long asstates implement a similar regulation that meets federalrequirementsCongresss Authority to Tax and Spend for the GeneralWelfare Congress also has the authority to legislate ahealth insurance mandate under its Constitutional authorityto tax and spend There are no plausible Tenth Amendment andstates rights issues arising from Congresss taxing andspending power However Congress taxation power cannot beused in a way that burdens a fundamental right recognized inthe Constitutions Bill of Rights and judicialinterpretations by the US Supreme Court Since there is nofundamental right to be uninsured no fundamental rightschallenge existsOther Relevant Constitutional Rights Challenges under theFirst and Fifth Amendments relating to individual rights mayarise but are unlikely to succeed The federal governmentshould include an exemption on religious grounds to a healthinsurance mandate as an added measure of protection fromlegal challenges based on religious freedom In thealternative the federal government can simply exempt afederal insurance mandate from existing federal legislationprotecting religious freedomConsiderations To avoid a heightened level of scrutiny inany judicial review the federal government should articulateits substantive rationale for mandating health insuranceduring the legislative processlegal issues  applicable lawCommerce Clause Congress has the power to regulateinterstate commerce including local matters thatsubstantially affect interstate commerce Health care andhealth insurance both affects and is distributed throughinterstate commerce giving Congress the power to legislatean insurance mandate using its Commerce Clause powersTaxing and Spending Power Congress has the power to taxand spend for the general welfare It can use its taxingpower to implement a pay or play model to tax individualsthat did not purchase insurance or provide tax benefits tothose that do purchase insurance Congress can also use itsspending powers to influence state action The taxing powerof the federal government can be limited if a taxintentionally and directly burdens the exercise of afundamental rightFederalism The 10th Amendment and principle of statesovereignty in the Constitution prohibit the federalgovernment from commanding the states to implement federallaw or policies that would interfere with state sovereigntyThis is referred to as the anticommandeering principleA federal employer mandate covering state and localgovernment workers appears consistent with existingConstitutional decisions but still might be susceptible tochallenge under the Tenth AmendmentIndividual Rights The First and Fifth Amendment containprovisions that may have some bearing on a health insurancemandateFree Exercise of Religion The First Amendments FreeExercise Clause protects the free exercise of religion Inaddition the Religious Freedom Restoration Act RFRAprevents the federal government from enacting a law thatsubstantially burdens an individuals exercise of religionunless the government has a compelling interestDue Process and Takings Clauses The Fifth Amendmentincludes two relevant provisions The Due Process Clauseguarantees that no person shall be deprived of life libertyor property without due process of law The Takings Clausestates that the government may not take an individualsproperty without just compensationCONCLUSIONThe Constitution permits Congress to legislate a healthinsurance mandate Congress can use its Commerce Clausepowers or its taxing and spending powers to create such amandate Congress can impose a tax on those that do notpurchase insurance or provide tax benefits to those that dopurchase insurance If Congress would like the states toimplement an insurance mandate it can avoid conflicts withthe anticommandeering principle by either preempting stateinsurance laws or by conditioning federal funds on statecompliance A federal employer mandate for state and localgovernment workers may be subject to a challenge howeversuch a challenge is unlikely to be successful Individualrights challenges under the First Amendments Free ExerciseClause or RFRA are unlikely to succeed although a federalinsurance mandate should include a statement that RFRA doesnot apply or provide for a religious exemption FifthAmendment Due Process and Takings Clause challenges are alsounlikely to be successful The legal analysis presented islikely to endure as the Supreme Courts current position andapproach to interpreting relevant constitutional issuesappear to be stable President the Senator fromOklahoma said the independent Medicare advisory board would rationcare In fact he even accused us in the Congressmyself includedofvoting against a prohibition on rationing But I might say I am notfor rationing care in the sense that the Senator from Oklahoma talkedabout I do not think anybody in this Congress is We have to find asystem that starts to control costs in a fair way that increasesquality but also cuts costs That is the underlying premise of thedelivery system reforms in this bill But do not just take my word forit Right here in the bill on page 1004 the bill says with regard tothe advisory boardThe proposal shall not include any recommendation to rationhealth careI chuckle a little bit when I say that because the Senator fromOklahoma is very concerned about using the word shall If he doesnot like shall then I suppose he means the board would havediscretion But we say shall not include any recommendation to rationhealth care That is on page 1004 of the bill It is right there inblack and white letters Read the bill The prohibition againstrationing of health care is right thereMr President I see the Senator from Ohio who wishes to speak  Reserving the right to object this is the fourth timetoday Senators on the other side    Madam President it has been more than a month since themajority leader moved to proceed to the health care bill before ustoday This bill will provide real reform for our Nations flawedhealth care system This bill is the product of years of hard workstudy and deliberation in both the Finance Committee and the HELPCommitteeand I mean yearsall transparent all aboveboard all outin the open In fact in the Finance Committee we initiated a newrequirement that all amendments to the bill would have to be posted inadvance on the Internet so everybody could know what they were thesame with the bill itself The mark was on the Internet for a couple 3days before we even went to markup It is unprecedented how open andtransparent the process has been The same is true in the HELPCommitteeThe culmination of these efforts has been the weeks of debate on thisbill in the Senate These provisions have been in the public domain fora long time It is true there could be minor changes here and therebut most of this has been in the public domain for a long time We haveconsidered numerous amendments We have engaged in a full and healthydiscussion The bill before us is fully paid for It is important tokeep reminding colleagues over and over again This is fully paid forDont take my word for it That is what the CBO said The Americanpeople trust and realize according to the Congressional Budget Officea nonpartisan organization that this bill is fully paid for It doesnot add one thin dime to the deficit You are going to hear others whodont have their own proposals just want to be negative want to try toshoot holes in this try to say it adds to the deficit That is theiropinion That is not the opinion of the CBO CBO says it does not addone thin dimeThis bill will also reduce the Federal deficit in the short term andover the long term It reduces the Federal deficit We are so veryconcerned about deficits We in the Congress are and the country is Wehave to begin as soon as we can to start getting those deficits downand the national debt lowered This health care reform bill not onlyprovides health insurance coverage and reforms the insurance industrydramatically it also takes the steps of lowering the deficit andlowering the longterm debtLet me quote from the Congressional Budget Office letter ofyesterdayCBO and Joint Committee on Taxation estimate that onbalance the direct spending and revenue effects of enactingthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act incorporatingthe managers amendment would yield a net reduction infederal deficits of 132 billion over the 10year periodA net reduction of 132 billion That is even better than the mergedbill was just before we included the managers amendment That was a130 reduction in the national deficit With the managers amendmentaccording to the CBO there is a net reduction in the Federal deficitof 132 billion over the 10year period What about later Often peoplesay Gee I hear you Senator you are taking care of things in theshort term but you are enacting legislation that will have an adverselongterm effect That is what you guys do back thereYou hear that often Let me disclose what the Congressional BudgetOffice says about that This legislation will reduce the deficitmarkedly in the outyears Here is what the CBO says in a letterreleased todayAll told the Congressional Budget Office expects thatthe legislation if enacted would reduce federal budgetdeficits over the decade after 2019 relative to thoseprojected under current lawwith a total effect during thatdecade that is in the broad range of between onequarterand onehalf percent of GDPWhat are they saying They are saying that in the second 10 yearsthe deficit will be reduced between onequarter and onehalf percent ofGDP That is between 630 billion and 13 trillion That is realmoney We are going to reduce the Federal deficit by this legislationalone Lets take the between 630 billion and 13 trillionroughly1 trillion in the next decade That is important That is significantThat is a good startThe legislation before us will extend insurance coverage to more than30 million Americans Think of that 30 million Americans who today donot have insurance will get health insurance That is so important Ihave forgotten the exact figure but I remember there was a Harvardstudy that concluded that 45000 Americans die every year because theyhave no health insurance Obviously people without health insurancedie earlier at an earlier age Just for the sake of their own healthit is good those people get health insurance let alone the benefit tohospitals by reducing uncompensated careThis legislation will increase insurance coverage to more than 30million Americans I have just been passed a note that people have a40percent higher chance of dying without health insurance We aresaying to those folks those 31 million Americans we are going tofigure out a way so you have health insurance so you do not have that40percent higher risk of deathHere is what CBO says about coverageBy 2019 the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation estimatethat the number of nonelderly people who are uninsured willbe reduced by about 31 millionCBO goes on to sayUnder the legislation the share of legal nonelderlyresidents with insurance coverage would rise from 83 percentcurrently to about 94 percentThat is 94 percent of the folks in our country excluding seniorsbecause they have insurance under Medicare excluding them andexcluding the unauthorized the total number of Americans who havehealth insurance will rise from the current number of 83 percent toabout 94 percentThis legislation will drive down premium costs for virtually all ofus It will drive down premium costs for virtually all In an earlierletter the CBO indicated premiums would go down for roughly 93 percentof Americans under the underlying bill Premiums would go down about 93percent for Americans I was going to put a table in the record butour rules dont allow us to put tables in so I summarized Theconclusion of that summary is 93 percent of Americans will experiencelower premiumsnot dramatic for some folks but nevertheless down anddown is better than not downInsurance costs would go down significantly for those receiving taxcredits in the new insurance exchanges It will protect consumers fromharmful insurance company practices This is so important As you knowno longer will insurance companies be able to deny coverage for thosewith preexisting conditions It is an outrage how much insurancecompanies deny coverage based on preexisting conditions We all hearstories many times if not from direct family members from friends offamily who run into this It is so common especially in the individualmarket as people buy insurance for themselves Insurance companies denycoverage deny giving health insurance to somebody because of apreexisting condition It is wrongNo longer will insurance companies be able to drop coverage for thosewho are sick That is very important too Companies often rescindwillynillyThey found something in the background of the person you didnt tellus about that so we are rescinding your policy That is not right Thatis just not right We prevent that from happening in this legislationIt will also improve choice and competition in the insurance marketWe talk a lot about choice and competition This legislation providesmore choice in choosing policies and more competition in the insurancemarket It will also create a true marketplace where plans compete oncost and quality rather than on their ability to cherrypick thehealthiest among usIt will represent the largest tax cut for American families thatCongress has passed since 2001 This legislation includes the largesttax cut for American families that Congress has passed since that taxcut bill in 2001 the largest It is the tax credits people willreceive to help them buy insurance That totals up I think to 440billion I have forgotten the exact figures But this is the largesttax cut for American families since 2001 It will provide billions ofdollars in tax credits to help families workers and small businessesto buy quality affordable health care insurance The managersamendment makes this good bill even better It will provide even moreconsumer protections against harmful insurance industry practicesFor example it will hold companies accountable for excessive premiumrate increases It will require them to spend more on consumer benefitsand less on administrative costs and profits That is new That is evenbetter consumer protection compared with the underlying bill It willrestrict the ability of health plans to impose annual limits onbenefits That is new restricting the ability of health plans toimpose annual limits on benefits It is wrong if you have an insurancepolicy that lo and behold the company says We didnt know you weregoing to be that sick so we stopped the benefits you can get annuallyand also lifetime We do both We restrict the ability of health plansto impose not only annual limits but also lifetime limits on benefitsThis managers package will ensure that companies cannot discriminateagainst children with preexisting conditions and do so right awaybeginning with plans that become effective midyear next year Thepreexisting condition restriction would ordinarily not take effect fora couple years but for children the preexisting condition prohibitionwill take effect right away There are other provisions to help peoplebetween now and 2014 There is highrisk pooling for example lots ofdifferent provisions in this bill which will help people get goodbenefits and protection very quicklyThis legislation will provide tax credits to even more smallbusinesses The managers amendment will provide even more tax creditsthan the underlying bill These benefits will now be available rightaway in 2010 It is also a concern when will the tax credits for smallbusiness go into effectshouldnt they go into effect earlier Underthis managers amendment these benefits will be available in 2010This will also provide more health insurance choices through a newmultistate option That option offers consumers the same healthinsurance Congress has todayno small matter It will extend extrafunding for the Childrens Health Insurance Program for 2 additionalyears We are all very concerned about kids health care Thechildrens health care program has done a pretty good job This hasbeen extended under the managers amendment for an additional 2years It will do even more to control rising health care costs andreward even more providers for providing quality care to seniorsthrough the Medicare Program It will invest 10 billion in communityhealth centers They are so important community health centers forfolks who need help right away and dont have insurance just need thecare right away Especially in rural communities it will provideaccess to critical care where often that care is most neededThese are the reforms which Americans have been waiting for fordecades Americans are waiting for these changes They are waiting forthese reforms and have been for a long time Decades may be anunderstatement Our health insurance system just doesnt do what itshould for Americans the people we represent Finally we are taking avery significant first step to providing those reforms These arereforms American families workers and businesses desperately needThey are reforms on which our economic stability depends That is nosmall matter either If we get our insurance costs under control thatis more economic stability for everyone It is not just for familieswho dont know what the insurance company is or is not going to do itis for small businesses that dont know whether premiums will be up orby how much next year Why It is more economic stability for familiesand small businesses and soon more economic stability for budgetsState budgets our Federal budgetWe need to get a little more control over all the excessive coststhat are going up and also the volatility the yoyo effect thatpremiums have and outofpocket cost impositions have on people Thiswill help them very significantlySo by and large to be honestI know this sounds a little naiveperhapsI do not know why this bill does not get an overwhelmingendorsement This is a big vote on both sides of the aisle Then wecan next year keep going from there add new provisions that need tobe added correct mistakes that probably this legislation is going tohave but work together because most Americans want us to work togetherback here They do not like us being partisan or politicalI must say this place is getting a little more partisan over thelast couple years than it was earlier It is not what the Americanpeople want They want us to do our job do what is right This billclearly is in the bounds of reasonableness of what is right and what isthe right thing to do to get control of our health care systemAgain I hope we can get this passed by a large margin It will passBut I would like it passed by a large marginMadam President I now yield 20 minutes to the Senator from RhodeIsland Mr WhitehouseThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Rhode Island  President I yield 15 minutes to the Senator fromOregon  President I wish to thank the Senator from Oregonfor many reasons one of which is his kind words which are reallyappreciated but much more important than that his long dedication tohealth care reform He even worked for the Gray Panthers way backbefore he came here I remember the name Ron Wyden Gray Panthers agood number of years ago Then lo and behold both Houses of Congresstogetherwe worked together on reforming Medigap coverage It was anoutrage Today we talk about medical loss ratios of maybe 80 percent85 percent up to 90 percent and so forth I can remember back when itwas an outrage the degree to which Medigap insurance coverage hadmedical loss ratios of not 80 percent not 70 percent not 60 percentit would be below 50 percent Insurance companies were sellinginsurance to seniors trying to cover that gap between what Medicarewould and would not cover and just tragically low embarrassingly lowoutrageously low medical loss ratiosSenator Wyden and I got together and got legislation passed to reformthe Medigap marketto make Medigap insurance plans more fair Theywere ripping seniors off there was no doubt about it and we got thatchangedNow on health care reform an ardent advocate of more competitionmore choice in our health care systemit is clear we need morecompetition It is clear we need more choice On the competition sidein many of our States we find there is only one or two insurancecompanies that dominate the entire State That is very true around ourcountry There is just not the competition there should beIn addition there is not the choice A lot of employees would liketo have more choice among insurance companies in their kinds ofpolicies and so on and so forth We have a system where most employeesare tied to their employer it is pretty much insurance coverage theemployer offersIf we were starting from scratch maybe 20 30 40 60 maybe 80 yearsago we may not have had such an employerbased system as we havetoday Our current Tax Code also tends to encourage excessive insurancecoverage because of our employerbased systemAnyway I am digressing Senator Wyden got us thinking a lot earlierabout the problems that caused and frankly I think he is right Ithink a lot of Americans think he is right You can only take things astep at a time here and we are probably not going nearly as far as theSenator from Oregon wishes to go But I thank him He is there he isdogged and he works hard on behalf of seniors He is an advocate ofAmerican consumers respected by health insurance companies notletting the companies take advantage of citizens I thank the Senatorfor thatI do not see any Senators on the floor on our side If there were itwould be a good time for them to speak Pending the arrival of theDemocratic Senators let me say a few things about small businessClearly one of the goals of health care reform is to ensure thatemployees of small businesses have good quality affordable healthcare options We all know that is clear I have talked to smallbusinesspeopleI will never forget a conversation I had with a logger who has fouror five or six people working for him It was about 2 or 3 years ago Iasked him if he had health insurance He said yes for his familyhiswife and himselfI asked How about your employees He said no he didnt You couldtell he wanted to and he wasnt just blowing smoke He clearly wantedto provide insurance for his employees but it just pained him becauseit was too expensiveWe all hear stories like that they are legion I can remembertalking to another small businessman in my State of Montana acontractor who has 5 6 8 10 people working for him He is justbeside himself because the insurance company told him his premiums aregoing to go up 40 percent next yearHe said Max I cant deal with thatI asked Why are they going up 40 percentHe said Well they found a preexisting condition with respect to oneof my employees He said Max I was beside myself I cant afford a40percent increase They said it would only be a 20percent increaseif I let him go But he has been with me 15 20 years and is one of mybest employees I cant let him goHe found another carrier and kept his employee So he did findanother insurance carrier but he had to pay about a 20percentincrease in premiums He was able to keep his employee but that isjust wrong It is so hard for small businesses to provide healthinsurance to their employees I know it is a trite thing to say butmost jobs in our country are created by small businessmen That iswhere most of the jobs are and it is where most of the creativity isThat is in many cases where the greatest need is to help encourageentrepreneurism American ingenuity and where a small businesspersoncan do a good job with the service he is providingLast year 62 percent of small businesses did offer health insuranceto their employees Compare that with other companies that have say200 employees Among all companies in America that have 200 or moreemployees 99 percent of them have offered their employees healthinsurance Contrast 62 percent of small businesses offer healthinsurance and 99 percent of businesses with more than 200 employeesoffer health insuranceAmong the very small businesses in our country it is lower lowerthan 69 percent Now it is only 49 percenta very small number ofemployeesthat have health insurance through their small businessemployer There are clearly very significant reasons for that Thereare barriers that prevent small businesses from finding affordablehealth insurance options What are theySmall businesspeople tell us the main reasonat least one of themis that the premiums are just too high I mentioned an example of thecontractor I talked with in my State who said they are going to chargea 40percent increase in premiums as further evidence that premiums aretoo high It is understandable that is one of the main reasons smallbusinesses cant get health insuranceIn the past 10 years premiums have risen 82 percent for singleworkers and 93 percent for families employed by small businessvirtually doubled premiums in the last 10 years if you are a singleperson and work for a very small business That is not true for bigbusinessAs health care costs rise small businesses are forced to makeworkers pay a greater portion of these expensive premiums In 2008 forexample employees at small businesses that did provide healthinsurance paid more than twice what they paid just 8 years earliertwice as muchThe low rate of offering and higher costsharing responsibilities foremployees in small businesses often limit the ability of smallbusinesses to attract and retain employeesThat is why the health care bill before us includes many provisionsto make quality coverage for small business more affordable not onlyfor the businesspeople but for their employees Before the managersamendment the bill did include 24 billion in tax credits to helpsmall businesses and charitable organizations purchase health insurancefor their employeesThe managers amendment dedicates additional billions to providingtax credits to small businesses to make health insurance moreaffordable The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee onTaxation which I know is near and dear to the heart of the PresidingOfficerafter all they are an independent arbiter They can tell uswith objectivity what this legislation is or is notthey estimate thatthe tax credit for small businesses will provide 40 billion in taxrelief to small businesses over their first 10 yearsIn addition we start the tax credits a year early that is we startthem in 2010 In the earlier bill it was 2011 In the managersamendment we start in 2010 right away This means that in just over aweek after the legislation is passed and signed into law eligiblesmall businesses will be able to receive tax credits to help them buyhealth insurance for their employees This expansion of the tax creditsmeans eligible small businesses will now be able to receive up to 6years of tax credits So now starting in 2010 eligible smallbusinesses will receive tax credits worth up to 35 percent of theemployers contribution to employee health insurance plans35 percentThen in 2014 it is even better Eligible small businesses willreceive tax credits worth up to 50 percent of the employerscontribution to employee health insurance plans purchased in healthinsurance exchanges The employer would get 50 percent of the cost ofthe health insurance that would be available for credit that is theemployer can credit 50 percent subtract from his income taxes 50percent of the cost of insuranceWhat do you have to do to qualify Businesses must cover at least 50percent of employee premium costs If you cover half the employeecosts you get to subtract your half from your income taxes The valuetax credit is based on the size of the business and the average wagepaid to its employeesThe managers amendment strengthens the assistance to smallbusinesses by expanding the small business tax credit In the managersamendment the tax credit will be available to small businesses withfewer than 25 employees and less than 50000 average annual wages Andthe full value of the tax credit is now available to small businesseswith 10 or fewer employees and 25000 or less in average annual wagesIt moved up from 20000 to 25000 so more small businesses canqualify and take advantage of that tax credit By expanding the wagethresholds which I just described more small businesses will be ableto claim the tax credits And tax credits will phase out more slowly aswages increase This was a high priority for small businesses Werecognized that and responded to itThe small business tax credit will help make insurance affordable formany small businesses In 2011 42 million Americans will be coveredby quality affordable health coverage 42 million Americans will beable to take advantage of this On average small businesses across thecountry would receive a new tax credit of about 4900 to help thempurchase insurance That is per employee 4900 to help them purchaseinsurance for their employeesThe CBO estimates that the small business tax credit will help lowerinsurance costs by 8 to 11 percent for the employees of smallbusinesses receiving the credit Let me say that again CBO estimatesthat the small business credit will help lower insurance costs by 8 to11 percent for the employees of small businesses who receive theircredit Without the small business tax credit many people would haveto buy insurance through the exchange on their own without the benefitof a contribution from their employerOne of the reasons many small businesses are currently unable toafford health insurance is because small businesses lack the buyingpower larger companies have to negotiate affordable group rates TheSenate bill creates small business insurance exchanges known as SHOPexchanges where small businesses can band together and pool theirrisks which will enhance their choice and buying power These Statebased exchanges will be a critical tool to help small businesses withfewer than 100 employees shop for health insurance plans and determinetheir eligibility for tax credits to buy health insurance Smallbusinesses that prosper and grow beyond 100 employees would be allowedto continue shopping through the exchangespooling The insuranceplans sold in SHOP exchanges would be subject to the same transparencyrequirements and consumer protections so small businesses can feelconfident they are purchasing highquality plans that will providequality affordable coverage for their workersThe legislation also institutes reforms in the insurance market thatwill protect individuals and small businesses purchasing plans bothinside and outside these SHOP exchanges These reforms will stopinsurance companies from denying coverage based on a personspreexisting health condition or increasing a persons health insurancepremiums based on health status or on gender and occupationa practicethat just has to be stoppedThese new regulations are essential to helping small businesses keephealth care costs predictable from year to year That is one of the bigproblems Small businesses face this sea of chaos of volatilityuncertainty unpredictability in knowing what their insurance costswill or will not be That is why insurance companies cherrypick andtake advantage for themselves to maximize their profits but it has theopposite effect on small businesses This will help frankly to buy alot more certainty that we desperately needThe changes in the managers amendment will go the extra step andensure this bill provides small businesses with the help they sodesperately need Passing health care reform is critical to smallbusinesses Without reformthis is no small matter I am not blowingsmoke herewithout reform many small businesses will be forced todrop their health insurance coverage they may already have because theycan no longer afford it They cannot afford the increase in premiumsThis will leave many employees to fend for themselves in the individualmarket We know without this bill passing how unfair the individualmarket is to peopleMany of the provisions in this bill were designed with smallbusinesses in mind The bill gives small businesses access to areformed marketplace where they will have improved buying power tonegotiate rates And the Senate bill provides tax credits to help smallbusinesses buy health insurance for their employeesData from CBO tells us that these reforms will make coverage moreaffordable for millions of small business employees The small businesstax credit will help reduce health care costs for small businesses andtheir employees As a result of the larger health reform proposals inthe bill there will be an increase in the percentage of small firmsthat offer health insurance coverageWe must act to help small businesses access to quality affordablehealth care options for their employees Too many small businessesaround the country are waiting  Will the Senator yield for one brief minute  Will the Senator yield so I can show him  He doesnt  For the sixth time we are engaged in this stunt so Iobject  Will my colleague yield on that point  I wish to ask my colleague who knows the Senateprocedures so very well why are we having a 1 am vote Isnt itpossible it could be a different time   President reserving the right to object as enticingas that might sound I object  
S_IL_DURBIN,2009-12-20, Whatthe Senator from Oklahoma says isWhat the American people ought to pray is that somebodycant make the vote tonight Thats what they ought to prayI do not think it is appropriate to be invoking prayer to wishmisfortune on a colleague I want him to clarify that I have invitedhim I tried to reach out to him He is my friend and I have workedwith him But this statement goes too farThe simple reality is this We are becoming more coarse and moredivided It is understandable we would disagree on political issuesThat happens all the time But unfortunately we have allowed thatpolitical disagreement to spill over into our personal relationshipsand friendships and that does hurt this institutionWe rely on one another on both sides of the aisle so much I wouldsay from the start that Senator Reid has offered the Republican side ofthe aisle accommodations and asked we try to do things that might helpthe families and individuals in the Senate and we have not had anyluck to dateHope springs eternal I hope Senator Coburn can make it to the floorto explain his statement Earlier this week there was a prayercastinvolving several SenatorsI did not hear it I only heard referencesto itwhere they were actually in a group praying for the defeat ofthis legislation on health care reform It is their right to do thatI can recall as a high school football player saying a prayer my teamwould win a football game I dont know if God had any time to worryabout my little football game But when it reaches a point where we arepraying asking people to pray that Senators wont be able to answer arollcall I think it has crossed the line I hope my friend andcolleague from Oklahoma will come and explain exactly what he meantI wish the bill before us were different I wish it had a strongpublic option I wish it offered Medicare to people 55 years and olderI wish it eliminated the MCCarranFerguson antitrust exemption forhealth insurance companies Unfortunately it does not do those thingsMy disappointment over those elements should not lead me to concludethis bill is wanting or bad The opposite is true We have to look tothe positive side of what this legislation will doThis health care reform will extend the reach of health insurancecoverage to 30 million more Americans I see on the floor this eveningmy colleague from Arizona He and I were on a television show earlythis morning I am sure we got great ratings because thepublic cant wait to hear us but during the course of that televisionshow the Senator from Arizona expressed concern that 20 millionAmericans would not be covered by our billInteresting isnt it Today 50 million Americans are not insured 50million Americans are uninsured This bill will provide insurance for30 million more meaning 94 percent of Americans will have coveragethe highest percentage in the history of our country The Senator fromArizona says it does not go far enough to include more peopleWe have waited patiently now for 21 days during the course of thisdebate on health care reform for the Republican plan for reforminghealth care It has never been produced Promised but never produced Ithink the reason is obvious It does not exist Several times they havesaid on the floor We have a plan and they will wave a bill at usWhen the Republicans had a chance over a 3week period of time to offertheir substitute they never did In fact in over 20 days of activedebate on the floor there were exactly four Republican amendments onhealth care reform Four in 20 days 1 every 5 days At that rate howlong would the Republicans have us stay on the floor waiting for thenext amendmentThat is the reality They offered six motions to stop the debateremove the bill from the floor and send it back to committee Ofcourse when it came to actual substantive amendments changing sectionsof the bill they would not do it So the Republicans have come upempty They are running on empty when it comes to health care reformwhich means this task of writing a bill is either beyond their paygrade or beyond their will and they like the system as it existsI do not Fifty million uninsured Americans is unacceptable in thiscountry I think we have to reach a point where we move forward with 30million now and then find ways to bring in the additional 20 millionRemember when Social Security was enacted into law with theresistance of the Republicansthey resisted it saying it is too muchgovernmentthe safety net extended to widows We extended in yearsthat followed Social Security protection to dependents survivors andthe disabled and we added a costofliving adjustmentIt was not the end of Social Security in the 1930s In the years thatfollowed we built on the original bill and we will build on thisoriginal model of health care reform The same thing is true underMedicare Medicare as originally offered did not cover disabled peopleIt did not provide home health care therapy or prescription drugsOver the years we added those benefitsI believe this is an important starting point I also think it isimportant we provide insurance protection for Americans When it comesright down to it too many people are denied the therapies thesurgeries the medications their doctors recommend because some clerkin an office at a health insurance company is instructed to just sayno and they say no repeatedlyWe also make sure that patients are first even with our additionalamendment guaranteeing the right of people to pick their doctor andkeep their doctor It is a patientfirst approach that we are using onthis billWe hold the health insurance companies accountable and say if theyturn around and gouge the patients before they want to be part of theinsurance exchange they can be disqualified We saw what happened withcredit card reform When the banks had their way after the passage ofcredit card reform and during the period before it went into law theyran up the interest rates on credit cards I got letters in the mailfrom American Express and others saying Incidentally because of thenew Federal law we are going to raise your interest rate on yourcredit card over 20 percent We know some of these merchants givenenough time will capitalize on that time and try to exploit thatsystem Our bill is going to go after themThe medical loss ratio is an important part in the bill I am surethe health insurance companies are not going to be happy with it Itsays Stop taking those premium dollars and turning them intoadministrative expenses advertising bonuses for CEOs highpaidsalaries Take the money and pay for medical services for the peopleyou insure If you do not if you take too much of this money forprofiteering you are going to have to rebate it to your customers Itis changing the balance giving customers a chance when it comes tohealth insurancesomething that is long overdueWe extend the health care safety net in this bill Mr President 18million people in my home State of Illinois will have access toaffordable health insurance I have met them They are hardworkingpeople small businesses parttime employees unemployed peoplenoneof them has health insurance Again 18 million in my State of almost13 million are going to have the chance to be coveredWe will have 10000 more community health centersI cannot tell you what an exciting idea this is If you visit acommunity health center in Arizona or Illinois you know what I amtalking about This is a clinic in a neighborhood usually or smalltown where people can literally walk through the front door and getaccess to primary care physicians who will help them through theirmedical difficulties They do not have to wait until they are so badthey end up in an emergency room where costs are dramatically higherThey have a doctor a nurse a medical professional a dentist rightthere in their community We estimate this bill will add 10000 morecommunity health clinics across the United States That is going to bea dramatic changeIt also will create the opportunity for 20000 more primary carephysicians across America If there is anything more we need it isfamily care internists who can deal with the medical needs of peoplebefore they are referred to a specialist or before their situation hasdeterioratedThis bill is going to provide for all people under 133 percent ofpovertythat is about 29000 for a family of fourthe security ofknowing they are under Medicaid protection without health insurancecosts without health insurance premiums We will say to those workingpoor people You are going to have health insurance We also believethat progress is going to take some timeI recall that Senator Teddy Kennedy who I wish were here for thisgreat battle for which he prepared for four decades said in his bookTrue Compass toward the end that real reform is never over It isnot This is a beginning It is an important beginning It establishesimportant principlesI say to the critics we dont expect every aspect of this bill towork perfectly It is an imperfect product made by mere humans tryingto do their best But some of the things in this bill are going todramatically change health care in America for the better We are goingto find ways to deliver quality care to people in a costeffective wayWe are going to change parts of our system today which unfortunatelyunder this current system are out of control The costs are out ofcontrolMoving coverage to an additional 30 million people 94 percent ofAmericans under coverage something no other bill from either side ofthe aisle has proposed reducing our deficitincidentally we now havea CBO statement which makes it clear that the budget savings in thesecond 10 yearsthe first 10 years is 130 billion the second 10years is up to 13 trillion They qualified it but it still is themost dramatic deficit reduction bill in the history of the UnitedStates There has never been a bill that has come before us thatreduces our deficit so dramaticallyIt reduces it because it works It brings down the cost of healthcare As far as Medicare is concerned this bill will add at least 9years of life to Medicare Medicare which is going to face seriousfinancial problems in about 7 or 8 years has a new lease on life withthis bill of 9 or 10 yearsTo say this saves Medicare and puts it on sound footing is a factthat has been confirmed by the Congressional Budget Office all thespeeches on the floor notwithstandingThis bill is also going to move us forward in the whole area oflooking at ways to deal with medical negligence and medicalmalpractice We provide incentives and grants to States to find wayswithout penalizing the true victims of medical malpractice to reducethe incidence of lawsuits to reduce defensive medicine That is aconscientious and thoughtful way to approach thisI would say if I were to ask anyone to offer a prayerand I dontdo that very oftenI would say a prayer for the 50 million uninsuredAmericans folks who go to bed without peace of mind that they havehealth insurance for themselves and their families I would say aprayer for those turned down by health insurance companies when theirdoctor says they need a certain therapy or a certain medication or acertain surgery Those are the people I think of I pray good fortunefor them I do not pray for misfortune for anyone in the Senatenotfor any of my colleagues not for any of my political opponents I donot think that is appropriate use of prayer to do thatI am sorry as I bring this to an end that the Senator from Oklahomahas not been able to come to the floor I have tried now on severaloccasions through the cloakroom and other ways to invite him to comeand explain his remarks I am troubled when he says the American peopleought to pray that somebody cant make the vote tonight I pray foreverybody I dont pray for misfortune for anyone in the Senate Letshave the vote Lets have all 100 Senators here voting theirconscience voting their heartMr President I yield the floor The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Illinois Therehave been four substantive amendments offered by the Republican sideThey have had ample opportunity to call for this The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Objection has been heard  Madam President I thank the majority leader fordesignating that I should control half the time between now and 130I would like to first thank all the people who are here the staffand the pages This has been a tough session for many but tougher formany of them than some Members of the Senate because many times theyhave had to wait until the very last Senator of either political partyhas finished for the day before they go home I was reflecting on thatyesterday afternoon in the midst of one of the toughest historicsnowstorms in Washington DC that hundreds of staff people werewaiting at their post doing their jobs on a Saturday in the middle ofa snowstorm when virtually every business around Washington wasclosing down I wish to thank them and the pages on both sides of theaisle for their patience and commitment to this great country and thisgreat institutionWhy are we here on Sunday Why were we here on Saturday Why are wegoing to take a vote at 1 in the morning on Monday Good questions andI am not sure there are satisfying answers But there are answers Weare here because we are trying to finish health care reform It hasbeen a project that has been underway for almost a year now since thePresident challenged us to do something and a lot of effort has beenexpended on both sides of the aisle But I will say I can speak for ourside of the aisleSenator Max Baucus came to me more than a year ago and sat down in myoffice to talk about health care reform He was preparing for thisbattle as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and knew he wouldplay a central role gathering the opinions of members of his committeeand Members of the SenateEfforts were underway with Senator Kennedy from his remote locationin Massachusetts recuperating from surgery and from cancer therapytrying to keep his committee on track toward health care reform Heturned over that mantle to Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut whodid an admirable job with the Senate Health Education Labor andPensions CommitteeThey prepared for and had hearings They entertained hundreds ofamendments In fact I believe there were over 160 amendments that wereproposed by the Republicans and many of them were adopted in the HELPCommitteeSenator Coburn of Oklahoma filed 212 amendments during the HELPCommittee markup He offered 38 amendments to the bill Nineteen of hisamendmentshalf of themwere agreed to Of those that were offered15 were not agreed toall by rollcall vote So 13 amendments offeredby the Senator from Oklahoma were included in the bill that is beforeus todayHe has questioned whether the current procedure gives him anopportunity to offer amendments The fact is we are now on our 21stday of considering health care reform Exactly 4 amendments have beenoffered by the Republican side of the aisle 4 substantive amendmentsto change provisions in this bill of 2000 pagesin 21 days 4amendments They offered six motions to stop the debate send the billback to committee They were generic motions They did not ask forspecific changes They just take on an issue in the bill and say Sendit back to the committee and tell them to solve this problem and thenbring it back to the floor at a later time Well that is kind of aprocedural and if I might say political statement more than asubstantive statement about a provision in the billSo exactly four amendments have been offered by the Republican sideof the aisle that deal with substance Some of their efforts have beenin protection of the health insurance industry particularly a programcalled Medicare Advantage which was created by private healthinsurance companies to prove to government they could provide Medicaremore cheaplySome did but most did not and now we are paying up to 17 billion ayear subsidizing private health insurance companies that told us at thestart We will save you money It turns out they are costing us moneya lot of moneyand many of us think it is wasteful We would ratherhave that money spent on basic Medicare making certain there issolvency in Medicare and a good strong futureSo when you look at the state of the situation we are now on acloture motion to bring a close to the debate on health care reformafter almost 3weeks and four Republican amendmentsonly four were offered Therenever was a Republican substitute no Republican proposal for healthcare reform We have been told this might exist We have never seen itOf the four amendments they offered not one was this substitute thatwas going to deal with the health care system It is a promise that hasnot been kept They kept saying It is coming Pretty soon we are justgoing to put this thing right in the Record Well it never happenedIn 3 weeks it never happenedIt is hard work to prepare a substitute The reason this took so longand has dragged on for so long is we had to take every page of this andturn it over to the Congressional Budget Office They sit there withtheir economists pore over it and say Well is it going to add to thedeficit or reduce the deficit Is it going to reduce health care costsWhat is the impact It takes them some time to do that The Republicansknow if they are going to have a substitute it will have to go throughthe same rigorous appraisal and they have not done that I thinkbecause it is hard In fact from their political point of view itmight be impossible to try to solve the problems facing health care inAmerica without taking the path we have takenWhat does this bill do The basics are obvious Firstand this isall backed up by the Congressional Budget Officeit will reduce thecost of health care It will make it more affordable A health carepolicy for a family of four offered by an employer on average cost6000 10 years ago Today it costs 12000 a year It has doubled in10 years and in 8 years it will double again to 24000 We have toslow this down or it will reach a point where more and more people willbe uninsured fewer businesses will offer health insurance and moreindividuals will find themselves unable to afford the basic protectionsthey need for themselves and their familiesSo the Congressional Budget Office tells us we reduce the growth inthe cost of health care and that is a good thing They came throughwith a dramatic revelation yesterday when they said this bill willreduce our deficit as well If the cost of health care goes down thecost of health care programs offered by government goes down They tellus in 10 years we will save 130 billion from the deficit That is adramatic savingsthe largest in history But then the news got betterThey said in the second 10 years instead of saving 650 billion fromour debt and deficit it could reach double that amount 13 trillionin savings in the second 10 yearsI would say to those who give speeches day after day about ourdeficit I invite youin fact I challenge you to come up with a billthat does this that gives us actual savings of 130 billion in 10years and 13 trillion in the next 10 years It is hard to do It maybe impossible for some to come up with such a billThis bill also will extend the coverage of health insurance so 94percent of Americans will have coverage Madam President 30 millionAmericans today who have no health insurance will have health insuranceunder this bill Half of them are poor enough that they will receiveMedicaid the other half will qualify for the insurance exchanges andother tax credits to help them pay their premiums so they can have andafford health insuranceNinetyfour percent of Americanswe have never ever achieved alevel of insured Americans that reached that number Thirty millionAmericans will be receiving health insurance at the end of the dayThis bill will start giving consumers across America protections theyneed against abuses from health insurance companies One of the thingsnear and dear to my heart about this amendment which has beencriticized by some is this amendment which was offered yesterday hasbeen on the Internet for those who are interested to read it for 24hours and will continue to be availableThis amendment says that as soon as this is signed health insurancecompanies across America cannot deny coverage to children those underthe age of 18 because of a preexisting condition That means if yourson or daughter is diagnosed with diabetes juvenile diabetes and youfind it difficult to get health insurance today because of thatpreexisting condition they will no longer be able to discriminateagainst your child and your family because of this bill That is onething There are many othersThis whole notion of health insurance companies waiting until you getsick and cut you off when you need them the most that comes to an endunder this amendment in 6 months So over and over again we giveconsumers across America a chance to have the coverage they paid forwhen they need it the most We used to call it the Patients Bill ofRights and it used to be bipartisan It was Senator Kennedy andSenator MCCain who brought it to us and it failed because the healthinsurance companies were so politically powerful But we have got themthis time If we can pass this bill we finally have the protectionsthe American people so desperately needThere are other provisions in the bill Right from the beginning weprovide more help to small businesses These are businesses with 50 25employees and an average payroll of 50000 an employee to 25000 anemployee or less For each of those businesses we say We are going tohelp you buy health insurance for the owners of the business as well asfor the employees Those are the folks who are struggling and losingcoverage people such as the realtors in your hometown Did you knowone out of four realtors in America has no health insurance I did notknow it until they came to see me Well this gives them a hand Itgives them a tax break as a small business to provide health insurancefor their peopleI am going to reserve the remainder of my time I will tell you weare here today We are burning the hours off the clock to vote at 1am in the morning It would be more humane to the people who workhere to the Members of the Senate and their families for us to reacha gentlemanly and gentlewomanly agreement that we will have this voteat a more reasonable time If we have the 60 votes which I think wehave the commitments for then we can decide how to move forwardWe have had a long arduous and sometimes taxing debate leading tothis moment I think it is time for a vote The sooner we can reachthat vote the sooner the American people will know that we will eithersucceed or fail in bringing stability and security when it comes totheir health insurance making that health insurance more affordableextending the reach and protection of health insurance to record levelsof Americans making sure we have health insurance reform as part ofthis and at the same time at the very same time reducing our deficitI reserve the remainder of our timeThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Who yields time Madam President how much time do I have remainingThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore There is 1 minute 50 seconds Madam President I wish to suggest the absence of aquorum and ask unanimous consent that the time under the quorum beallotted equally to both sidesThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Without objection it is soorderedThe clerk will call the rollThe assistant bill clerk Sara Schwartzman proceeded to call theroll  President would the Senator yield for a question Iam going to be speaking at the end of this hour that has been allocatedto our side and I dont want to interrupt the Senator from Ohio butfor one reason I dont know if the Senator from Ohio heard or is awareof a statement made earlier today by our colleague from OklahomaSenator Coburn who came to the floor and saidWhat the American people ought to pray is that somebodycant make the vote tonight That is what they ought to prayI have been trying to reach Senator Coburn because he is on acommittee on which I serve and I work with him This statement troublesme I am trying to reach him to come back to the floor and explainexactly what he meant about a Senator not being able to make the votetonightI dont know if the Senator from Ohio is familiar with thisstatement but I am reaching out to Senator Coburn I will be on thefloor in the next 45 minutes and I hope he will join meI thank the Senator from Ohio for yielding  I wish to renew myinvitation to Senator Coburn to please come to the floor but do it soonbefore my time expires I called his office to make sure he knew I wastrying to reach him I have spoken on the floor to alert the Republicanside that I wished to ask him to explain a statement he made on thefloor earlier today The statement of Senator Coburn of Oklahoma saidWhat the American people ought to pray is that somebodycant make the vote tonight Thats what they ought to prayI am troubled by this statement I want to give the Senator fromOklahoma an opportunity to explain it because the simple reality is Idont think we should be wishing misfortune on any of our Senatecolleagues on either side of the aisle I dont know if this was aninnocent statement or something he now wants to clarify But as statedit troubles meIt troubles me because I am afraid it reflects the situation we findourselves in too often in the Senate where people are literallyinvoking Gods name in prayer for political purposesin this case towish misfortune on one of our colleagues who would not be able to makeour 1 am scheduled rollcall I do not wish misfortune on any of ourcolleagues   Underthe usual business of the Senate we agree that we will do somethingmore thoughtful and humane and a vote at an earlier time Senator Reidhas approached Senator MCConnell and said we have one of our SenatorsSenator Byrd of West Virginia with significant health problems whowas been brought to the floor now early in the morning late at nightand in a wheelchair He looks better than ever I might add He isbeing asked to show up at 1 in the morning because we could not reachwhat is usual comity and gentlemanly accord on scheduling a voteIt is unfortunate because now we face this 1 am vote and with nocooperation on the other side to even change the vote for a very humanereason  President let me first acknowledge the Senator fromConnecticut who played a critical role in not only the inspiration butthe preparation of this important landmark legislation Senator Doddhas been given some tough assignments in his career He has been handedsome of the toughest and this was one His Health Education Laborand Pensions Committee met I understand 54 hours if I am notmistaken I think that is what he said earlier on the floor Itconsidered hundreds of amendments with the notion that we could createa better more effective health care system in America I have yet tohear anyone criticize his chairing that committee He was evenhandedand fair He entertained and accepted some 150 or 160 Republicanamendments to this bill in an effort to try to build some bipartisansupport for it He went the extra mile with extra hearings Hiscommittee was weary at the end but he proved that his experience inthe Senate had taught him valuable lessons about what it took to berespectful to the other side of an issue He was not rewarded with afinal vote in committee Not a single Republican Senator would vote forthe bill It was not for any lack of effort on the part of SenatorDoddWhen this bill passesand this bill will passhe deserves specialcredit for it and I am going to be one of the first to applaud him Heincluded a provision in this bill near and dear to me on congenitalheart research that will save lives and will spare suffering tofamilies across America I will forever be indebted to him for itIn just 4 hours in the early morning hours of Monday December 212009 one of the most significant votes in the history of the Senatewill take place It is hard for us in the midst of this debate afterall that has come before us and all that is likely to follow toproperly put this in historical context For those of us who werehonored by the people of our State to be here at this moment inhistory it is humbling to know we will be called on to cast a votethat can change a nationIt has happened here before but only rarely It happened 75 years agowhen other Senators in a much different era battling through theworst depression in our Nations modern history were called on by aPresident in a wheelchair to rally and stand for the elderly ofAmerica He asked to create Social Security an insurance planprimarily for widows President Franklin Roosevelt came to this Senatein this Chamber asking each and every one of the Senators to be mindfulof the plight of our parents and grandparents in that timeI can recall in my family it was not uncommon for grandparents toend up living in the same home as their children because after theyreached the point where they could no longer work for a variety ofreasonsphysical retirement whatever it happened to betheirsavings were meager and the chance of living independently was limitedSo their children took them in in that spare bedroom made them part ofthe family and welcomed but understood that was the only way mom anddad were going to have the dignity they deserved in lifeFranklin Roosevelt had a different vision He thought if workersthroughout their worklife paid a little bit of money each week into afund they could be ensured there would be a check waiting for them atretirement that would allow them independence and dignity Heprevailed and Senators stood up in that era of the 1930s and gave himthe votes that were needed to change our Nation when it came to the waywe treat the elderlyThose on the other side of the aisleRepublicanswere skepticalThey were fearful of government fearful of a new program They arguedwe were headed down a path we would regretechoes of many arguments weare hearing today in opposition to health care reform When their timecame later even as recently as a few years ago they tried todramatically change and rewrite the Social Security Program Theycalled for privatizing it saying we would be much better off if theSocial Security trust fund were actually in the stock market Thankgoodness the wisdom of America rejected that idea Within months of thesuggestion it was proven to be totally false as life savings werelost with the recession that we now are enduringIt is an indication of the bravery of a President the courage of aSenate and the fact that they rejected the pleas of those who wouldsay Do nothing Dont touch it Leave that problem aloneIt was about 45 years ago when another great President had anothergreat idea and that idea was to create Medicare and with the creationof Medicare to say to those same elderly It isnt enough to give you acheck to get by each month We want to make sure you have access todoctors and hospitals when you need it Lyndon Baines Johnson themaster of the Senate then President managed to engineer the passageof that legislation against critics who once again said It is too muchgovernment It is a program that will cost too much money It is notneeded We shouldnt do itTheir counsel was rejected Medicare was created It wasnt theMedicare we know today It didnt reach the disabled It didnt providesome of the basic services that many seniors now desperately need andit didnt cover prescription drugs but it was a start It was acritical decision made to move forward The same Republican Party thatobjected to the creation of Medicare has been critical of the programever since They have argued that it is wasteful that it is doomedthat it should be allowed to wither on the vine That was actually aquote from a leading Republican not that long agoThey suggested there was a better waylets privatize Medicare Theylove the notion of privatizing Get government out of the picture Theycame up with this theory with the health insurance industry ofsomething called Medicare Advantage This was where those flintyeyedentrepreneurs would teach government a lesson They would offer thebenefits of Medicare and show how to do it at a lower cost Well weaccepted their challenge and gave them their opportunity and what wefound was They failed Oh some succeeded but by and large when thefinal count took place those private insurance companies couldnt helpbut have the urge to maximize profits at the expense of Medicare Sonow we spend about 17 billion a year out of Medicare subsidizingprivate health insurance under the socalled Medicare AdvantageProgram The experiment has failedThe basic idea of Medicare was proven right It gave to our seniorssomething that we had promised and hoped we could deliverlongerhealthier lives It also triggered the creation of a medical healthestablishment across Americathe building of hospitals and medicalschools and more medical professionals than our Nation had ever seenbecause of Medicare because of a President Lyndon Baines Johnson andhis courage and because of a Senate that could rise to the challengeof passing it despite the criticsWell in the early hours of Monday December 21 2009 our generationof the United States Senate will face our rendezvous with destiny ouropportunity to change this Nation to make such a significant change inthe way health care is delivered in America that we can say to futuregenerations We had our moment and we seized it To think that wewillwith the passage of this bill in perhaps just a few days in theSenate and a few weeks on Capitol Hillenlarge the percentage ofAmericans with the security of health insurance from 83 percent to 94percentthe highest percentage of Americans ever insured in thehistory of our Nation Of 50 million uninsured Americans today 30million of those people will finally be able to rest at night knowingthey are covered that they have health insuranceIt will be Judy a worker in Marion IL at a hotel making 8 anhour working 30 hours a week 12000 in annual wages She is adiabetic She hasnever had health insurance in her life She goes to work every day Sheis 60 years old She will have health insurance because of this billShe will be covered by Medicaid and she wont have to pay for itbecause Judys wages are at the low end of workers in AmericaI said to her If you had health insurance Judy what would you doShe said Senator I have a few lumps I have been worried about along time and I cant afford to go to the doctor I would go to thedoctorThank God she can Thank God for a lot of othersthose who have losttheir jobs who are unemployed who have exhausted their savings whostand to lose their homeswho will at least have the peace of mindthey will have health insurance That is going to come tooIf you have a child with a health problem as many people dosomething they call a preexisting condition this bill will tell thehealth insurance companies immediately You can no longer discriminateagainst that child You cant turn down the family or that child forcoverage As someone who has been through that experience I cant tellyou what that means to know that you have that kind of coverage thatyour child with that health care challenge can go to the doctor theyneed to see and the hospital they need to be inWhen my wife and I were first married and had our first baby I wasin law school and we had no health insurance When our baby had aproblem I had to go to Childrens Hospital here in Washington and sitin a room filled with people who had no health insurance I took anumber and we waited for a doctor Every time we went it was adifferent one I felt like I had let my family down At a time when myfamily needed health insurance I had not delivered I know thatfeeling personally and I know what it must mean to 50 millionAmericans who face it today For 30 million of those Americans thisbill will give them the peace of mind that they have health insuranceIt also says to companies across America we are going to change theterms of this relationship between health insurance companies and thepeople they insure We are going to finally step in on the side of theconsumers of Americathe families of America the ones that are sooften turned down because of preexisting conditions turned downbecause companies canceled their insurance when they started runninginto high medical bills For the first time these people will havelegal rights created by this bill to stand up and be covered and to beconfident at the end of the day that they will have the coverage theypaid for their whole lifeIt is an amazing thing we are considering In the middle of it withall these speeches and all the press releases and all the charts andall the time it is sometimes difficult to focus on the historicalimpact of what we are about to do at 1 am on December 21 2009 Butif we do this and do it right if 60 Senators step forward as I thinkthey willcommitments have been madewe will make history It will bereported across America that for the first time in memory the UnitedStates Senate has voted for comprehensive health care reformThe critics will still be there and they will say the same thingthey did about Social Security and the same thing they did aboutMedicare It is too much government It is not going to work Weshouldnt do itThank God that counsel was rejected in the 1930s and the 1960s andit should be rejected on December 21 2009 We need to stand togetherfor people who otherwise have no voicethe uninsured many of whomhave lowwage jobs or maybe no jobs at all and their children whoreally cant afford the best lobbyist in Washington It is time for usto lobby for themI know there are a lot of critics of this plan We have heard themThey have talked about Medicare and what this will do to this bill Butwe know what the professionals have told us This comprehensive healthcare reform legislation will add 9 or 10 years of solvency to Medicareput Medicare on sound financial footing And that is exactly what weshould doThe bill has a bonus The bonus is that at a time when we are facingdeficits and debt which have to be taken seriously this bill charts apath for us to start retiring that debt The Congressional BudgetOffice says that over the first 10 years 130 billion in debt will berelieved by this bill then in the second decade of this billsexistence and changes we are going to find up to 13 trillion indeficit reductionThere has never been a bill considered on the floor of the Senatethat has had that kind of impact on our Nations debt It is going tochange life not only for uninsured families but even those withinsurance For some it will give the luxury that we have as Members ofCongressI think we are the luckiest people on Earth when it comes to healthinsurance We team up with 8 million Federal employees and theirfamilies and each year we have an open enrollment If we dont likethe way we are treated by our health insurance company in the previousyear we can go shopping just like you would shop for a car or arefrigerator and pick the right one for your family We pick the righthealth insurance for our families Every American should have thatluxury and we move toward creating that in this legislationIt was several years ago that I teamed up with Senator BlancheLincoln of Arkansas and Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine We tried tocreate a program for small businesses in America called the SHOP ActThis program would give those small businesses the same shoppingopportunities for health insurance as Members of Congress and Federalemployees I came up with an unlikely ally in the National Federationof Independent Businesses They decided they wanted to join usWhen their lobbyist called and said he wanted to meet with me Isaid I cant wait to meet you His organization had done everything intheir power to defeat me in every election I had been in and I wantedto see what he looked likeHe came in and sat down and said We have to do something abouthealth insurance for small business We ended up creating an unlikelybut powerful alliance of the National Federation of IndependentBusinesses the realtors the Service Employees International UnionFamilies USAfrom both sides of the political spectrumstandingbehind the SHOP billThe SHOP bill with some changes is now part of health care reformIt is an idea that has been endorsed and it is one that I think isgoing to make a big difference for individuals The bill also containshelp for small businesses to pay for the premiums Critics on the otherside of the aisle say Oh the taxes go up but the benefits dontstart for years They have missed it because initially we are going tobe offering tax assistance to small businesses with 50 employees orfewer Those who have an average payroll of 50000 a worker are goingto get a helping hand to buy health insurance not only for theirworkers but for the owner of the companyI have seen this in my own life I have friends who run a smallbusiness who have lost their health insurance because one employeeswife had a very sick baby That is exactly what happened to my friendThey went out shopping for insurance on the open market and it wasbrutal My friends were in their early sixties and they couldnt buyinsurance Everything they could buy was loaded with exclusions anddeductibles and copaysWell we are going to make sure that businesses have a helping handwith a tax credit and that helping hand is going to allow them to buygood insurance that covers their employeesThose on the other side talk about the tax increases in this billLets be very blunt what they are There is a 9 percent payroll taxincrease for individuals making over 200000 a year and familiesmaking over 250000 a year What it means is this Roughly 2000 ayear for families making over 250000 will have to be paid to makesure that Medicare is solvent and that this program is funded That mayaffect some Members of Congress with their spouses working But Idont think it is unfair It is a tax we should be willing to pay tosolve major problems in this countryThere will be taxes on highend health insurance policies and it isa very controversial provision with some of my friends in organizedlabor But Ihope we have hit the right number of 23000 and I hope our escalatorclause to try to keep up with inflation is a reasonable one If it isnot we will revisit it The only law ever written that didnt needamendment might have been the Ten Commandments and I dont think thisbill as good as it is will rise to that level We are prepared toreturn to it if we need to to make sure it works and works well andwe have the time to do thatThis is critical I also know this bill is going to changeyou willbe able to see the change across America with the construction ofcommunity health clinics One of our great Senators here BernieSanders of Vermont has been a clarion voice on behalf of communityhealth clinics He knows as we all do that these clinics placed incities and towns across America are a lifeline to lowincome people sothat they have primary care at a fraction of the cost of a visit to anemergency roomgood care I have seen it I have visited the ErieClinic in Chicago Alia Clinic in Chicago These are good cleanmodern clinics with people dedicated to health care and dentistry whoare helping these peopleWe envision 10000 more community health clinics as a result of thisbill at least and thousands of primary care physicians to be there tohelp That will mean we will be creating across America a network ofcare and peace of mind for people who otherwise have few places ifany to turnI think the day will come soon when this bill after it is passedwill become evident to America in terms of what we set out to do andwhat we achieved If history serves as it has in the past many oftodays critics will not dwell on the fact that they voted no butrather say I had some problems with it I guess it worked out OK Theymay be afraid to acknowledge that now I think ultimately they willhave toThis is clearly an idea whose time has come and it has come becausewe have a President with the courage the political courage to step upand make sure that we not back away As Franklin Roosevelt did inSocial Security as Lyndon Johnson did with Medicare Barack Obamawith health care reform has challenged this Congress not to ignore aproblem that has haunted the Presidencies of seven great men who havepreviously served in that officeWe need to do our historic duty in the early morning hours so thatAmericans across this Nation can wake up to the stories on the newsthat finally hope is on the wayI said the other night when I was talking about thisSenator Doddput Vicki Kennedys Washington Post column in the Record and I am gladhe did sothat this has been called many things It has an officialname I am going to call it Kennedy Care I hope some others willtoo because we do it because of the inspiration of a great friend agreat Senator and a great statesman Edward Kennedy who I am sorrycannot be here to enjoy this historic moment But he led us to thismoment As he said in one of his last columns he wrote about healthcare We are almost there In four hours we will be thereI yield the floor
S_SD_THUNE,2009-12-04, 2901and ask for its immediate consideration President I want to speak to the amendment that wejust filed at the desk This amendment is very straightforward and verysimple It does what a number of my colleagues on the other side haveasked to do and that is to strike the CLASS Act from the underlyinghealth care reform bill that is being debated on the floor of theSenate right nowI want to read some excerpts from a letter that seven DemocraticSenators including the chairman of the Senate Budget CommitteeSenator Conrad put together asking that this CLASS Act not be includedas part of this legislationMr President I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Recordthe letter from which I will be quotingThere being no objection the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record as followsUS SenateWashington DC October 23 2009Hon Harry ReidMajority Leader The Capitol Washington DCDear Leader Reid We write regarding the merger of theFinance and HELP Committee health reform bills We know youface a great many difficult decisions now one of which iswhether to include provisions from the HELP Committee billknown as the CLASS Act in the merged billWe urge you not to include these provisions in the Senatesmerged bill nor to use the savings as an offset for otherhealth items in the mergerWhile the goals of the CLASS Act are laudablefinding away to provide long term care insurance to individualstheeffect of including this legislation in the merged Senatebill would not be fiscally responsible for several reasonsCBO currently estimates the CLASS Act would reduce thedeficit by 73 billion over ten years But nearly all thesavings result from the fact that the initial payout ofbenefits wouldnt begin until 2016 even though the programbegins collecting premiums in 2011 It is also clear that thelegislation increases the deficit in decades following thefirst ten years CBO has confirmed that the legislationstandalone would face a longterm deficit point of order inthe SenateSome have argued that the program is actuarially sound Butthis is the case because premiums are collected and placed ina trust fund which begins earning interest and because theHHS Secretary is instructed to increase premiums to maintainactuarial solvency We have grave concerns that the realeffect of the provisions would be to create a new federalentitlement program with large longterm spending increasesthat far exceed revenues This is especially the case ifsavings from the first decade of the program are spent onother health reform prioritiesSlowing the growth of health care costs should be a toppriority as we move forward with health reform Inclusion ofthe CLASS Act would reduce the amount of longterm costsavings that would otherwise occur in the merged bill TheCLASS Act bends the health care cost curve in the wrongdirection and should not be used to help pay for other healthprovisions that will become more expensive over time andincrease deficitsThank you for your consideration We hope that fiscallyresponsible measures to improve access to longterm care canbe considered in the futureSincerelyKent ConradJoe LiebermanMary L LandrieuEvan BayhBlanche L LincolnE Benjamin NelsonMark R WarnerUS Senators President the letter saidWe urge you not to include these provisions in the Senatesmerged bill nor to use the savings as an offset for otherhealth items in the merger While the goals of the CLASS Actare laudablefinding a way to provide long term careinsurance to individualsthe effect of including thislegislation in the merged Senate bill would not be fiscallyresponsible for several reasonsThe letter goes on to sayNearly all the savings result from the fact that theinitial payout of benefits wouldnt begin until 2016 eventhough the program begins collecting premiums in 2011 It isalso clear that the legislation increases the deficit indecades following the first 10 yearsThey go on to say in this letter Mr PresidentWe have grave concerns that the real effect of theprovisions would be to create a new Federal entitlementprogram with large longterm spending increases that farexceed revenues This is especially the case if savings fromthe first decade of the program are spent on other healthreform prioritiesThat Mr President is a letter that was signed by the chairman ofthe Senate Budget Committee Senator Conrad of North Dakota SenatorLieberman Senator Landrieu Senator Lincoln Senator Warner SenatorNelson and Senator Bayh Seven Democratic Senators have gone on therecord saying the CLASS Act shouldnt be included in this legislationbecause it is not fiscally responsibleThe fact is the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee SenatorConrad has described this as a Ponzi scheme of the first ordersomething that Bernie Madoff would be proud ofNow I have heard my colleagues get up and talk about how solventthis is and what a great program this is Well there are programs outthere that are available for people to buy longterm care insuranceThe problem with this one is that it takes all the money that comes inin the early years and spends it on other government programsin thiscase health care reformbut who knows what other government programsare going to be created that will use the revenues that come in fromthis plan that supposedly a lot of people are going to sign up for andCBO says it is going to be fewer than 4 percent that will sign upIn fact no senior today is going to benefit from it because you haveto work for 5 years If you are a senior who is retired you will notsee any benefit This doesnt impact seniors contrary to the assertionof some of my colleagues on the other side It will impact futuregenerations of Americans who are going to be stuck with the deficitsand the debt that gets piled on them because of the outyears when thisliability is incurred as people start getting paid out from havingpaid in and there is no money there It is the classic definition of aPonzi scheme The money comes in today it gets spent on other thingsand then someday when the liability comes in and people start sayingI paid into this program and I should get some benefit there will beno money there So we will borrow for it or tax for it or somethingelseThey say well it is actuarially solvent over 75 years Well maybebecause you are running surpluses in the early years But in the lateryears you are running huge deficits In the early years the surplusesare being spent They are not being put into paying benefits for thisprogram when those benefits start being demanded by the people whohave participated in the programJust look at what others have said about this program Mr PresidentI have quoted for you what the chairman of the Budget CommitteeSenator Conrad said with regard to this program that it is a Ponzischeme of the first order and that is being echoed by others But thisis what the administrations chief health actuary said about the CLASSAct He said it would result in a net Federal cost in the longerterm The chief actuary also determined the program faces asignificant risk of failure because the high cost will attract sickerpeople and lead to low participationThe Congressional Budget Office agreed sayingThe CLASS program included in the bill would generate netreceipts for the program in the initial years when totalpremiums would exceed total benefit payments but it wouldeventually lead to net outlays when benefits exceed premiums   In the decade following 2029 the CLASS program wouldbegin to increase budget deficitsThis particular quote could come as a bit of a surprise because thiscomes not from the CBO or the CMS actuary but it comes from theWashington Post The Washington Post called the CLASS Act a gimmickdesigned to pretend that health care is fully paid for The Postgoes on to sayThe money that flows in during the 10 year budget windowwill flow back out again These are not savings that canhonestly be counted on the balance sheet of reformEven the Washington Post recognizes this for what it is It is asham This is a budget gimmick Mr President that is designed toobscure the cost of this program by generating surpluses in the earlyyears It is supposed to generate 72 billion in the first 10yearwindow so that counts on the balance sheet of health care reform tomake it look better But this program is going to run deficitsdeficits as far the eye can seeonce the chickens come home to roostWho will pay the bill for that Future generations of AmericansMr President this is not good policy Certainly if you look atprograms we already have on the books Medicare is destined to bebankrupt in the year 2017 We have big problems down the roadunfundedliabilities in Social Security This would create a huge new liabilitydown the road that would be unfunded because all the money that comesin during the early years is going to be spent This is more of thesame old business as usual in Washington DC that the American peopleare fed up with We can make people happy today by saying we arecreating this new program that makes the majoritys health care reformbill look better because it obscures the real cost of this bill byrolling in these revenues in the early years But there is a longtermimpact according to the CBO according to the actuary at Health andHuman Services and according to a lot of our colleagues on the othersidethe seven Democrats who signed the letter including the chairmanof the Budget Committee who as I said has called this program aPonzi scheme of the first order something that would make BernieMadoff proudI dont know how my colleagues on the other side with a straightface can come to the Senate floor and say this is a great programthat it is actuarially sound Sure it may be a benefit to a fewpeople but I have to tell you somewhere down the road when thechickens come home to roost there is going to be a huge liability thatis going to be facing future taxpayers future generations ofAmericans as we start to pile up more deficits and more debt as aresult of this Ponzi schemeThis is a sham Mr President I hope my colleagues will support thisamendment It would strike the CLASS Act from the underlying bill notallow those revenues to be assumed in paying for or understating thecost of this bill and not pile mountains of debt onto futuregenerationsMr President I reserve the remainder of my time  President the CLASS Act is the same old Washingtonsame old smoke and mirrors same old games I wish to read what theCongressional Budget Office and the chief actuary for theadministration have saidThe program would add to future Federal budget deficits inlarge and growing fashionIf we dont take this out of this legislation if we allow this tobecome law we are locking in future generations to deficits and debtas far as the eye can see This is as has been described by the otherside a Ponzi scheme of the highest order We need to take it out ofthis billI urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment
S_AK_MURKOWSKI,2009-12-03, Is that better  The Senator just missed all the kind remarks Idirected to her attention  I will make sure those comments that were made for theRecord will be delivered to the Senator personallyI want to reiterate some points I made yesterday about my amendmentand I will also share with my colleagues I know the Senator from Texasmentioned it as well the CBO score we received late last evening Itprovides us with a score showing a cost savings of 14 billion overthe next 10 years I think this is significant as Members certainlyfrom the other side raised the importance of fiscal discipline and ourfiduciary responsibility here Importantly the CBO indicated theprovisions on the second page which prevent the Secretary from usingthe recommendations of the USPSTF to deny coverage would cost moneywhich means we are protecting certain benefits and that is veryimportantThe amendment we will have before us the Murkowski amendment is onethat allows or requires a level of transparency with the recommendedhealth screenings prevention services that are deemed necessary not bysome task force that is appointed by folks within the administrationnot by some commission that has political relationships What we areurging is that the health screenings the preventive services bedetermined by those who are actually in the field thosepractitionersthose who are engaged in oncology OBGYNs We need tobe looking to the experts We need to be looking to that peerreviewedscience We dont need to be looking to those entities that have beenbrought together by a government entity or by the Secretary We need tobe looking to the likes of the American Society of Clinical Oncologythe American College of Surgeons the American College of RadiationOncology the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology We need tolook to their recommendationsAgain as I mentioned yesterday in my comments if you go to theirWeb sites if you look to their specific recommendations they willgive guidance guidance that again is based on their practice inoncology their practice as an OBGYN Look to what they set out as theguidelines for cervical cancer screening for mammograms and let thatinformation be made available publicly through the pamphlets the plansthat come together from the insurance companies But allow themallowme as a consumer of health care me as a consumer looking for the bestplan for me and my familyto know what those guidelines are not froma government task force but from those who are the real experts Ithink this is the transparency that health care shoppers are lookingforSome have suggested Lisa your amendment doesnt require theinsurance companies to provide any prevention or screening servicesThere is no mandate in there If we do not have a mandate then theinsurance companies are not going to provide health care prevention andscreening servicesI think we need to ask the question here what is the point ofprevention It is to prevent more expensive care in the future bypreventing the chronic and more acute illnesses So should not theinsurance companies want to utilize more preventive services utilizemore screenings more wellness services in order to keep down thecosts of care based on the judgment of the doctors based on thejudgment of the professionals and not necessarily those who againare part of a government entityI know within my staff I have a member who is on the FEHBP plan butthey contact her on a somewhat regular basis about her diabetes careensuring she is taking her medications getting the necessarypreventive services offered by her insurer for her particularconditionIt has been mentioned by several of my colleagues that this USPSTF isnot such a bad group of guys they are not just these namelessfaceless bureaucrats I think it is important to recognize and eventhe American Heart Association has recognized it that the PreventiveServices Task Force is limited to only primary care doctors and notspecialists such as the oncologists the cancer doctors who seepatients every day battling cancer These doctors who are providingAmericans with their suggestions on what services are necessary forcancer screenings but yet these doctors are not part of this taskforce have again shone the spotlight on what happens when you have agovernment entity or government task force that is basically the onesaying this is what is going to be covered this is not what is goingto be covered In my amendment we specifically provide that therecommendations from USPSTF cannot be used to deny coverage of an itemor service by a group health plan or health insurance offeror I thinkthat is very importantI think it is also important to recognize that what we do in myamendment is make sure the health plans consult the recommendations andguidelines of the professional medical organizations to determine whatprevention benefits should be covered by these health insurance plansthroughout the countryWe also require plans to provide this information directly to theindividuals You get to see it for yourself You get to make thatdetermination So what that means is the doctors and the specialistswill be recommending what preventive services to cover not those inWashington DCMy amendment ensures that the Secretary of Health and Human Servicesshall not use any of the recommendations again made by the task forceto deny coverage We also include broad protections to preventbureaucrats at the Department of Health and Human Services from denyingcare to patients based on comparative effectiveness research Andfinally we have a provision that ensures the Secretary of Health andHuman Services may not define or classify abortion or abortion servicesas preventive care or as preventive services I think my amendment isstraightforward I think it is a good compromise and again it is aclear differential between what we are going to do to allow a woman tohave full choice with her doctor as opposed to government telling uswho we should be seeingAmendment No 2836 to Amendment No 2786Mr President I ask consent to call up my amendment No 2836 I ask unanimous consent that further reading of theamendment be dispensed with  President I want to start my comments byacknowledging my colleague from Maryland and accept her gracious offerto continue to work on this issue as it relates to womens health andwomens health services As has been noted by the Senator from Marylandand the Senator from Washington this is an issue that we women of theSenate have come together on repeatedly to work cooperatively Whilewe do have some would say somewhat dueling amendments here I thinkit is important to recognize the goals we are both seeking to attainhere are certainly right in alignment We are just choosing differentmeans to get there But I appreciate again the civility andcooperation from not only Senator Mikulski but the other women of theSenate on this very important issueI wish to reiterate a couple of points about my amendment that I madeyesterday  President the purpose of this amendment is toensure we do not have government entities that are making thosedecisions we as individuals working with our doctors feel is bestThe intent behind this amendment is to ensure that those medicalprofessional organizations whether it is the American Society ofClinical Oncology or the American College of Surgeons or the AmericanCollege of Radiation Oncology or the American Society of Obstetriciansand Gynecologiststhose who are in the practice those who are makingthe recommendationsthese are the individuals we want to know arebeing consulted not some entity that has been created by those of usin the government or by some administration by some SecretarySo what we propose with this amendment is an insurance offering ifyou will You will know fully what is part of your plan It is you andyour doctor making these decisionsI urge a yes vote on this amendment
S_AZ_KYL,2009-12-20, President I appreciate the comments my colleague fromMontana made I think the point my colleague earlier was trying to makewas that we just got the bill yesterday and have not gotten a full CBOor final CBO score that the correction simply revealed the fact thereis a lot there to digest and we ought to have more time to understandexactly how the interrelated pieces of the bill work how all the CBOscoring relates and so on When CBO can make about a 600 billionerror as I understand that is a big error So there is probably moreand a lot we dont understand It would be helpful if we had more timeto understand this and how it all works and that was the point mycolleague was making I believeBut I do appreciate my colleague pointing out it is better we work ingood faith and for the most part I certainly recall the longconversations the ranking Republican Senator Grassley and thechairman of the committee had I know they worked in good faith and itwould be best if we did that It is to that end I wish to speak to somecomments a colleague made earlier todayI dont know whether it is frustration or maybe just the lens throughwhich partisans view things and their opponents unfortunately thatspawned the remarks earlier today from one of our Democraticcolleagues but in either event his characterization of his Republicancolleagues I think requires responseHe began by talking about the malignant and vindictive passions thathave descended on the Senate Here is what he said and I am quoting   too many colleagues are embarked on a desperate noholds barred mission of propaganda obstruction and fearHistory cautions us of the excesses to which these malignantvindictive passions can ultimately lead Tumbrils have rolledthrough taunting crowds broken glass has sparkled indarkened streets strange fruit has hung from southern treesI couldnt believe my ears these references to Kristallnacht one ofthe first and most vicious attacks on the Jews by the Nazis andhanging of Blacks The majority leaders remarks last week comparingthe Republicans position on health care to the proslavery movementremain largely ignored as the clumsy offhand remarks of a partisanbut the references earlier today appeared not to be offthecuffmistakes but prepared text deliberately delivered by one of thebrighter minds of the SenateOur colleague went on to acknowledge and I quote again   that in the heat of those vindictive passions somepeople earnestly believed they were justified Such is thehuman capacity for intoxication by those malignant andvindictive political passionsWell yes Republican Senators do believe our position is justifiedin fact correct There are honorable people on both sides of the aislewho obviously have to agree to disagree But our colleague attributesno good motive to Republicans whose passions are simply malignantand vindictive He adduces evidence to support his claim First anunnamed editor of the Manchester Inquirer who wrote that the GOP hasgone crazy and an unnamed economist who believes our party has beentaken over by the irrational right A Philadelphia columnist talkedabout lunacy on the Republican rightFurther quoting now     it has gone crazy is more and moredominated by the lunatic fringe and has poisoned itself with hateI wonder if my colleagues believe our position is animated by hatredWhy else would we oppose this legislation Well he answers thatquestion too It is because he says first of all   to break the momentum of our new young President Theyare desperate to break this President They have ardentsupporters who are nearly hysterical at the very election ofPresident Barack Obamathe birthers the fanatics thepeople running around in rightwing militias and Aryansupport groups It is unbearable to them that PresidentBarack Obama should exist That is one powerful reason It isnot the only oneWell talk about vindictive passions Does my colleague believe thatis why I oppose the legislationor my colleague John MCCain I hate todisappoint some folks but I dont care about the political fortunes ofthe President at least not right now I may about 3 years from now Idont like this bill That is why I oppose itMy colleague says there is another reason He says it is theinsurance industry which he proceeded to demonize I am not one todefend the insurance industry but it is strange to see it so demonizedby my colleague whose party brags of getting another 30 million peopleinsured by what The insurance industry Why subject these folks tosuch awful torture But the real irony is the legislation which weoppose the insurance industry supported It made a deal with the Obamaadministration and key Senate Democrats You mandate that everyAmerican has to buy one of our policies and we will support your billThere was a deal all right but it was between the insurance industryand key Democrats The insurance industry obviously didnt dictate theRepublican position which largely opposes the individual mandateWell finally our colleague also accused Republicans of engaging insomething else He said we were engaged in a   campaign of falsehood about death panels and cuts toMedicare benefits and benefits for illegal aliens andbureaucrats to be parachuted in between you and your doctorHe went on to stateOur colleagues terrify the public with this parade ofimagined horrors They whip up concerns and anxiety   then they tell us the public is concerned about the billSo the reason the public is opposed to the bill is because of thepower of Republican Senators to terrify our constituents about imaginedhorrors Let us look at the examples givenI dont know of any Republican Senator who has characterized thehealth care rationing as coming from death panels I heard that phrasein another context We have tried to discuss the provisions of the billwe believe do result in rationing The chairman of the committee and Ihave had a lot of debate on this subject I wish Senator Roberts and Icould offer a couple of the amendments we wanted to offer to make surethere is no rationing in the bill I think it is a real problem andshould be debated on its meritsThe benefits for illegal aliens I suspect he was referring there tothe House debate but it is still the case that there are completelyinadequate provisions in the bill to verify eligibility for benefitsYou can even apply by telephone so just about anybody could apply forsome of the benefitsThird the matter of Medicare benefits I dont think we areterrorizing our constituents about Medicare benefits unless theyunderstand the facts and the facts are that Medicare benefits aregoing to be cut The Congressional Budget Office says the MedicareAdvantage benefits are going to be reduced from a monthly actuarialvalue of 135 down to 49 a month That is CBO saying there is going tobe reduction in the benefits for those who have the private MedicareAdvantage policies That includes dental vision hearing vision carefitness and a variety of other programsWe have had a semantic debate in this Chamber between those who sayWell the fundamental benefits of the Medicare law are not specificallyeliminated or reduced in the legislative language of the bill That istrue But what is also true is the additional benefits in MedicareAdvantage are being reduced That is unassailable It is also trueandCMS for example refers to thisthat enrollment is going to bereduced because of these reductions in benefits They talk about thelower benchmarks and they say when it is fully phased in enrollmentin Medicare Advantage plans would decrease by about 33 percent So thisis not some kind of fantasy This is taken from the CongressionalBudget Office and from the CMS ActuaryFinally in addition to the Medicare Advantage the Actuary sayssimulations by the Office of the Actuary suggest that roughly 20percent of party providers that is hospitals nursing homes homehealth care would be unprofitable within the 10year projection periodas a result of productivity adjustments That means they would go outof business Obviously senior care is going to be affected by thislegislation and we believe negatively so That is an honest debate tohave and it is one which we would like to haveBut finally my colleague turned the world upside down by arguingthe only reason we are here the week before Christmas is because ofRepublican bad behavior that we ruined the holidays for theprofessional staff because we followed the procedures of the Senatethat require the reading of the billIt is true that requirement is usually waived but then we usuallyhave plenty of time to know what is in a bill Usually a bill worksits way through committee and both parties know what is in it We bothhelp to write the bill It is transparent It is usually printed longbefore it comes to the Senate floor so we know what is in it Thereason it was read was so our staff would in fact have time to readit to advise usbecause we didnt all have time to read itourselvesand to advise the public our constituents of what is init Again we received it yesterday and we are voting on it tonightThat is very little time to know everything that is in thereThe more we learn about what is in there the angrier a lot of peopleget The special deals for one State for example are simply wrongThat is why you take time to see what is in it The majority of thepublic according to opinion polls want us to take more time tounderstand what is in this billA final point on this I have to say the majority leader dictatesthe schedule of the Senate All Senators are pretty much equal but themajority leader has two things he can do and only he can do He has theright of first recognition and he has the right to set the scheduleBy the schedule I mean when he files a cloture motion which is whatbrings this bill to the floor or this amendment to the floor When hefiles the cloture motion that is what determines when the vote willbe He determines when to bring the Senate back in session Under therules an hour after he brings us back in session the cloture motionripens and we have a voteHe can set that time at any time He can say tomorrow morning at 9am the Senate will come back in session and we will vote at 10 amThe leader could do that That is his right and he is the only one whohas the right to do that But instead he says we will come in at 1minute past midnight tonight Therefore the vote will be 1 minute past1 am tomorrow morning It is his right to do thatWe didnt do that he did that He is the only one who has the rightto set that schedule If he wanted to set a schedule that was a littlemore convenient for all the Membersincluding our dear friend theSenator from West Virginia who is ill and indeed does have to get outof a bed to come in a wheelchair to this Chamberthe majority leaderhas it within his power to say we will do it at a more convenient timeWhy would he do it in this way Because he has deliberately decidedand all majority leaders have not done quite this but have done similarthingsto set a recess and then work us up against the recess so wewill have an incentive to finish It is usually a pretty goodincentive Certainly going home for Christmas is a big incentive Sothe majority leader figures if he can schedule this bill and thevarious votes in such a way that we end up voting on it on ChristmasEve that maybe then we will hurry up and try to do it because as oneDemocratic staffer is quoted as saying We need to hurry up and passthis bill because the longer it hangs around the harder it will bemeaning to pass it That is true The more the public finds out aboutit the less they like itSo the majority leader is trying to get it done as quickly as he canand as quickly as he can means scheduling us for a vote 1 hourafter we comein Since there has to be an intervening dayand today is theintervening daytonight at 1 minute after midnight we will reconvenefor the next day and then have the vote at 1 am It is purely themajority leaders decision to do it that way Republicans have nothingto do with itIf I had my way we would vote at 10 oclock in the morning But thatis not the way it is going to be So please dont say it is Republicanbad behavior that results in having to vote on this bill late at nightThe process is determined by the majority leaderI guess I am going to conclude by saying I dont believe this billcan be sold on its merits and I think that is another reason why wehave to hurry up and do itbefore the public figures out what is init The public opposes this bill not for the reasons imagined by mycolleague but because it will cut Medicare benefits it will increaseinsurance premiumsnot cause them to go downit will raise taxes putthe government in charge of too much it will cost trillions ofdollars and it will result in the delay and denial of care That iswhy the majority of Americans want us to start over and address theproblems on a stepbystep basisI was amused by my counterpart the Democratic whip sayingRepublicans have only offered four amendments I think it was seven butsay it is four Guess who determines how many amendments we get tooffer The majority leader He sets that schedule as well He says nowit is our turn to offer an amendment Then it is your turn The way hemanaged the schedule we only got to file either four or sevenamendments We have 200 amendments pending We would love to get asmany of these pending and voted on as possible Believe me it is notRepublicans who dont want to vote on our amendments The majorityleader again has set the scheduleThis is why we oppose the bill It is why we dont like the processWe respect what our constituents are telling us We believe this billwill be bad for them and it will be bad for our country OurDemocratic colleagues have a different position Neither their positionnor ours is malignant nor should they be expressed vindictively  President a lot of attention has been paid to theposition of the senior Senator from Nebraska on this legislation Page98 of the amendment provides that the State of Nebraska is carved outfrom being responsible for paying for additional Medicaid patientsadded under the bill It is the only State explicitly carved out fromthis requirementI address this as well to the chairman of the committeeI ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside andit be in order to offer an amendment to extend to all States the samebenefit that provides 100 percent Federal funding to the State ofNebraska for their expanded Medicaid Program This would give the sametreatment to other States that currently only Nebraska would enjoyunder this bill If the bill is a good thing for all States then itseems to me it should be applied equally to all States
S_MA_KERRY,2009-12-05, Madam President I will yield myself such time as I willuseThere have been times during this debate that I have listened withastonishment to the minority They agree with the diagnosisthat ourhealth care system is in need of treatment But they offer no remedyno prescription no cureWe dont need a second opinion on what the problems are with ourhealth care system Our country leads the world in the advancement ofmedical science We have the best doctors the best technology and thebest hospitals in the world It is no surprise to see kings and queenscome to the United States for medical treatmentBut for all that the system is dysfunctional wasteful and abusiveIt rewards quantity over quality And it delivers profits more thancare It is a system in which too many American families are just oneillness or one injury away from financial ruinI would like to thank Majority Leader Reid Chairman Baucus ChairmanDodd and Chairman Harkin for getting us to this important point in ourlong march toward a health care system that is affordable and availableto all Americans Their efforts have presented us an opportunity tocast a vote that will make life better for every single American Itisnt often that we get a chance to do that But we have that chancenowI know the majority leader the Senate Finance Committee and theHealth Education Labor and Pensions Committees have each tirelesslyworked on the provisions in this bill and have taken great care toensure that Medicare beneficiaries will maintain access to theirguaranteed benefits and will receive additional preventive benefits andexpanded prescription drug coverageThe amendment offered Senator Johanns is very similar to the MCCainamendment we debated over the last few days Once again the opponentsof this bill are endorsing the status quo that leaves Medicare on thebrink of going bankrupt and seniors facing higher costs My amendmentsimply ensures that no beneficiary would receive a reduction in theirguaranteed Medicare home health benefitLet me remind my colleagues again what will happen if we stick withthe status quo The status quo means Medicare will be broke inapproximately 8 years The status quo means seniors will continuepaying higher and higher premiums and costsharing due to wastefuloverpayments to providers The status quo means that each year billionsof Medicare dollars will continue to be wasted on lining the pockets ofprivate insurance companies And the status quo means that seniors willcontinue struggling to pay for prescription drugsThe stakes for seniors and for the Medicare Program have never beenhigher Senators have a choice Endorse the status quo or strengthenMedicare Regarding Medicare changes for home health providers let medescribe what is in the Senate billAs most of my colleagues would agree home health care is animportant benefit in the Medicare Program Today more than 3 millionMedicare beneficiaries receive home health services across thecountryincluding those with acute illnesses and injuries and thoseafflicted with numerous chronic conditionsAcross the country more than 9800 home health agencies provide careto seniors in their homes This care helps seniors get better and avoidexpensive rehospitalizations Home health providers make a realdifference in improving seniors health We should support theireffortsWhile I have great respect for the services of home health providerswe also have a responsibility to protect the Medicare Program As partof this we must make sure Medicare is paying appropriatelyand notoverpayingfor Medicare services We must also take action to root outfraud and abuse in the Medicare Program I believe the policies in theSenate bill achieve both goalsFirst the Senate bill would rebase home health payments toensure payments reflect actual costs of providing care These changesare based on MedPAC recommendations which is the nonpartisan groupthat advises Congress on MedicareWhen the current home health payments were set seniors received anaverage of 31 visits per episode Today they only receive 22 visitsThe Senate bill directs CMS to rebase payments to reflect thischange That is common senseThe Senate bill also roots out fraud in the system by revising howMedicare pays for outlier cases Medicare provides an extra paymenttoday for providers who treat sicker or outlier patientsUnfortunately the GAO foundthat some providers were gaming the system and getting more outlierpayments than they deserveFor example GAO found that in one Florida County providers werereceiving 60 percent of all total outlier paymentseven though thecounty had less than 1 percent of the total Medicare populationClearly something was going on there that needs to be changedThe Senate bill addresses this problem by placing a cap on the amountany individual provider can receive in outlier payments In additionit establishes a productivity adjustment for home health providersbeginning in 2015 These changes ask home health providerslike allother providersto offer more efficient and higher quality care overtimeI believe the Senate policies are fair and reasonable In makingthese changes we worked closely with the home health industry toensure these changes were reasonable and fair On the rebasing policyMedPAC recommended we fully implement these changes in 2011 To ensureproviders could adapt to the new payment rates the Senate bill phasesin the changes over 4 years The home health providers support thisphaseinThe outlier policy and fraud changes were actually suggested by thehome health industry The home health industry fully supports thesechanges For the productivity changes the Senate bill holds off onapplying these reductions while the rebasing policy is taking effectThis will give providers extra time to adapt to the payment changesand is much less aggressive than the proposals put forth by MedPAC theHouse bill and the administration which require all of these paymentchanges to be implemented at the same timeFinally the Senate bill includes special protections for rural homehealth providers From 20102015 rural providers will receive a 3percent extra payment each year This payment will ensure that ruralproviders are protected as we reform the broader home health system Intotal the Medicare delivery reforms in the Senate bill strike a fairbalance between ensuring seniors have access to care while alsorooting out inappropriate payments from the systemThe opponents of these Medicare changes do not have a plan to protectseniors and strengthen the Medicare Program They advocate doingnothing The opponents of health reform are now claiming that Medicarebeneficiaries will be harmed by this bill And here is what AARPforexamplehas said about these claimsAARPOpponents of health reform wont rest They are usingmyths and misinformation to distort the truth and wronglysuggesting that Medicare will be harmed After a lifetime ofhard work dont seniors deserve betterI would like to remind my colleagues of the positive changes in thebill It improves the solvency of the Medicare Program by 5 years Itputs 30 billion back into the pockets of seniors in the form of lowerMedicare premiums It makes prescription drugs more affordable Itguarantees that seniors can continue to see the doctor of theirchoosing It provides free wellness and prevention benefits to Medicarebeneficiaries And it also includes fair and appropriate changes forhome health that protect access to careThe truth is the Johanns amendment is harming seniors harming theMedicare Program and harming taxpayers For this reason I urge mycolleagues to oppose the amendment by Senator Johanns and to support myhome health amendment which ensures that no beneficiary would receive areduction in their guaranteed Medicare home health benefitI just listened to my friend Senator Grassley He and I have a goodrelationship we work together here we both serve on the FinanceCommittee I have enjoyed a lot of the things we do together Clearlywhatever I am saying is going to be substantive but there is nothingpersonal in it I have to say there is a lack of reality here in a lotof the comments we are hearing from our friends on the other side ofthe aisle and a persistance in perpetuating a mythA lot have seen the politics of this country where if you saysomething over and over no matter how true it is it can have animpact I know that personally But let me tell you I heard theSenator from Iowa sayI am going to quote him I wrote it downCertainly if 450 billion is being taken out of Medicareit is hurting MedicareThat is what he said Let me review what is happening here I want togo back to the comments of the Republican nominee for President lastyear This is a quote John MCCain from an article in the Wall StreetJournalJohn MCCain would pay for his health care plan with majorreductions to Medicare and Medicaid a top aide said in amove that independent analysts estimate could result in cutsof 13 trillionAfter I said that on the floor the Senator from North CarolinaSenator Burr stood up and saidHave you seen factcheckorgI said I havent read the specific article but we didnt see thatcorrected in the course of the campaignNow I have seen the article I wanted to know what the Senator fromNorth Carolina was referring to so I went and got factcheckorgFactcheckorg went through the Obama campaign ads and their ads andfact checked what was being said The MCCain adviser is a fellow namedHoltzEakin In a conference call with reporters after the ad wasreleased what he said wasNo service is being reduced Every beneficiary will in thefuture receive exactly the benefits that they have beenpromised from the beginningThat is the same thing as we are doing No benefit is being cut Buthe didnt say he was not going to reduce the overall amount of moneyWhat he said subsequently and I am quoting from factcheckorghere itis as late as October 17 about 2 weeks before the electionMr HoltzEakin said in a telephone conference call with reporters representingthe campaign for the Republican partyAny shortfall in MCCains health care plan will be coveredwithout cutting benefits by such measures as Medicare fraudand abuse reduction employing a new generation of treatmentmodels for expensive chronic diseases speeding adoption oflowcost generic drugs and expanding the use of informationtechnology in medicineThat is exactly some of which is happening right heresome of whichis happening right hereLets get this conversation into a place of reality Here is whathappened in arriving at the reductions in overall Medicareexpenditures which does not reduce any benefit to any seniorcitizen which is why AARP that represents 40 million senior citizensis supporting the Democratic legislation They have written that to usas late as yesterdayMadam President 120 billion comes from reducing overpayments inMedicare Someone on the other side of the aisle has to explain to mehow you hurt Medicare by stopping the charging of a 90 overprice ofpremium to seniors which is what happens Do you know how theoverpayments are paid for Every senior couple in a traditionalMedicare plan pays an additional 90 per year in order to finance theoverpayments What they are suggesting is we shouldnt cutoverpayments What they are suggesting is Medicare is OK payingseniors in a certain group an overpayment that doesnt even go to theseniors Guess whom it goes to It goes to the insurance company Areyou telling me we ought to go to the taxpayers and say Hey folks weknow we are paying a 14percent overpayment for the service compared towhat we pay for everybody else and we are going to keep on paying itThat is exactly what our friends on the other side of the aisle aresayingWhat we are saying is No we think we ought to reduce that paymentand that is the 120 billion That doesnt cut one benefit for asenior but it makes the program more effectiveLet me go further Here are the people who have come together in aseries of meetings to say Yes we can live with a reduction in ouroverall Medicare payment because we can be more efficient Thehospitals came to the White House and said We are willing to reducethe payments we are receiving by 150 billion Guess what We are noteven doing that We are only asking them to reduce their payments by106 billion That is what is in this bill The hospitals have agreedI represent hospitals in Massachusetts We have one of the besthospital systems in America in the network of hospitals we have Peoplecome from all over theworld to come to our hospitals I see the Senator from Minnesota Theycome from all over the world to go to some of the hospitals Minnesotahas The fact is those hospitals agree we can do this moreefficiently and we can reduce the overall payments under Medicare Wehave worked very hard to protect the way we do that so it doesnt doinjuryThe insurers have come to the table Home health care came to thetable I read the letter earlier from home health care services It isfrom the President of the National Association for Home Care  HospiceHe writes We support the provisions of your health care reformlegislation as they relate to home health care That is what we aredebating on the floor They do support itThe fact is the Senator from Georgia who stood and said In ourState we have a letter that sayswell first of all that is based onan earlier assumption Secondly we have no idea what the assumptionsare in the analysis they made Thirdly it is based primarily on theHouse bill which has 13 billion more in reductions than we have Sobefore we get stuck there we ought to listen to the nationalassociation that is working with us on a daily basis where we agree onwhat the reductions ought to beThe skilled nursing facilities the rehab facilities the longtermacute care hospitals have all come to the table and said We can dothis Is that their preference Do they love it Nobody wants theirbudget to be tightened where they have to make changes to try to bemore effective But the bottom line is every single one of them hasagreed with what we are doing on this side of the aisleNotwithstanding that our friends on the other side of the aisle keepcoming back and keep trying to stand for grandma or stand for somesenior citizen who is being falsely scared into believing their benefitis going to be cut or that Medicare is somehow going to be lessavailable to themMy amendment which we will ultimately vote on will guarantee thatno benefit is going to be cut for any senior under this plan That iswhat we are going to doIn addition to that let me remind my colleagues and people listeningwhat this bill does This bill actually improves the solvency ofMedicare We have heard any number of people say Medicare is going togo bankrupt by 2017 Indeed it is We stretch that out We improvethat so we can then take the improvements in the health care systemIt improves the solvency of the Medicare program by 5 years It puts30 billion back into the pockets of seniors in the form of lowerMedicare premiums It makes prescription drugs more affordable Itguarantees that seniors can continue to see the doctor of their choiceIt provides free wellness and prevention benefits to Medicarebeneficiaries They are busy talking about the cuts when this actuallyimproves what Medicare beneficiaries are going to get They dont havewellness and prevention benefits today It provides for themIt guarantees they will see the doctor of their choice It actuallyputs 30 billion back into their pockets and it also includes fair andappropriate changes for home health that actually protects access tohealth careThe truth is the Johanns amendment is the amendment that actuallywould wind up hurting seniors This amendment provides additionalbenefits We all understand the importance of this The Senate billreleases home health care payments so those payments actually reflectthe real cost of providing care We do that not in a partisan way Wedo that based on the nonpartisan MedPAC commission recommendations tous of how you can improve MedicareOur colleagues have a long way to go on the other side to begin totalk about real health care change This bill roots out fraud from thesystem revises how Medicare pays for the outlier cases that is thecases that treat the sicker or what we call outlier patientsUnfortunately GAO found some providers were gaming the system andgetting more outlier payments than they deserve Do they want us tocontinue to overpay people providing service that people either dontneed or charging more for the service that they do need but could havegotten at a lower price Those are the changes we make The Americanpeople will be proud of itLet me give an example The GAO found that in a Florida countyproviders were receiving 60 percent of all the other outlier paymentseven though the county had less than 1 percent of the total Medicarepopulation That is absurd What we do is fix those kinds ofabsurdities that make Americans so angry about the administration oftheir tax dollars in WashingtonI believe the Senate bill addresses a number of these problems in athoughtful wayWe need to have a debate about what is in this bill and what the realimpacts are and what the negative impacts are of not doing thesethings Our colleagues stand for the status quo This is going to behistoric when we pass it because it is going to benefit people in somany different ways getting rid of preexisting condition restraintsnot having people kicked off insurance they thought they had but whenthey get sick they find it is gone We end that We get 31 billionmore people covered in a way that spreads the risk of being sick in asensible way and reduces the costs for other Americans That is commonsense I am proud of what we are doing  President just one moment  President I just was notifiedI wish to respond to afew of the things here The Senator from Arkansas has the pendingamendment My amendment is apparently not quite ready to be called upWhat I want to do if I can make a couple comments so the conversationdoesnt stay where it is prior to the Senator from Arkansas and then Iwill yield and then I would like to be able to come back after thatwith my amendmentI wish to say to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle Ihave listened carefully obviously for a number of days now I noticemost of them have indeed disappearedas the Senator from Montanasuggested It is pretty hard to have a legitimate debate in the Senatewhen people speak and then leave the floor and we cant actually testthe things that have been saidOne of the things that was said a moment ago by the Senator from Utahwas you cannot find any doctors who support this plan Can you finddoctors who oppose it Absolutely I will give him that But dont cometo the floor of the Senate and suggest there are not huge numbers ofdoctors across the country who are desperately waiting for the Senateto pass health care reform and in fact this plan In fact the AMAthis is what the AMA says They represent tens of thousands of doctorsacross the country and they saidWe are working to put the scare tactics to bed once andfor all and inform patients about the benefits of healthreformWe have heard an incredible amount of scare tactics Senator afterSenator standing there jumping up pounding out one sort ofmisstatement or one distortion or another The bottom line is theyhave stood there for the last hour or so claiming they are standingthere to protect seniors It is ironic when one Senator the Senatorfrom Arizona who said yesterday and sort of repeated it todaythis iswhat he said yesterdayI will eagerly look forward to hearing from the authors ofthis legislation as to how they can possibly add 12trillion in cuts without impacting existing Medicare programsnegatively and eventually lead to rationing of health care  That is the Senator from Arizona todayOnly a year ago when he was running for President of the UnitedStates this is what the Senator proposedJohn MCCain would pay for his health plan with majorreductions to Medicare and Medicaid a top aid said in amove that independent analysts estimate could result in cutsof 113 trillion in 10 years to the government programsConsistency obviously has never constrained anybody in politics Weknow that But to stand there over the last half hour or 45 minutesand say Seniors are going to get hurt and seniors dont support thisand we are here to protect seniorsjust a few days ago theorganization that represents 40 million seniors in America it is thelargest single representative group of seniors in our countrywe allknow it it is called AARP It is the American Association of RetiredPersons It represents people from 50 years old on up There are atotal of about 90 million of those in the United States of America sothey represent about half the seniors in AmericaTheir interest day to day is making sure those seniors interestsare not hurt by what we do here in Washington Here is what they saidon November 20Opponents of health reform wont rest They are usingmyths and misinformation to distort the truth and wronglysuggest that Medicare will be harmed After a lifetime ofhard work dont seniors deserve betterThis is what AARP said a few days before that on November 18The new Senate bill makes improvements to the Medicareprogram by creating a new annual wellness benefit providingfree preventive benefits andmost notably for AARP membersreducing drug costs for seniors who fall into the dreadedMedicare doughnut hole a costly gap in prescriptioncoverageThe Federation of American Hospitals said the followingHospitals always will stand by senior citizensThey have no intention of pulling out the support that exists todayThe American Medical AssociationWe are working to put the scare tactics to bed once andfor all and inform patients about the benefits of healthreformThe Catholic Health Association of the United StatesThe possibility that hospitals might pull out of Medicareis very very unfounded Catholic hospitals would nevergive up on Medicare patientsSo everything we have just heard continues the scare tactics tryingto gin anger in America that is unfounded based on the basics of thisbill Let me call attentionthis is the report this year in March thatcame out from Medicareit is about Medicare payment policy It is areport to us the Congress by MedPAC As we all know MedPAC is theentity that oversees the administration of Medicare and its concern ismaintaining the viability of Medicare making sure Medicare patientsare not hurt by a particular programWhat is in this billthat Senator Baucus and those of us on theFinance committee put in the billis precisely what MedPAC told us weshould do and could do without harming seniors Let me sharespecifically what they said we should doThe recommendation is that Congress should eliminate themarket basket increase for 2010 and advance the plannedreductions for coding adjustments in 2011 to 2010 so thatpayments in 2010 are reduced by 55 percent to 1990 levelsThey suggested that They did it because they know it will make theprogram sounder and it will allow them to make payments in other areasof Medicare that wind up taking care of Medicare beneficiaries moreeffectively They saidThe Congress should direct the Secretary of health andhuman services to rebase rates for home health care servicesto reflect the average cost of providing careThat is precisely what we do here But the other side jumps up andthey will take any change anything that reflects a shift from oneplace to anotherthey will exploit shamelessly in an effort to scareseniors and pretend it is somehow going to affect themWhat is interestingand America ought to take note of thistheykeep coming to the floor and they keep opposing what is here They keepwanting to strip something out They keep wanting to send the bill backso that ends this process altogether But they do not come to the floorof the Senate and show us how we could fix it more effectively and infact serve seniors better rather than just embracing the status quoEveryone in America knows the status quo is unacceptable We cannotafford it Medicare will go bankrupt within the next 10 years and thenwhere are we going to beThis is the time for responsible action and every step we haveoffered offers that kind of responsible action without reducing careI will make one last comment and I will yield to the Senator fromArkansas and then come back and talk about further ways in which thisin fact serves seniors and others more effectively But as they havetalked for the last moments they have been talking about home carecutsI have an amendment that shortly we will talk about that willprohibit any reduction in home care that will guarantee we are clearthat we are prohibiting any reduction in home care But I have longbeen an advocate for better home care more home care capacity In theFinance Committee I offered amendments to sustain that home carequalityNobody worked harder than our late colleague Senator Ted Kennedywith whom I worked for years on this to try to extend home healthcare protect home health care patients and augment home health careHere is what the people who represent home health care in America haveto say This is from the National Association for Home Care  Hospicea letter they sent to Senator Baucus It was a letter they sentyesterdayThe National Association for Home Care  Hospice supportsmaking health care available to all Americans We believethat everyone must be willing to sacrifice to make thishappen The National Association for Home Care  Hospicehas agreed to do its part by reducing costs and payments in amanner that makes the Medicare home care program moreefficient and less susceptible to abuse We are grateful forthe opportunity to make these improvements and at the sametime protect the thousands of ethical providers who areparticipating in this important program We are pleased tohave the opportunity to work with your staff to make thishappen For all these reasons the National Association forHome Care  Hospice supports the provisions of your healthcare reform legislation as they relate to home health careWe look forward to working with you and your staff   Thank you for the important work you are doingWho better to speak to the concerns of home health care The folkswho have continually been distorting this debate and who continue totry to scare people or an association whose sole existence whosepayroll every day is put to the use of protecting the folks theyrepresent in home care I think the answer is selfevident to anybodywho wants to listen to common sense  What I am aware of is that the individual who was runningfor President of the United States never stood up and said it wasfalse I dont have any quote of Senator MCCain ever refuting it All Ican say is that throughout the campaign that was the operativelanguage It was debated It was never refutedI yield the floor  Reserving the right to object  Madam President I am not going to object to puttingsomething important in but I would like my colleague to stay for amoment because this is very important  I have objected to a statement being put in unless I havea chance to explain it  I thank my friend from Arizona because this is the way theSenate ought to work I totally agree with what the Senator said Iwant the Senator to know I agree with him He is correct that thestatement in FactCheckorg calls the Obama campaign to account for amisstatement about his proposal I agree It did that It did notrecommend a reduction in benefits But that is not what I suggestedthat it did What I am talking about is the Senator saidand hisstaff insistedhe could get the savings for his reductions that wouldbenefit Medicare from waste fraud and abuse from new treatmentmodels from expanding the use of information technology and that thereis a complete similarity between what we are doing in order to achievethese savings and what he was doing I am trying to point out thesimilarity not the difference I am not here to debate the campaignad I think it didnt accurately reflect the Senators position But doI believe if you read the whole article which is why I will notobject to it being put in there you will see it clearly says he issupportive of savings in Medicare so you can do it without cuttingbenefits which is exactly what we are doingI yield the floor and thank my colleague for his courtesy

S_IA_GRASSLEY,2009-12-20, President we have all been waiting for many weekswhile the Democratic leadership worked behind closed doors out ofpublic view to write this new health care reform bill and thisprocess of course is very much contrary to what the Presidentpromised during the campaignthat negotiations on the health carereform bill would even be on CSPAN so everybody in the country couldsee it So now a very secretly put together bill is out for ourconsideration with just a few days to consider itLast week they were considering expanding Medicare to people between55 and 64 years of agealso increasing Medicare to cover people up to150 percent of povertyand thirdly having a governmentrun plan runby the Office of Personnel ManagementNow we have something entirely different We have the Reid amendmentand it is chock full of special deals It does nothing to fix the fatalflaws in the 2074page bill we started with and now we have a billthat is probably 400 pages longer than 2074 pagesWhat kind of changes does this new amendment make to the originalReid amendment Well one tax disappearsit was a tax on cosmeticsurgeryand in its place we have a new tax a tax on tanning bedservices The dial on the Medicare payroll tax is turned up So thefirsttime marriage penalty in a Medicare taxone that hits about halfthe twoearner couplesis enhanced Well over 1 million couples get tolook forward to that tax hitcan you believe itjust for beingmarried So the old marriage penalty is back The dial on the insurancefee is also turned up in the back end of the billBut with respect to a few favored insurance companies the fee isturned off The very limited small business tax credit is expandedover 12 trillion in new taxes according to the officialcongressional scorekeepers What kind of tax changes stay the sameBasically the managers amendment in the underlying Reid amendmentstill imposes new taxesnew taxes on everything from tanning beds toinsurance companies to wages to heart valves to drugs and even moreContrary to what has been said on the Senate floor this very day thetax burden still rests on many middleclass folks As has been saidthere is a sizable subsidy that 12 million taxfiling families andindividuals receive We do not dispute that But what the other sidedoes not want to acknowledge is this There are 42 million taxfilingmiddleclass families and individuals who will pay higher taxes underthis 2000plus page bill For every middleclass taxfiling familywho receives an insurance subsidy three middleclass families will payhigher taxesI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of acorrected version of an article from Congressional Daily datedDecember 18 of this yearThere being no objection the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record as followsFrom CongressDaily AM Dec 18 2009Labor Cites JCT Analysis To Argue Against Cadillac TaxBy Peter CohnLabor officials Thursday unveiled new ammunition in theirfight against a proposal to tax highcost health insuranceplans in the Senate health bill citing a congressionalanalysis that found more than 22 million households earningless than 200000 would see a tax increase by 2019That figure could rise a bit as the Joint Committee onTaxation did not distribute information on tax returns formarried couples earning up to 250000 which is thethreshold set by President Obama when he pledged not to taxthe middle class The tax issue could be the most intractabledifference between Senate and Housepassed legislationwhichinstead relies on a millionaires surtaxas Democraticleaders struggle to cobble together a bill that can pass inboth chambers next year Communications Workers of AmericaPresident Larry Cohen whose group released the JCT figuressaid they demonstrate irrefutably that the excise taxwhich will result in reduced coverage and increased costs forour middle class familiesis the opposite of reformMost House Democrats and union officials are adamant thatthe final version does not break Obamas pledge and tax thosehouseholds earning less than 250000 Obama at one pointappeared to endorse the House bills surtax which is thesinglebiggest revenue source in either bill at 4605billion There are major problems with that tax in theSenate however not least because it is not indexed forinflation It also could affect about onethird of all incomeearned by small business owners that file individual taxreturns according to JCTThis is going to be a major problem no question aboutit said a senior Democratic aide The White House isgoing to have to weigh in and provide some directionThere have been some mixed signals The president in a Julypress conference said the House surtax meets my principleof not burdening families who are already having a toughtime In a speech to Congress after Labor Day howeverObama endorsed the Senate excise tax as a modest changethat could help hold down the cost of health care for all ofus in the long runThe 40 percent excise tax in the Senate bill would affectemployersponsored coverage worth more than 8500 for singleworkers and 23000 for family plans beginning in 2013 Thosefigures would rise with inflation plus 1 percent each yearwith higher beginning thresholds for older workers and thosein highrisk professions Certain highcost states would begranted additional room before the tax kicks inIn a White House blog post Wednesday National EconomicCouncil Deputy Director Jason Furman said the Senate billwould not hike taxes on the middle class and actually wouldprovide a net tax cutHe noted JCT estimates that only 3 percent of healthpremiums would be affected in 2013 a figure that rises to 8percent by 2019 as well as the higher wages that wouldaccompany a decrease in costly health benefitsOne school of thought holds that whatever bill is able tomuster 60 Senate votes will form the basis for the finallegislation and House Speaker Pelosi will have to deliverthe votes in her chamber Another says 188 House Democratsthat oppose the Senate taxa broad crosssection led bysecondterm Rep Joe Courtney of Connecticut who requestedthe new JCT data and Rep Sander Levin of Michiganwontallow the House to be steamrolledHow did they get into this mess one labor officialasked Theyve set this thing up terribly and they have ahuge problem in their CaucusThe senior Democratic aide said another Senate provisionan increase in the Medicare payroll tax for those earningabove the 200000 and 250000 thresholds could meet theHouse test Another idea promoted by Sen Debbie StabenowDMich would apply the Medicare tax to unearned income suchas capital gains and dividends and also has some cache in theHouseBut those proposals also have the disadvantage of beingprime revenue sources tohelp shore up Medicares finances over the long haul whichcould be negated if used up to help expand healthcarebenefits to younger workersHouse moderates at one point considered a plan authored bythe centrist Democratic think tank Third Way to tax excessmedical inflation or healthcare premiums that are risingmuch faster than overall economic growth Sen Thomas CarperDDel an honorary Third Way cochairman has pitched theidea in his chamber as well He continues to argue it couldbe a fallback position other sources on and off Capitol Hillsuggested the train has already left the station and it wastoo late to inject a new and untested idea into the mixWhat is striking is the amount of agreement between unionsand Republicans on the Senates excise tax howeverRepublicans including Sen John MCCain RAriz have longheld that taxing employerprovided health coverage is thebest way to keep costs down and raise revenues But inopposing the overall health bill they have latched on to thefact that the excise tax and other taxes in the bill wouldhit those middleclass workers Obama wants to protectAccording to JCT data analyzed by Senate Finance CommitteeRepublicans the number of households earning less than200000 that would be hit with a tax increase number closerto 42 million in 2019 or about 25 percent of all tax filersunder that thresholdThey looked not only at the excise tax but also a scaledback itemized deduction for medical expenses for those withcosts not covered by insurance and those affected by theMedicare tax that have losses bringing their income under thethresholdsThe numbers factor in those who receive premium tax creditsand subsidies to offset the cost of buying health coverage inthe bill Most of those hit with net tax increases earnbetween 50000 and 200000 annually Of those householdsearning under 75000 roughly 12 million would come outahead JCT found including many who earn too little to paytaxes This new compromise does not fix any of the coreproblems in this original 2074page Reid bill It is still that longof a bill It is still a 25 trillion massive bill as far as costs areconcerned The Reid amendment actually adds 400 more pagesThese closeddoor negotiations did not produce a better productQuite the opposite It still taxes middleclass families seniors andveterans Millions of people still will not be able to keep what theyhave as the President promised in the last campaign A lot of peoplewho were hoping to pay less as a result of the word reform willstill end up paying moreI am not just talking about the young and the healthy It stillimposes higher premiums for prescription drug coverage on seniors andthe disabled It still permanently cuts all annual Medicare providerpayment updates based on productivity gains outside of health careThese cuts still go into effect even if it means providers will get anegative payment update and these permanent cuts still threatenMedicare access to careThe bill still cuts 120 billion from Medicare Advantage cuts thatwill reduce Medicare benefits for 11 million beneficiaries contrary towhat the President told us in his speech in Septemberthat nobody isgoing to get cut in Medicare This bill still creates a new body ofunelected officials with broad authority to make further cuts inMedicare beyond the 40some billion that are in this billThis bill still unwisely makes the board permanent This bill stillrequires this board to continue making even more cuts in Medicare andto do that forever into the futureThe damage this group of unelected people could do to Medicare isunknown but we certainly do know how impossible it will be to undo anydamage that unelected board does if Congress decides we ought to undoit That is because whatever cuts they make we have to offset andstirring up that money is very difficult for offsetsThis bill passes a 26 billion unfunded mandate on to the Statesbecause the Reid amendment even made this problem worse by adding 1billion to that unfunded mandate for States under Medicaid Theseincreased costs will cause States to raise taxes maybe cut educationmaybe cut transportation and maybe cut law enforcement But it isstill money the States have to dig upThis bill still has the CLASS Act in it even though theadministrations own Health and Human Services Chief Actuary says itruns the riska great riskof being unsustainableIt still has a special carveout for committee and leadership stafffrom having to use the health insurance exchanges This is a cute moveon the part of somebody in these closeddoor offices I got anamendment through the Senate Finance Committee on a unanimous basisthat if the people of this country have to use the exchange employeesand Congressmen on Capitol Hill ought to use it But no when you getto the secrecy behind doors just the Congressmen and their permanentstaffs but not the thousands of people who serve on leadership staff orcommittee staff they still got the deal they have today So they arenot going to know what the American people are going through by usingthe exchangeThis bill still has special deals for brandname drug makers thatwill reduce access to generic drugs making drug costs even higher foreveryone What this process has shown is that there is a clear andsignificant philosophical difference between this side of the aisleversus that side of the aisle Those differences are still there andthe lines between us on this specific piece of legislation becomebrighter still even though maybe on 90 percent of the legislationgoing before this body there is bipartisan cooperation But on thisone restructuring onesixth of the economy health care being a lifeordeath issue for 306 million Americans this is different fromanything this body has tried before On something such as this maybethere is a legitimate reason for having differencesRepublicans tried to reduce the overall cost They said no Theyincreased the spending in the bill Republicans tried to reduce thepervasive role of government They said no and they increased the roleof government Republicans tried to make it harder for illegalimmigrants to get benefits They said no and that still has not beenfixed Republicans tried to guarantee that Federal funding forabortions would not be allowed under this bill That has been theFederal policy since 1976 That has even had bipartisan support eversince the Hyde amendment was put in place that year But they said noThey wouldnt agree to apply that policy That still has not beenfixed Republicans tried to allow alternatives to the individualmandate and the harsh penalties associated with it They said no Theyhave subjected even more people to the mandate and they have raisedpenalties Republicans tried to raise medical malpractice reform Theysaid no Real lawsuit reform is still not in this billWe have watched while the other side has expanded governmentcoverage Since this process began the other side has been workinghard to move millions of people from private coverage to governmentsubsidized coverage The bill creates new government programs thatcover families making close to 100000 a year When we hear about thatin rural America in the Midwest part of the United States they thinkwe have gone bananas in this body by subsidizing families making100000At the end of the day after raising billions in new taxes cuttingabout 12 trillion from Medicare imposing stiff new penalties forpeople who dont buy insurance and increasing costs for those who dostill 23 million people will not have health insurance I dont thinkthis is what the American people had in mind when we promised to fixhealth careThe Reid bill imposes a 25 trillion tab on Americans It kills jobswith taxes and fees that go into effect 4 years before the benefits ofthe bill take hold It kills jobs with that employer mandate Itimposes 12 trillion in higher taxes on premiums on medicaldevices on prescription drugs and yet more It jeopardizes access tocare with massive Medicare cuts It imposes higher costs It raisespremiums It bends the cost curve in the wrong way because people wouldexpect you to bend inflation down but this bill takes it up This isnot what people have in mind when they think about health care reformWe have been hearing repeatedly from the majority whip from Illinoisthat the Republican side has offered only four amendments I found thisto be rather astonishing The majority whip should know because theyare filed at the desk that Republicans have put forth 214 amendmentsIn addition to striking some of the bad ideas in the Reid bill theseamendments also contain Republican proposals that areimprovements over the Reid bill But in this rush to get it done themajority has decided they dont want to consider any more of the 440amendments filed at the deskLets be clear We keep them so people can have access to themanytime they want to the 440 amendments that have been filed that weare accused of not offering any suggestions or improvements Right herein these three binders any one of the amendments you want it isthereSince this happens to be the case I would like to take them up ontheir interest in considering additional amendments The majorityleader and my friend the Senator from Montana have both said theywant this bill to fill the doughnut hole in the Medicare Part DProgram I share my colleagues desire to provide even more protectionthan seniors get under Medicare I filed an amendment that is in thisbinder amendment No 3182 that would use the savings from medicalliability reform which happens to be about the second or third thingthat always comes up at my town meetings that the people in thiscountry feel we ought to be working on if we are going to make real theword reform It would put that 50 billion into savings towardeliminating the doughnut hole The amendment puts the needs of 27million seniors ahead of the needs of trial lawyers I cant speak formy colleagues but that seems like a pretty easy decisionTo my good friend from Montana I only have one unanimous consentrequest I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment inorder to offer amendment No 3182 which is at the desk  I find it disappointing that we would miss theopportunity to forgo 50 billion in savings that could makeprescription drugs more affordable for 27 million seniors Even thoughmy friend has just said they are filling the doughnut hole I wouldquickly say it is being filled in a way that the big pharmaceuticalcompanies are going to make sure they are selling prescription drugsprescribed drugs for a long period of time and not have the savingsthat ought to come from using generics to a greater extent This 50billionactually 54 billionthat CBO says we would save with medicalmalpractice reform would be a better way of filling that doughnut holeI have a parliamentary inquiry of the Chair I want to make a parliamentary inquiry about thepending managers amendment My inquiry will be whether the pendingamendment which everyone agrees is critical to the health care reformlegislation before us complies with Senate rule XLIVSenate rule XLIV was adopted as part of major ethics and governmentreform legislation It was passed in 2007 Its title was the HonestLeadership and Open Government Act The Democratic leadership made itthe first bill introduced when they took over the majority in 2007 Itenjoyed broad bipartisan support I wish the reform had been tougherThe part of the legislation that became Senate rule XLIV dealt with thetransparency of earmarks They are technically defined as limited taxbenefits and congressionally directed spending itemsRule XLIV applies to floor amendments such as the pending managersamendment Rule XLIV requires the sponsor of the amendmentin thiscase Senator Reidto provide a list of these narrow provisionsSenator Reid has not provided the list We received the severalhundredpage amendment yesterday morning Republican staff haveperformed a preliminary review That review finds that some itemsmightI repeat mightbe limited tax benefits There are pressreports about narrowly crafted exceptions to the insurance feeI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of theDow Jones article dated December 19 2009There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record as followsFrom Dow Jones NewswiresSenator Nelson Wins Tax CarveOut for Mutual of Omaha in Health BillBy Martin VaughanWashington Dow JonesInsurance giant Mutual of Omahawill see less of a hit from a 10 billionayear industrywide tax on health insurance providers under the terms of adeal worked out between Senate Democratic leaders and SenBen Nelson D NebUnder revised Senate health legislation unveiled Saturdayby Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid D Nev the tax oninsurers will begin in 2011 at 2 billion a year eventuallyrising to 10 billion annually The tax is to be divided upbased on each companys market shareSenate aides who reviewed the legislation said provisionsin the revised bill are specifically crafted to protectNebraska insurers including Mutual of OmahaThe tax carveout appears to be one of several concessionsNelson won from Democratic leaders before agreeing to add hisvote the final one needed to secure passage in the Senateto the healthcare measureThe biggest issue for us was abortion said JakeThompson a Nelson spokesman But Sen Nelson also wantedto ensure that Nebraskans wont face increased premiums as aresult of a fee that was going to be imposedNelson inserted a provision that will carve outsupplemental Medicare insurance from that tax That provisionwill benefit Mutual of Omaha but also other insurers thatoffer socalled Medigap policies Thompson saidNelson also won support for a provision ensuring thatNebraska wont have to foot any costs for new Medicaidenrollees That is important because the Senate bill expandsMedicaid eligibility potentially increasing costs for manystates under a costsharing system with the federalgovernmentMost other states will be required to pick up between 5and 18 of coverage costs for new Medicaid enrollees withthe federal government picking up the remainderThe revised bill introduced by Reid also carves out nonprofit insurers that meet certain criteria especially inNebraska and Michigan from the new industrywide taxSeveral states had unique circumstances and Reidthought it was appropriate to provide a narrow exemption fromthe fee for a couple of states that had uniquecircumstances a Senate Democratic aide said in aconference call with reportersNebraska also had circumstances that necessitated therelief the aide said without elaboratingThis legislation is good for our country and good forNebraska Nelson said in announcing his support for thehealthcare bill SaturdayOne provision in the bill is narrowly tailored to apply toBlue CrossBlue Shield of Nebraska Nelsons spokesman saidIt says that a company that is a mutual insurance company andhad a market share in a state of between 40 and 60 in 2008would be exempt from the taxSenate transparency rules enacted after Democrats took overthe chamber in 2006 discourage narrowly crafted tax breaksalso called tax earmarks Senators are required when offeringamendments that include such provisions to publish a list inthe Congressional Record and the amendments could be subjectto procedural objectionsThe Senate GOP aide said that carving one insuranceprovider out of the tax could put it at a distinct advantagewith respect to competitors The Joint Tax Committee hasestimated that the tax could result in increased premiums toconsumers of between 1 and 15If one company is protected from that fee youre talkingabout a significant pricing differential the aide said Likewise single State Medicaid provisions might bedetermined to be congressionally directed spending items Under ruleXLIV the determinations are not made by the minority staffIn order to ensure transparency of narrow provisions the burden ison the sponsor to provide the listThis is my parliamentary inquiry Does rule XLIV of the StandingRules of the Senate require that if a Senator proposes an amendmentcontaining congressionally directed spending or a limited tax benefitthat the sponsor of those provisions and the names of the Senatorsrequesting them be printed in the Record Has the majority leader provided a list of thesespecialdeals and of the Members requesting them for the Record as required bythe Senate rules So what is the situation as far as the rule beingprovided as long as the Senate has not been made aware of this

S_IA_GRASSLEY,2009-12-10, President I come to the floor at this point togive some breadth to a statement that was made on the floor earliertoday It was made by my friend Senator Baucus I dont take offenseto what he said because I sensed a great deal of frustration in hisstatement I will read what he said so you know what I am reacting toThe reason I dont take offense to what he said is because he and Ihave worked so closely together over 10 years with one or the other ofus being chairman of the Finance Committee that we have such anunderstanding of each otherJust prior to the remarks I am going to read he had spokenpositively about Senator Enzi and me So I want my colleagues to knowthis statement is not made out of anger that I am going to give arebuttal toWell we kept working bipartisanworking together fordays and days hours and hours and then fortunately MrPresident it got to the point where Im just calling it as Isee it I cantIone of my feelings is Im too honestabout things And itsthe Republicans started to walk awayThey pulled away from the table They had to leaveI ask you why Why did that happen And the answer is tobe totally fair and above board isand above board isbecause their leadership asked them to Their leadershipasked them to become disengaged from the process I know thatto be a fact Why did their leadership ask Republicans toleave and become disengaged from the process To be totallycandid they wanted to score political points by justattacking this bill They were not here to helphelp beconstructive to find bipartisan solutions They were for awhile then when the rubber started to meet the road and itcame time to try to make some decisions they left and beganto attackand began to attackI wish to take a few minutes to respond to these remarks that I readIt was asserted through these remarks on the floor that someRepublicans in the socalled Gang of 6 were directed by the SenateRepublican leadership to cease participating in bipartisan talks TheGang of 6 referred to the six bipartisan members of the Senate FinanceCommittee On the Democratic side the members were my friends threechairmen including Senator Baucus Budget Committee chairman SenatorConrad and Energy Committee chairman Senator Bingaman All are seniormembers of the Democratic Caucus On the Republican side the threemembers included Senator Snowe ranking member of the Small BusinessCommittee Senator Enzi ranking member of the Health EducationLabor and Pensions Committee and this Senator Senators Snowe andEnzi are senior Members of the Republican caucusChairman Baucus convened this working group with a singular goal of abipartisan health care reform bill We met for several weeks up in theMontana Room of Chairman Baucuss office I would agree with the wayparticipating Members have described these discussions They were wellinformed thoughtful provocative challenging and frustrating all atthe same time But I would say that in the months we negotiated therewas never once that anyone walked away from the table There was neveronce that there were any harsh wordsWhile we were engaged in those discussions there was constantpressure from folks outside the room for us to reach a quick deal Thatpressure came from the White House it came from the Democraticleadership it came from advocacy groups outside and it came from manymedia folks covering the daybyday meetings To be fair the SenateRepublican leadership was very concerned about some of the directionsthe policy discussions were taking in the Gang of 6 That concern grewparticularly after the very partisan HELP Committee markup occurredSenator Hatch left the original Gang of 7 because of the character andresult of the HELP Committee markupMost important the Senate Republican leadership was concerned that abipartisan Finance Committee bill would be coopted into a partisanfloor bill when the Democratic leadership merged the bills SenatorsSnowe Enzi and I anticipated that concernTo be fair to Senator Baucus as he was negotiating with us he triedto convince us that we would be very much a part of those merging ofthe bills He offered that in good faith I believe him I even believehim today saying that But seeing how neither the HELP Committee northe Finance Committee was as involved as they should have been in whatSenator Reidput together in this 2074page bill I wonder whether Senator Baucuscould have if we had a bipartisan agreement actually carried out thatguaranteeFrom the getgo we Republican members of the Gang of 6 to make surewe were a part of the process that I described as Senator Baucus toldus we would be asked for assurances from the White House and from theSenate Democratic leadership on the next step in the legislativeprocess if we in fact did arrive at a bipartisan agreementI also found that many in the broader group of Republicans whoprovided the bipartisan glue for the CHIP bill of 2008 had similarconcerns All Republicans had process concerns such as where would itgo once it left the Senate Finance CommitteeWe wanted assurances and here is what we wanted The assurancesrequested boiled down to a goodfaith promise that the bipartisanFinance Committee health care bill would not morph into a partisanhealth care reform bill when Majority Leader Reid merged the twocommittee bills We wanted to make sure the bipartisan character of abipartisan Finance Committee bill was going to be retained throughthese next steps To do otherwise would be akin to getting on a bus andnot knowing where the bus was going or how much the bus ticket wouldcost Assurances were also requested with respect to a conferencebetween the House and Senate The assurances were similar to assurancesrequested by Senator Reid and made by the thenmajority Republicanleadership during the period of 2005 and 2006 The Democratic minorityleader at that time made these assurances a condition to lettingmajor regular order Finance Committee bills even go to conferenceAs an example take a look at the Congressional Record and you willsee the assurances made by thenMajority Leader Frist to thenMinorityLeader Reid These requests were made repeatedly to the Democraticleadership publicly and privately about how the postcommittee actionof the bipartisan group would be handled in the merger with the HELPCommittee bill It was a focus of a July 8 lunchtime facetofacemeeting at the majority leaders office with Senators Reid BaucusConrad Bingaman Snowe Enzi and myself The bottomline responsefrom Senator Reid at that meeting was he needed 60 votesI guess the implication was despite the fact that the Democraticcaucus contained 60 members then and now Senator Reid didnt think itwas possible to secure the votes of all members of his caucus Arestatement of the reality of the Senate rules was not the assurancesthe three Republican Senatorsthis one includedsought from SenatorReidSenator Reid himself recognized the validity of this request in anAugust 8 Washington Post article I ask unanimous consent to have thatarticle printed in the RecordThere being no objection the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record as

wouldreally not eventually lead to a government takeover MCCainsaid on CNNs State of the UnionPelosi and other Democrats have countered that Republicansare seeking to protect a health insurance industry that istheir business ally not so much from a government insuranceoption but from the broad industry reforms that enjoy publicsupport including the elimination of coverage caps and thepractice of denying coverage to those with preexistingconditions The White House also wants to steer the debatetoward insurance reform as it is easier to digest thanlongterm cost control which is another chief objectiveHow you regulate the insurance industry is as importantto healthcare reform as controlling costs said WhiteHouse Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel The public plan he saidis one of an array of measures intended to change industrybehaviorAs the rhetoric against the industry heated up the leadinginsurance trade group issued a statement Thursday calling forlawmakers to cool down their

changesthat Congress is seeking including those involving preexisting conditions and ratings based on health status andgenderDespite the sparring House and Senate Democrats and threeGOP Senate negotiators have reached broad consensus on theoutlines of reform Lawmakers generally agree thatindividuals must be required to buy health insurance thatMedicaid should be significantly expanded and that taxincreases in some form will be required The final billalso could bring about some of the most significant changesto Medicare since the program was created in 1965But the rebellion from fiscal conservatives on the Energyand Commerce Committee last week served as a political wakeup call for Democratic leaders With enough votes on thepanel and on the floor to sink reform legislation the BlueDog Coalition forced Pelosi and Emanuel into concessions thatmade the government plan similar to private health insurancesparking a new fight with House liberalsSensing that the Blue Dogs had dug in for a prolongedfight Pelosi and Emanuel gave in to most demands in order toget the legislation moving again They essentially decidedthat it was better to pick a fight with their liberal flankwhere Pelosi remains popular and where loyalty to Obama isstrongest particularly in the Congressional Black CaucusDespite threats from almost 60 progressive HouseDemocratswho outnumber the Blue DogsPelosi defended thecompromise saying it was similar to one backed by SenEdward M Kennedy DMass Pelosi predicted that theliberal wing would fall in line because the legislation is soimportant to themAre you

troublesome as the internal House divisions is theburgeoning distrust among House Democrats their Senatecounterparts and the White HousePelosi acknowledged that there are concerns in hercaucus that the White House namely their former colleagueEmanuel takes House Democrats for granted House lawmakersare being encouraged to pass the most liberal bill possibleshe said while the White House works on a bipartisancompromise with a select group of senatorsIts no secret Pelosi said that members sometimesthink Why do I always read in the paper that theyrechecking with the Finance Committee all the time What doesthat mean that they just want to know whats happened withthe Finance Committee What about the Senate healthcommittee What about our committees over here The six Senate Finance Committee negotiators have burrowedin for another six weeks of talks having set a Sept 15deadline for producing a bill The group includes an array ofsmallstate senators with little national prominence who haveproven surprisingly resistant to pressure from their partyleaders and the White HouseAlthough the House bill and the Senate Health Committeeversion have attracted no Republican support the SenateFinance Committee coalition includes Sens Mike Enzi Wyoand Charles Grassley Iowa both Republicans along withmoderate GOP Sen Olympia Snowe Maine And the leadDemocratic negotiator Finance CommitteeChairman Max Baucus Mont is a moderate who has brokenwith his party on numerous bills coauthored with GrassleyThe closer these negotiators move to striking a deal themore fraught the discussions become by issues of trust andpolitical will Among Republicans the pressure is especiallyacute All three GOP senators fear they will be sidelinedonce the bill is approved at the committee level with theirnames invoked to demonstrate bipartisanship even as theyreleft with no say over the final product as it is meshed withthe Senate health panels version and then ultimately withthe House billFor Republicans a prime concern is that Senate MajorityLeader Harry Reid Nev will abandon the Finance Committeebill and force legislation to the Senate floor using budgetrules that would protect against a Republican filibusterEven advocates concede that the option is highly risky andthat it would vastly limit the policy scope of the bill Forinstance Senate budget experts say most insurance reformswould have to be sidelinedTreasury Secretary Timothy F Geithner said Sunday that theadministration would consider all options Ideally youwant to do this with as broad a base of consensus aspossible he said in an interview on ABCs This WeekBut people on the Hill are going to have to make thatchoice Do they want to help shape this and be part of it ordo they want this country the United States of America togo another several decades without reformReid said he already provided the Republicans with someassurances and added Ill do more if necessary He saidof GOP concerns I dont blame them And he added thatconsidering the political realities of the Senate with itslarge number of moderate Democrats healthcare reform wouldhave to gain significant bipartisan support to cross thefinish lineI sure hope we can get a bipartisan bill it makes iteasier for me to go home moderate Sen Mary Landrieu DLa told the Democratic caucus last week according to ReidWe all feel that way Reid added President I will quote in part from the articleThe closer these negotiators move to striking a deal themore fraught the discussions become by issues of trust andpolitical will Among Republicans the pressure is especiallyacute All three GOP senators fear they will be sidelinedonce the bill is approved at the committee level with theirnames invoked to demonstrate bipartisanship even as theyreleft with no say over the final product as it is meshed withthe Senate health panels version and then ultimately withthe House billRepublicans were also worried that the bipartisan product could belifted into a partisan reconciliation bill I quote further from thatsame Post articleReid said he already provided the Republicans with someassurances and added Ill do more if necessaryContinuing to quote from the Post articleHe said of GOP concerns I dont blame them And headded that considering the political realities of theSenate with its large number of moderate Democrats healthcare reform would have to gain significant bipartisan supportto cross the finish linePresident Obama and the Senate Democratic leadership set a deadlineof September 15 for the bipartisan Gang of 6 to produce a proposal Ifthe proposal were not available by then the President and SenateDemocratic leadership made it clear the plug would be pulled on furtherbipartisan talksI point that out because that is very significant A powerful memberof the Senate Democratic leadership the senior Senator from New Yorkmade it crystal clear the Senate Democratic leadership would pull theplug That member who is very smart and articulate made it astransparent as possible that the September 15 deadline was moreimportant than a bipartisan dealI ask you to go back and look at the media reports The Gang of 6 wasunable to reach a deal on contentious issues such as abortion theindividual mandate and financing issues by White HouseDemocraticleaderships deadlineChairman Baucus had to move forward I respect the pressure my friendfrom Montana was under I have been there myself But the record needsto be correctly made that the September 15 deadline was not aRepublican deadline It was a deadline imposed by the White House andthe Senate Democratic leadership I might say that wasnt just the GOPdeadlineit wasnt a deadline for the Gang of 6 either I didntsense from the three Democratic members that they agreed with thatSo the Senate Democratic leadership pulled the plug on the talksAgain go check the public comments and press reports They pulled theplug Senator Enzi and I could not agree to the product at that pointbecause of substantive issues that were resolved against us and thefailure of the White House or Senate Democratic leadership to deliveron those process assurances that we asked forSenator Snowe did have substantive issues resolved sufficiently atthe Finance Committee markup so that she could support the billI might note today that I heard Senator Snowe caution the Democratsas she gave them the boost from her vote in the Finance Committeethatwas right after the bill passedshe made it clear that her vote forlater stages would depend in part on data on the key question ofwhether the product makes health care more affordable Her letter toCBO dated December 3 lays out the issues in precisionAt the next stage of the process the mergedbill stage all of theSenate Republicans worst fears were confirmed but it was especiallytelling to Senator Enzi and me My sense is Senator Snowe appreciatedit more than any other member of our conference The bottom line wasthat the majority leaders merged bill was constructed in such apartisan way that Senator Snowes input was cast asideLets be clear Senate Republicans did not set deadlines SenateRepublicans did not threaten to go their own way if the deadlines werenot met Even today the pending motion from this side of the aisleputs the question to the Senate this way Take the bill back to theFinance CommitteeAs the old saying goes hindsight is 2020 As I look back on theprocess I make these observations There was an uncanny disconnectbetween those inside and outside the room Many on the outside mainlyfrom the left side of the political spectrum seemed to want a reformdeal just to have a deal They did not seem to be that curious aboutthe contents Perhaps for some of those folks it was a bit of animperative to draw on the good will that any President has in the firstfew months of officeFor those of us in the roommeaning the room where the negotiationswere going onthere was a realization that we were tackling asChairman Baucus has described it an extremely complex set of issuesWe learned very quickly that closing the loop on the policy issues letalone finding political consensus was not easyThe pressure to close a deal by the July 4 recess was overwhelmingMy friend the chairman wisely pushed back and said we would get adeal when we reached a bipartisan deal The Group of 6 was unable toreach a deal on contentious issues such as abortion individualmandate and financing issues faced by the White HouseDemocraticleadership deadline Chairman Baucus had to move In my heart I feelhe would rather not have had that sort of pressure or make thatdecision But that was not our deadline It was a deadline imposed bythe White House and the Senate Democratic leadership They pulled theplug on the talks Go check the public comments and the press reportsThey pulled the plug Senator Enzi and I could not agree to a productat that point because of the substantive issues that were very muchinvolvedI want to make it very clear for this Senator of the threeRepublicans who were negotiating kind of in summary that theRepublican leadership I think had questions about a lot of thingsthat were going on in those negotiations But never once did SenatorMCConnell my leader say to me Get out of thereThat is the impression that was left this morningI can only say that I think I have established a reputation in theSenate particularly while I was chairman of the Senate FinanceCommittee that I did not listen to either the White House or people inleadership necessarily when I thought a bipartisan compromise was theonly way to get things done I suppose there is a whole long list ofthings that I ought to write down before I make this statement but Ican only think of two or three right now that I can be sure of that Ican say in an intellectually honest way that I stood up to the BushWhite House when I was chairman of the committeeThey came out immediately for a 17 trillion tax cut in 2001 I madea decision early on that it was not good for the economy and it was notpolitically possible So we passed a much smaller in a bipartisan waytax bill for that year And yet it was the biggest tax cut in thehistory of the countryIn 2003 when the White House and House Republicans in the majorityat that time said we had to have a 700 billion tax cut in addition tothe tax cut that was passed in 2001 there were not votes in the Senateamong just Republicans to get it done To secure the votes to get itdone we had to limit it to half that amount of money or just a littlebit more than half that amount of money And in order to get thosevotes contrary to the 700 billion tax cut that the Bush White Housewanted and the House Republicans wanted that we could not get throughhere I said I will not come out of conference with a tax cut more thanthat amount of roughly 300 billionWe got that done by just the bare majority to get it done But Istood up to the White House I stood up to the House Republicanleadership who thought we should not be doing anything that was shortof that full 700 billionThere have been other health care bills very recently where I stoodup against the White House and against our Republican leadershipI think I have developed a reputation where I am going to do what isright for the State of Iowa and for our country And I am going to tryto represent a Republican point of view as best I can consideringfirst the country and my own constituencyThen when it comes to whether people in this body or outside of thisbody might think that for the whole months of May June and July andthrough August with a couple meetings we had during the month ofAugust that we were dragging our feet to kill a health care reformbill I want to ask people if they would think I wouldnt have betterthings to do with my time than to have 24 different meetings one onone with Chairman Baucus or that I wouldnt have more than somethingelse to do than have 31 meetings with the Group of 6 These were notjust short meetings These were meetings that lasted hours There wasanother group of peopleGrassley Baucus and others sometimes thatincluded people from the HELP Committee and the Budget Committee Butwe had 25 meetings like that I wonder if people think we would just bemeeting and spending all those hours to make sure that nothing happenedaround here No Every one of the 100 Senators in this body if youwere to ask them would suggest changes in health care that need to bemade Even in that 2074page bill there are some things that mostconservative people in this country would think ought to be doneWe all know to some extent something has to be done about thissystem We worked for a long period of time thinking we could havesomething bipartisan But it did not work out that way and now we areat a point where we have a partisan billThat is not the way you should handle an issue such as health carereform Just think of the word health health care It dealswith the life and death of 306 million Americans Just think you arerestructuring onesixth of the economySenator Baucus and I started out in January and February saying toeverybody we met every group we talked to that something thismomentous ought to be passing with 75 or 80 votes not just 60 votesMaybe one of the times the White House decided to pull the plug onSeptember 15 may have come on August 5 when the Group of 6 had our lastmeeting with President Obama He was the only one from the White Housethere and the six of us It was a very casual discussionI said this before so I am not saying something that has not beensaid But President Obama made one request of me and I asked him aquestion For my part I said You know it would make it a heck of alot easier to get a bipartisan agreement if you would just say youcould sign a bill without a public option That is no different thanwhat I said to him on March 5 when I was down at the White House thatthe public option was a major impediment to getting a bipartisanagreement Then he asked me would I be willing to be one of threeRepublicans along with the rest of the Democrats to provide 60 votesMy answer was upfront No As I told him you can clarify with SenatorBaucus sitting right here beside you that 4 or 5 months before that Itold Senator Baucus Dont plan on three Republicans providing themargin that we were here to help get a broadbased consensus asSenator Baucus and I said early on this year that something thismassive ought to pass with a wide bipartisan majorityMr President I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of aquorum President I ask unanimous consent that the orderfor the quorum call be rescindedThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Bennet Without objection it is soordered In thepart of my statement where I refer to the July 8 meeting with SenatorReid it was only Snowe Grassley and Enzi not the other Senators Inamed So I wish to correct that for the Record  I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorumcall be rescinded President I have said for the last 2 days I wasgoing to speak on the Dorgan amendment a bipartisan amendment to allowthe importation of drugs into the United States I havent done ituntil now so I am glad to rise in support of this bipartisan amendmentto add provisions of the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug SafetyAct to this bill That legislation is the result of a collaborativeeffort by Senators Dorgan Snowe MCCain and this Senator to finallymake drug importation legalI have for a long time been a proponent of drug reimportation In2000 2002 and 2003 I supported an amendment permitting theimportation of prescription drugs into the United States from onecountry Canada This amendment is much broader than only CanadaIn 2004 the late Senator Kennedy and I worked together on a billthat would authorize drug importation but it did not survive thepartisan politics of this Chamber I then introduced my owncomprehensive drug importation bill in 2004 That was S 2307 theReliable Entry for Medicines at Everyday Discounts Through theImportation with Effective Safeguards Act The REMEDIES Act is what theacronym finally spells out In 2005 I combined my bill with a proposalsponsored by Senators Dorgan and Snowe In 2007 we reintroduced aversion of that legislation with the hope that our combined effortswould finally lower the cost of prescription drugs for all AmericansThat is what we are still working together to do this very day I thankSenator Dorgan for his leadershipThis time around I should be confident that this effort will finallypass Historically Democrats claim to be champions of holding the bigpharmaceutical companies accountable Now we have a Democraticsupermajority in the Congress and a Democratic President who hassupported drug importation in the past I am not as confident as maybeI should be That is because the White House has participated in somebackroom negotiations since the last time this legislation was broughtbefore the Senate and then Senator Obama supported it Behind closeddoors the Democratic White House found new friends in thepharmaceutical industry Last summer the head of the pharmaceuticallobbying group bragged that drug manufacturers had negotiated a rocksolid dealthose are their wordswith the present administrationAn article in the New York Times detailed the administrations dealwith big drug companies This quote comes from the New York TimesForeseeing new profits from the expansion of healthcoverage big drug companies are spending as much as 150million on advertisements to support the Presidents planBut in 2008 when President Obama was campaigning for the position henow holds he promised thatWell take on drug and insurance companies hold themresponsible for the prices they charge and the harm theycauseCertainly the President knows that a great way to hold drugcompanies accountable is to allow drug importation In fact in 2004when he was a candidate to be a Member of this Chamber he challengedhis opponents to support drug importation He said at that timeI urge my opponent to stop siding with the drugmanufacturers and put aside his opposition to the reimportation of lowerpriced prescription drugs   But unfortunately it has been reported that during backroomnegotiations at the White House the big pharmaceutical companies haveconvinced the President to drop his strong support for drugimportationThe New York Times reports thatOn July 7Meaning this yearRham Emanuel President Obamas chief of staff   assured at least five pharmaceutical companies during a WhiteHouse meeting that there would be no provision in the finalhealth care package to allow the reimportation of cheaperdrugs   I thought we were going to hold drug companies accountable I thoughthealth care reform was supposed to drive down the cost of health careincluding the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans The Dorganamendment is a commonsense bipartisan approach to achieve both ofthese goals Drug importation achieves these goals without imposingarbitrary fees and without flexing the muscles of the FederalGovernmentI have always considered this a free trade issue I know most peoplesee it as a health issue and it is a health issue But I come at itfrom the point of view that there are only a couple items Americanscannot buy in this country from anyplace else in the world they want tobuy it One class is pharmaceutical drugs the other class is Cuban President I ask unanimous consent for 4 additionalminutes and that it come off the next block of time from our side Imports createcompetition and keep domestic industry more responsive to consumers Inthe United States we import everything consumers want So I ask againwhy not pharmaceuticals That is why it is a trade issue for me as muchas a health issue Consumers in the United States pay far more forprescription drugs than those in other countries If Americans couldlegally and safely access prescription drugs outside the United Statesthen drug companies would be forced to reevaluate their pricingstrategies They would no longer be able to gouge American consumers bymaking them pay more than their fair share for research anddevelopmentIt is true that pharmaceutical companies do not like the idea ofopening up America to the global marketplace They want to keep theUnited States closed to other markets in order to charge higher priceshereBased on the reports I just read it seems that the White House hasalready sided with the drug manufacturers and promised them the abilityto continue to gouge American consumers otherwise known as the statusquoThe debate is not over With the Dorgan amendment prescription drugcompanies will be forced to be competitive and establish fair prices inAmerica The drug companies will try to find loopholes in order toprotect their bottom lineThe Dorgan amendment would make such action illegal It would notallow manufacturers to discriminate against registered exporters orimporters It would prohibit drug companies from engaging in anyactions to restrict prohibit or delay the importation of a qualifyingdrugThe Dorgan amendment would give the Federal Trade Commission theauthority to prevent this kind of abuse It develops an effective andsafe system that gives Americans access to lower prices Our effortgoes to great lengths to ensure the safety of imported drugs TheDorgan amendment requires that all imported drugs be approved by theFDA It puts in place a stringent set of safety requirements that mustbe met before Americans can import drugs from that countryThe amendment requires all exporting pharmacies and importingwholesalers to be registered with the FDA and inspected It gives theauthority for the FDA to inspect the entire distribution chain forimported drugs It sets very stringent penalties for violations of thesafety requirements in this bill including criminal penalties and upto 10 years imprisonmentWe need to make sure Americans have even greater more affordableaccess to innovative drugs by further opening the doors to competitionin the global pharmaceutical industryIf my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are serious about bendingdown the cost curve of health care inflationand doing it in thatdirection the right directionthen they will support the Dorganamendment a bipartisan amendmentI yield the floor  President my friends on the other side of theaisle have consistently stated that this 2074page Reid bill accordingto the Joint Committee on Taxation is a net tax cut I want to putemphasis throughout my remarks on the word netYesterday a chart was used to illustrate this point This chart hadmultiple bars with dollar figures For example in 2019 the chartshowed a 408 billion net tax cut My Democratic friends said thisnumber came from the Joint Committee on Taxation a very responsibleintellectually honest groupUnfortunately the chart my friends were using was not entirely clearon how they came up with this net tax cut for Americans So it wasnatural for most of the fellow Senators and the country at large towonder how my Democratic friends got this number They said show me thedataTo clear up any confusion right here is the Joint Committee onTaxation table that the Democrats relied on to claim that the Reid billresults in a net tax cut Here it is We can see the negative 40786for example That is the figure that was used As the chart indicatesthese dollar amounts are in the millions so 40786 million The JointCommittee on Taxation says it this way This means negativethenegative mark therenegative 408 billionMy friends on the other side unfortunately did not explain what wasgoing on here It appears my friends simply made an assertion that theyhoped many of us and those in the media would believe But I cannot letmy Democratic friends get off the hook this easily Why Because theentire story is not being told so let me take a moment to explainFirst in simplest terms where you see negative numbers on thischart the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us there is some typeof tax benefit going to the taxpayers So this group and these groupshere wherever there is a negative here those are tax benefits to thebenefit of the taxpayersFor example families making 50000 to 75000 have a negative of10489 in their column This means the Joint Committee on Taxation istelling us that this income category is receiving 104 billion in taxbenefitsI hope you will listen closely When we see a negative number on thischart the Joint Committee on Taxation tells us there is a tax benefitso conversely where we see a positive number the Joint Committee onTaxation is telling us that these taxpayers are seeing a tax increaseI have actually enlarged those numbers the number of tax returns andthe dollar amounts where there is a positive number for individuals andfamilies Again these positive numbers indicate tax increaseMy friends have said that all tax returns in this chart are receivinga net tax cut If that were so why arent there negative numbers nextto all of the dollar amounts listed Because not everyone in this chartis receiving a tax cut despite what my friends have said Quite to thecontrary a group of taxpayers is clearly seeing a tax increase andthis group of taxpayers in middle income is seeing tax increasesI didnt come down to the floor to say my friends on the other sideof the aisle are wrong After all you can see here the negative40786 million figure they used is right there out in the open WhatI am doing is clarifying that my Democratic friends cannot spread this408 billion tax cut across all the affected taxpayers on this chartand then say that all have received a tax cutYou want to know why Because this chart produced by the nonpartisanJoint Committee on Taxation shows that taxes go up for those makingmore than 50000 and families making more than 75000 It is righthere in the yellow as you can seeThe numbers obviously do not lie I say the nonpartisan JointCommittee on Taxation I think everybody agrees is very intellectuallyhonest So let me give you my read on what the Joint Committee onTaxation is saying here as evidenced by the figures on the chartFirst there is a group of low and middleincome taxpayers whoclearly benefits under the 2074page bill that is before the SenateThey benefit from the government subsidy of health insurance Thisgroup however is relatively smallThere is another much larger group of middleincome taxpayers who areseeing their taxes go up due to one or a combination of the followingtax increases the highcost plan tax increase which actually is abrandnew tax the medical expense deduction limitation which used tobe 75 percent and now before you can deduct you have to have 10percent of your income be medical expenses or you dont deductanything so that is a tax increase and then a Medicare payroll taxincrease where everybody is going to paywell everybody over acertain income is going to pay an additional half a percentage pointor if you are selfemployed pay 1 percent more of payroll tax Ingeneral this group is not benefiting from the government subsidyAfter all how can a taxpayer see a tax cut if they are not eveneligible for the subsidyAlso there is an additional group of taxpayers who would be affectedby other tax increase provisions in the Reid bill that the JointCommittee on Taxation could not distribute in the way people aredistributed on this chart These undistributed tax increases includeamong others the cap on Federal savingsflexible savings accountsThen there is a tax on cosmetic surgeryMy friend from Idaho the author of the amendment before us MrCrapo recently received a letter from the Joint Committee on Taxationstating that this additional group exists and many in this group willmake less than 250000 and hence have a tax increase that is notaccounted for here and also a tax increase if they are under 250000That is a violation of the Presidents promise in the last campaignthat nobody under that figure would get a tax increaseonly peopleover 250000So you see my Democratic friends cannot No 1 say that alltaxpayers receive a tax cutI have proven that hereand No 2 saythat middleincome Americans will not see a tax increase under the ReidbillI yield the floor  Madam President I ask unanimous consent that the orderfor the quorum call be rescinded Madam President I know we have moved to the Omnibusappropriations bill to continue government and the time is running outfor the current authorization bill and this brings us back to theauthorization of spending but it also takes us away from health carereformOn this side of the aisle we have been waiting for a long period oftime to vote on some amendments that are now before the Senate such asthe Crapo motion which would send the bill back to committee to takeout the tax increases that are in it Then we also have the Dorganamendment I can understand why maybe the majority does not want tovote on Republican amendments but I sure dont understand why theywould object to voting on Senator Dorgans amendment a Democraticamendment because there have always been more Democrats thanRepublicans for the Dorgan amendment and quite frankly I am in aposition where I agree with that amendment I am a cosponsor of it Ithink we would have a great deal of bipartisan support for the Dorganamendment But now we are just automatically away from the health caredebate and those amendmentsSo I am wondering why we had to do this appropriations bill rightnow I think there is growing realization that maybe public reactionnegative reaction to the legislation before usremember that 2074page bill that is before usthe public is getting wise to what is inthat bill and there is objection to it and maybe now the majorityparty would like to have a little respite from that debate So Ithought I would come back to not the substance of the health carereform bill debate but to a lot of organizations that oppose it and whythey oppose it just to keep the publics attention that we on thisside of the aisle feel the health care issue is very importantAs I travel around Iowa I hear a lot of concern about outofcontrolgovernment spending People are worried about all of the bailouts thebanks and the automakers the automakers such as General Motors beingnationalized They are worried about the rising rate of unemploymentwhich is 10 percent now They dont see how we will ever dig ourselvesout of the deficit hole we are in a deficit that has been increased by13 trillion since President Obamas inaugurationAs Senator MCCain just pointed out the bill that has now come beforethe Senate to fully fund the Federal Government has 125percentincreases in it From that standpoint it seems to me we are gettingaway from a commonsense principle that we ought to use around here onspending and that is that spending shouldnt eat up any more than theeconomic growth of the tax base that is coming into the FederalTreasury to support that spending Quite obviously you cant have 125percent increases in appropriations this year over last year and lastyear was 9 percent over the previous year You just cant sustain thatCommon sense dictates against it But what rules here in Washington isjust a lot of nonsenseSo our constituents are confused They are confused as to why in theface of all these fiscal problems some in Congress are now proposing500 billion in tax increases Tax increases are very bad for theeconomy It is more difficult to get out of the recession asyou increase expenditures They dont understand why some are proposingthe largest Medicaid expansion since the programs creation They wantto know why they are proposing 500 billion in Medicare cuts to createan entirely new entitlement program that this country cant affordNowhere are these worries and this confusion more evident than amongbusiness leaders of America because business is where jobs are createdGovernment does not produce wealth government consumes wealth So ifyou want to expand the economy you do it through the private sectorThat is where the resources of government come from That is where theresources that sustain our people come fromSo whether it is a small business owner on Main Street or a CEO onWall Street the message is clear Stop spending get the economy backon track and get people back to workUnfortunately the health reform bill will not address any of thesegoals In fact it may just do the opposite Dont take my word for itLets take a look at what the groups that represent American businessesare sayingLets start with the Chamber of Commerce representing 3 millionAmerican businesses In a press release distributed November 19 1 dayafter the release of the Senate bill the Chamber called the Senatebill a Missed Opportunity to Enact Meaningful Reform That wastheir titleLet me go to a specific quoteThis bill still contains a governmentrun plan and anonerous employer mandate it taxes working Americans slashesMedicare spends over a trillion dollarsand after allthisCBO tells us 24 million Americans will still not havehealth insuranceThat doesnt sound like the kind of reform that is going to help getthe chamber members back on track hiring more workers so we can getthis unemployment down It sounds as though they will end up beingforced to pay higher taxes and cut jobs I am not an economist butthat certainly doesnt sound like a formula for getting this countryout of the recessionIn fact the chambers press release saysThe Chamber believes the path to a healthier economy is tocut taxes not to raise them by 500 billionThey go on to ask a question for which I still cant find an answerWhy is there still no meaningful medical liability reformIs currying favor with the trial lawyers worth passing up 50billion in CBO verified savingsI think it is pretty clear that the Chamber of Commerce doesnt thinkthis 25 trillion bill will cure what ails the US economyLets see what some other business groups have to say The NationalAssociation of Manufacturers put out a press release the same day asthe Chamber of Commerce November 19 The National Association ofManufacturers is the Nations largest industrial trade associationTheir members build the machines that keep America running so theyshould know a little bit about how to get our economy running againUnfortunately they see Senator Reids bill as a step in the wrongdirection Like the Chamber and like pretty much every other businessgroup the National Association of Manufacturers has announced thatthey cannot support the pending billI find it hard to believe that some Senators who claim to beprobusiness can support a bill that is opposed by almost the entirebusiness communityor am I missing something How can some Democratswho claim to want to get people back to work support a bill thateconomists from the far right to the far left say will reduce wages andincrease unemployment It just doesnt seem to make senseLike other business groups the National Association of Manufacturersis in favor of reform Manufacturers realize that we need health reformto lower costs increase access and improve quality But according totheir press release they cannot support a bill that willthis istheir quoteadd massive financial burdens to businesses that arealready struggling in this recession They go on to express deepconcern about huge tax increases that will hurt small businessmanufacturers and they are worried that both the socalled publicoption and the massive Medicaid expansion will just end up shiftingmore costs and higher premiums to private businessesThe National Association of Manufacturers ends their press release bysayingOppose the majority leaders bill and urge Senators to dothe same as it raises costs and ultimately will destroy jobsAgain I find myself asking how someone can claim to be probusinessbut support a bill that is so strongly opposed by the businesscommunityLets take a look at what small businesses have to say Maybe that iswhere the answer is You have to remember that small businesses create70 percent of the net new jobs in America In fact it was ChristinaRomer the Presidents top economic adviser who said in a recentWebcast that health care reform will benefit small businessnotburden itUnfortunately the National Federation of Independent Businesses thevoice of small businesses doesnt seem to agree After the release ofSenator Reids bill the National Federation of Independent Businessessaid thisThis kind of reform is not what we need to encourage smallbusiness to thrive We oppose the Patient Protection andAffordable Care Act due to the amount of new taxes thecreation of new mandates and the establishment of newentitlement programsLike the chamber and the National Association of Manufacturers smallbusinesses want and need reform probably more so than even chambermembers and the National Association of Manufacturers But it doesntsound as though the pending bill actually addresses the problems ofsmall business In fact it sounds as though the pending bill simplycreates a host of new problemsproblems at a time when this country iscoming back from the brink of the greatest economic downturn since theDepressionThe National Federation of Independent Businesses goes on to sayThere is no doubt all of these burdens will be paid for onthe backs of small businessesOver the coming weeks I am sure some Senators are going to come downhere and talk about all of the benefits for small businesses that arein this bill But in the interest of honest debate I hope they will atleast mention in their remarks that despite all of the socalledbenefits this bill is still opposed by the voices of Americas smallbusinesses It is still opposed by the National Federation ofIndependent Businesses I could go on and list about half a dozen otherbusiness groups that oppose this bill The Associated Builders andContractors the Independent Electrical Contractors the InternationalFranchise Association the National Association of Wholesalers theSmall Business and Entrepreneurship Council and the International FoodService Distribution Associationall of these groups recognize thedevastating impact this bill will have on our economyWe are facing the highest unemployment rate in 26 years We havealready seen the national debt increase by 13 trillion sinceinauguration or per household 11535 The pending bill misses the markon business top priority and that is lowering costs Dont take myword for it The Congressional Budget Office says the Reid bill bendsthe Federal spending curve further upward by a net of 160 billionbetween 2010 and 2019For these reasons the pending bill is opposed by these organizationsI have quoted the National Association of Manufacturers the Chamberof Commerce the National Federation of Independent Businesses as wellas almost every other business group based in Washington DC or maybefor all I know they are based in other parts of the country but theystill follow legislation here in this city in the CongressThe business community has spoken and their message is loud andclear For Senators who want to bend the growth curve downand that iswhat we all set out to do but we dont have a bill before us that doesitthis bill is not the answer For those Senators who want to getpeople back to work this bill is not the answerFor those Senators who want to get this countrys economy back ontrack this bill is not the answerIf you support American businessesand American businesses are whatprovide the income into the Federal Treasury whether it is corporatetax or income taxit seems to me that if you have pride in Americanbusinesses and the jobs they create you cannot support this billI yield the floorThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mrs MCCaskill The Senator from Washingtonis recognized  Madam President earlier today I explained to my fellowSenators and hopefully to my friends in the media that the Reid billdoes not provide a net tax cut for Americans Contrary to theDemocrats claims that seems to be the situation They claim there isa net tax cut I hope I proved earlier today that it does not have anet tax cut Some Americans are cut but dont forget that someAmericans have increases in taxes I pointed directly to this data asprepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation to show that a group ofmiddleincome taxpayers will see their taxes go up under the Reid billand that would be this class of taxpayers right here I dont disagreewith Democrats saying there is 40786 million of tax cuts but thereare also tax increases for a large share of AmericansI want to now build on those earlier remarks As I stated there isclearly a group of individuals and families who benefit from thegovernment subsidy for health care However that group is relativelysmall Another much larger group would see their taxes go up So I wantto take a minute to provide some statistics that we pulled from thedata of the Joint Committee on Taxation looking at both the winners andthe losers under the billFor the benefit of the public the Joint Committee on Taxation is anintellectually honest group of professionals who are nonpartisan andthey give Congress information on the impact of policies we make herein our various committees or as individuals or the Senate as a wholeAccording to this professional group the Joint Committee onTaxation out of those individuals and families affected by four majortax provisions under the Reid bill individuals earning more than50000 and families earning more than 75000 would see on averagetheir taxes going up Only individuals with incomes below 50000 andfamilies with incomes below 75000 would on average see some taxrelief on account of receiving subsidies for health insuranceThe data of the Joint Committee on Taxation indicates that in 2019individuals earning less than 50000 would on average receive taxrelief through this subsidy equal to 875 Families earning less than75000 would on average receive tax relief equal to 2031 from thesubsidy This socalled tax relief however is in the form of anadvance refundable tax credit that is delivered directly to theinsurance company providing health insurance coverage not to theindividual but signed sealed and delivered directly to the insurancecompany100 percent of it I repeat not to the individual but to theinsurance company Clearly this group is a winner under the Reid billBut the same data from the Joint Committee on Taxation indicates thatin 2019 individuals earning between 50000 and 200000 would onaverage see a tax increase of 593 That is for individuals Nowlets go to families earning between 75000 and 200000 They wouldon average see a tax increase of 670So what does all this mean This means the Reid bill does not cuttaxes for all Americans To the contrary the Reid bill breaks Obamaspromise not to tax individuals making less than 200000 and familiesmaking less than 250000 a year And you just cant know how manytimes President Obama during his Presidential campaignwhether indebates or in individual appearances when he was a candidatemade itvery clear that nobody with under 200000 a year in income was goingto see a tax increase To the contrary the Reid bill breaks PresidentObamas pledge not to tax individuals making less than 200000 andthen a higher figure for families making less than 250000Does the tax relief provided to individuals earning less than 50000and families making less than 75000 represent a tax cut Generallyno because based upon the report of the Joint Committee on Taxationof the 395 billion the government will spend on tax credits for healthinsuranceor subsidies for health insurance288 billion will berefundable meaning individuals and families who have no tax liabilitywill still receive the full benefit The Joint Committee on Taxationtells us that the remaining 106 billion will go toward reducing realtax liabilityThe Congressional Budget Office classifies a benefit provided to taxfilers with no tax liability as government spending not as a taxdecrease This is compared to a tax benefit that actually will reduce ataxpayers tax liability This means the 288 billion of governmentspending through the Tax Code cannot be considered a true taxreductionThe Democrats count the 288 billion in government spending whenclaiming the Reid bill provides a tax cut And the reason is if theDemocrats do not count this government spending as a tax cut theycould not hide the fact that the Reid bill increases taxesBottom line The Reid bill does not provide a net tax cut Insteadthe billraises taxes and it raises taxes on individuals and families earningless than 250000 contrary to Candidate Obamas presentation duringthe campaign that nobody below that figure would get a tax increaseCheck the data No one can dispute it It is right here in thesefigures Everybody in the United States is represented by these figureshere highlighted They are the ones who are going to get a taxincrease That is the rest of the storyI yield the floor  Madam President my friends on the other side of theaisle have taken to the floor to make the argument in favor of the Reidbill that it eliminates a socalled hidden tax What is this socalledhidden tax The other party argues that there is a hidden health taxthat families pay in increased premium costs to cover the costs ofcaring for the uninsured In short when doctors and hospitals providetreatment to the uninsured they are forced to compensate for thisuncompensated care and do so by charging more to private healthinsurers The cost of this care that is shifted to the insurers is thenpassed on to health care consumers in the form of higher healthinsurance premiums Unfortunately this socalled hidden tax is oftenoverstatedFamilies USA conducted a study attempting to quantify the cost shiftassociated with uncompensated care According to this study about 43billion in uncompensated care is shifted to private health insurancewhich led Families USA to conclude that there is a hidden tax of about1100 that families pay in increased premiums A Kaiser FamilyFoundation study dissected the Families USA numbers and estimated thatthe total amount of uncompensated care shifted to private insurers wascloser to 11 billion making the socalled hidden tax around 200 fora family compared to the 1100 that Families USA said Let me givesome ground to my friends on the other side and assume that the hiddentax does equal that higher figure 1100 as compared to the KaiserFamily Foundation figure of 200The Democrats bill does not get rid of the hidden tax entirelyActually this bill makes it worse How First the Democrats healthcare reform bill still leaves a large number of Americans uninsuredSpecifically the Reid bill leaves 23 million out of 54 million stillwithout health insurance at the end of this decade remembering thatthis bill does not actually take effect until 2014 So between 2014 andat the end of the budget window we still have 23 million peoplewithout health insurance At best the reform in this 2074pageDemocratic bill cut the hidden tax in half in this case to about 500for a familyThe Reid bill adds however new hidden taxes These impose 67billion worth of socalled fees on health insurance companies and selfinsured arrangements beginning in 2010 The Congressional BudgetOffice the Joint Committee on Taxation the nonpartisan experts andofficial congressional scorekeepers have testified that these fees willbe passed on to health care consumersThe Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxationhave further testified that this will result in higher insurancepremiums for all Americans The actuaries at OliverWyman estimate thatthe fees imposed on health insurers would add 488 to the cost of theaverage family health insurance policy A new hidden tax is alsocreated as a result of the Medicaid expansion and Medicare cuts Themajor cost shift in health care derives from the government programsMedicare and Medicaid which reimburse providers at rates roughly 20percent to 40 percent lower than what private providers pay to the samedoctors and hospitalsPresident Obama understands that paying doctors below market ratesleads to a cost shift After all in a townhall on health care reformthe President saidIf theyre only collecting 80 cents on the dollar theyvegot to make it up somewhere and they end up getting it frompeople who have private insuranceThe Medicare and Medicaid cost shift will be increased significantlyunder the Democrats health care reform bill According to CBOsestimate Medicaid will be increased by more than 40 percent from 35million to 50 million people by the end of the budget window in 2019Additionally the bill includes almost 12 trillion in Medicare cutswhich will result in lower payments to providersThe actuaries at Milliman Consulting studied the current costshifting resulting from Medicare and Medicaid underpaying providers andfound that this cost shift for Medicare and Medicaid totaled almost 89billion per year adding 1788 to the current family health insurancepolicy Increasing the current Medicare and Medicaid cost shift as aresult of this 2074page health reform bill before us would add evenmore cost to a family health insurance policyThe easier cost shift to address would be the 1700 cost shift fromdefensive medicine The Democrats do not address cost shift fromdefensive medicine which Dr Mark MCClellan former head of CMS andDaniel Kessler estimated adds 1700 in additional cost per averagefamily Addressing this reform alone could save more than covering allof the uninsuredSo you see the Democrats say their bill will eliminate the socalledhidden tax My friends seem to come up short on that one Also myfriends add new hidden taxes that will burden middleclass AmericansI ask my friends to be transparent when they are talking aboutgetting rid of the hidden tax The Democratic health reform billactually makes things worseI yield the floorThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Whitehouse The Senator from Utah  President I dont rise to add to what the Senatorfrom New Jersey said I just wish to take this opportunity to tell himI agree with him and I appreciate his leadership on this issue overseveral yearseven the years before he came to the SenateOften I am asked in my State because we can export so muchagricultural stuff if I would vote to open trade with Cuba I said Iam willing to open trade for Cuba when they give political freedom andeconomic freedom to the people of that country because this dictatorhas run Cuba into the most impoverished country in the world Before hetook over they had a very viable middle class and they were aprosperous countryI stand ready to help the Senator on what he is trying to do in thatarea
S_UT_HATCH,2009-12-11, President I appreciate the remarks of mydistinguished colleague from Florida People need to listen to him Iam grateful to have him in the Senate a fine man he is and a goodexample to all of us I appreciate his remarksI rise to explain why I believe the Reid health care bill is not onlybad policy for this country but also undermines the Constitution andthe liberty it makes possible I urge my colleagues to resist twoerrors that can distort our judgment and lead us down the wrongpath Those errors are assuming that the Constitution allows whateverwe want to do and ignoring this question altogetherWe have only the powers the Constitution grants us because libertyrequires limits on government power and we have our own responsibilityto make sure we stay within those limitsJames Madison said that if men were angels no government would benecessary and if angels were to govern men no limits on governmentwould be necessary Because neither men nor the governments they createare angelic government and limits on government are both necessary toprotect libertynot just government but limits on government as wellThose limits come primarily from a written Constitution which delegatesenumerated powers to the Federal GovernmentHere is how the Supreme Court put it just a few years ago This is inUnited States v Morrison in 2000 quoting Marbury v Madisonone ofthe most important decisions ever by the Supreme Court probably thesingle most important decisionback in 1803Every law enacted by Congress must be based on one or moreof its powers enumerated in the Constitution The powers ofthe legislature are defined and limited and that thoselimits may not be mistaken or forgotten the constitution iswrittenThe important word there happens to be limitsNo one likes limits least of all politicians with grand plans andaggressive agendas It is tempting to ignore or forget the limits theConstitution imposes on us by pretending the Constitution meanswhatever we want it to mean But we take an oath to support and defendthe Constitution not to make the Constitution support and defend usThe Constitution cannot limit government if government controls theConstitutionIn April 1992 during a debate on welfare reform legislation thesenior Senator from New York Mr Moynihan with whom I served made apoint of order that an amendment offered by a Republican Senator wasunconstitutional Here is what Senator Moynihan saidWe do not take an oath to balance the budget and we do nottake an oath to bring about universal peace but we do takean oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the UnitedStatesApplying that sage advice today we do not take an oath to reform thehealth care system or to bring about universal insurance coverage butwe do take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the UnitedStatesFor the past 8 years my friends on the other side of the aisleinsisted that the Constitution sets definite and objective limits thatthe President must obey The Constitution they said does not meanwhatever the President wants it to mean Compelling circumstances oreven national crises they said cannot change the fact that theConstitution controls the President not the other way aroundIt is easy to insist that the Constitution controls another branch ofgovernment that the Constitution does not mean whatever another branchof government wants it to mean The real test of our commitment toliberty however is our willingness to point that same finger atourselvesI ask my colleagues is the Constitution rock solid unchanging andsupreme for the executive branch but malleable shapeshifting and inthe eye of the beholder for the legislative branchA principle applied only to others is just politics and politicsalone cannot protect liberty We must be willing to say that there arelines we may not cross means we may not use and steps we may nottakeThe Constitution empowers Congress to do many things for the Americanpeople Just as important however is that the Constitution also setslimits on our power We cannot take the power without the limitsI want to address several constitutional issues raised by thislegislationThe first is the requirement in section 1501 that individuals obtainnot simply health insurance but a certain level of insurance Failureto meet this requirement results in a financial penalty which is to beassessed and collected through the Internal Revenue CodeWe hear a lot about how Senators on this side of the aisle aresupposedly defending the big evil insurance companies while those onthe other side of the aisle are defenders of American families Thisinsurance mandate exposes such partisan hypocrisyLet me just ask you one simple question Who would benefit the mostfrom the unprecedented mandate to purchase insurance or face a penaltyenforced by our friends at the Internal Revenue Service The answer issimple There are two clear winners under this Draconian policy andneither is the American family The first winner is the FederalGovernment which could easily use this authority to increase thepenalty or impose similar ones to create new streams of revenue to fundmore outofcontrol spending Second the insurance companies are themost direct winners under this insurance mandate because it would forcemillions of Americans who would not otherwise do so to become theircustomers I cannot think of a biggerwindfall for corporations than the Federal Government orderingAmericans to buy their productsRight now States are responsible for determining the policies thatbest meet the particular demographic needs and challenges of their ownresidents That is the States Massachusetts for example has decidedto implement a health insurance mandate while Utah has decided not todo so This bill would eliminate this State flexibility so that theFederal Government may impose yet another onesizefitsall mandate onall 50 States and on every American I cannot think of anything more atodds with the system of federalism that Americas Founders establisheda system designed to limit government and protect libertyI can understand why this mandate is so attractive to those whobelieve in an allpowerful Federal Government After all raising thepercentage of those with health insurance is easy by simply orderingthose without insurance to buy it But while government may choose theends the Constitution determines the permissible means That is whyone of the basic principles is that Congress must identify at least oneof our powers enumerated in the Constitution as the basis for anylegislation we ultimately passThe health insurance mandate is separate from the penalty used toenforce it The only enumerated power that can conceivably justify themandate is the power to regulate interstate commerce For more than acentury the Supreme Court treated this as meaning what it saysCongress cannot use its power to regulate commerce in order to regulatesomething that is not commerce Congress cannot use its power toregulate interstate commerce in order to regulate intrastate commerceIn classic judicial understatement the Supreme Court has said thatour understanding of the reach of the commerce clause    hasevolved over time Indeed it has Since the 1930s the Supreme Courthas expanded the power to regulate interstate commerce to includeregulating activities that substantially affect interstate commerceThat is obviously far beyond by orders of magnitude what the commercepower was intended to mean but that is where things stand today andsome say it justifies this health insurance mandate in this billUsing the Constitution or even the Supreme Courts revision of theConstitution as a guide requires more than a good intention fueled byan active imagination The Supreme Court has certainly expanded thecategory of activitiesget that word activitiesthat Congress mayregulate But every one of its cases has involved Congress seeking toregulate just that activities in which people have chosen to engageEven the Supreme Court has never abandoned that category altogether andallowed Congress instead to require that individuals engage inactivities in this case by purchasing a particular good or serviceThe Court has never done thatLet me mention just three of the Supreme Courts commerce clausecases In its very first case Gibbons v Ogden in 1824 Thomas Gibbonshad received a Federal license to operate a steamboat between NewJersey and New York and wanted to compete with Aaron Ogden who hadbeen granted a steamboat monopoly by New York State In Wickard vFilburn Roscoe Filburn used the winter wheat he planted on his Ohiofarm to feed his livestock and make bread for his own dinner table Inthe winter of 1942 he grew more wheat than allowed under theAgricultural Adjustment Act and challenged the resulting fine And inHodel v Surface Mining  Reclamation Association companies challengeda Federal statute regulating surface coal miningThese cases have two things in common The Supreme Court upheldFederal authority in each case but each case involved an activityremember the word activityin which individuals chose to engageThere would have been no Gibbons v Ogden if Thomas Gibbons had notchosen to operate a steamboat Congress could regulate his activity butcould not have required that he engage in it There would have been noWickard v Filburn if Roscoe Filburn had not chosen to grow wheatCongress could regulate his activity but not have required that heengage in it And there would have been no Hodel case if companies hadnot chosen to mine coal Congress could regulate their activity butcould not have required that they engage in itThe key word in the commerce clause is the word regulate and thekey word in every Supreme Court case about the commerce clause is theword activity Regulating an activity in which individuals chose toengage is one thing requiring that they engage in that activity isanotherThe Congressional Budget Office examined the 1994 health care reformlegislation which also included a mandate to purchase health insuranceHere is the CBOs the Congressional Budget Offices conclusion Thisis August 1994 the Congressional Budget OfficeA mandate requiring all individuals to purchase healthinsurance would be an unprecedented form of federal actionThe government has never required people to buy a particulargood or service   Federal mandates typically apply topeople as parties to economic transactions rather thanmembers of societyThat is pretty important language In other words Congress canregulate commercial activities in which people choose to engage butcannot require that they engage in those commercial activitiesJust a few months ago as Congress once again is considering a healthinsurance mandate the Congressional Research Service examined the sameissue Here is what the Congressional Research Service concluded Thiswas in July 2009 The CRS concludedWhether such a requirement to have health insurance wouldbe constitutional under the Commerce Clause is perhaps themost challenging question posed by such a proposal as it isa novel issue whether Congress may use this clause to requirean individual to purchase a good or serviceCan Congress use this clause to require an individual to purchase agood or serviceOne thing did change in the legal landscape between 1994 when CBOcalled the health insurance mandate unprecedented and 2009 whenCRS called it novel The Supreme Court twice found that there arelimits to what Congress may do in the name of regulating interstatecommerceIn United States v Lopez the Court rejected a version of thecommerce power that would make it hard to posit any activity by anindividual that Congress is without power to regulateIf there is no difference between regulating and requiring whatpeople do if there is no difference between incentives and mandatesif Congress may require that individuals purchase a particular good orservice why did we even bother with the Cash for Clunkers Program Whydid we bother with TARP or other bailouts We could simply require thatAmericans buy certain cars or appliances invest in certain companiesor deposit their paychecks in certain banks For that matter we couldattack the obesity problem by requiring Americans to buy fruits andvegetables and to eat only thoseSome say that because State governments may require drivers to buycar insurance the Federal Government may require that everyonepurchase health insurance That is too simplistic that argumentSimply stating that point should be enough to refute it States may domany things that the Federal Government may not and if you do notdrive a car you do not have to buy car insurance This legislationwould require individuals to have health insurance simply because theyexist even if they never see a doctor for the rest of their livesThe defenders of this health insurance mandate must know that theyare on shaky constitutional ground The bill before us now includesfindings which attempt to connect the mandate to the Constitution Iassume they are the best arguments that this unprecedented and novelmandate is constitutionalThose findings fail in at least four waysFirst the findings say that the requirement to purchase healthinsurance will add millions of new consumers to the health insurancemarket I cannot dispute the observation that requiring more people topurchase health insurance will result in more people having healthinsurance I think that seems quite selfevident But the question isnot the effect of the mandate but the authority for the mandateLiberty requires that the ends cannot justify the means The findingsalso fail to establish that the insurance mandate is constitutional byfailing to offer a single examplea single precedent a single casein which Congress has required individuals to purchase a particulargood or service or the courts have upheld such a requirement The casesI described are typical and similar examples are legion Every oneinvolvesevery one of those cases I have citedthe regulation ofactivity in which individuals choose to engage Requiring that theindividual engage in such activity is a difference not in degree but inkindThe findings also fail to answer the question by observing thatStates such as Massachusetts have required that individuals purchasehealth insurance As I noted regarding the example of car insuranceour Federal and State system allows States to do many things that theFederal Government may not That is one of those limits on the FederalGovernment that is necessary to protect libertyThe findings fail to answer the question by mistakenly focusing onwhether Congress may regulate the sale of insurance That misses thepoint in two respects Simply because Congress may regulate the sale ofhealth insurance does not mean that the Congress may require it Simplybecause Congress may regulate the sale of health insurance does notmean that Congress may regulate the purchase of health insurance Thislegislation requires you to believe that nonactivity is the same asactivity that choosing not to do something is the same as choosing todo it that regulating what individuals do is the same as requiringthem to do it That notion makes no common sense and it certainlymakes no constitutional sense If Congress can require individuals tospend their own money on a particular good or service simply becauseCongress thinks it is important then the Constitution means whateverCongress says it means and there are and will be no limits to theFederal Governments power over each and every one of our livesThat version of Federal power will be exactly what the Supreme Courtin Lopez prohibited namely that there would be no activity byindividuals that the Federal Government may not control Neither thepower to regulate interstate granted by the Constitution nor the powerto regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commercegranted by the Supreme Court go that far They dont go that farThe American people agree A national poll conducted last month foundthat 75 percent of Americans believe that requiring them to purchasehealth insurance is unconstitutional because Congresss power toregulate commerce does not include telling Americans what they mustbuy By a margin of more than 7 to 1 Americans believe that electedofficials should be more concerned with upholding the Constitutionregardless of what might be popular than enacting legislation even ifit is not constitutionalSome defenders of this legislation such as the House majority leaderhave said that Congress may require individuals to purchase healthinsurance because it can pass legislation to promote the generalwelfare The only thing necessary to dismiss this argument is to readthe Constitution Read the Constitution That dismisses this argumentJust read it Read the Constitution Article I refers to generalwelfare as a purpose not as a power It is a purpose that limitsrather than expands Congresss power to tax and to spend Therequirement that individuals purchase health insurance is not anexercise of either the power to tax or the power to spend and so eventhe purpose of general welfare is not connected to it at all Needlessto say it makes no sense to include in a written Constitution designedto limit Federal Government power an openended catchall provisionempowering Congress to do anything it thinks serves the generalwelfareIf Americas Founders wanted to create a Federal Government with thatmuch power they could have written a much shorter Constitution onethat simply told Congress to go for it and legislate well That is whatthey could have done They didnt do that thank goodnessThe Heritage Foundation has just published an important paper arguingthat this health insurance mandate is both unprecedented andunconstitutional It is authored by Professor Randy Barnett theCormack Waterhouse Professor of Legal Theory at the George WashingtonLaw Center Nathaniel Stewart an attorney with the prestigious lawfirm of White  Case and Todd Gaziano Director of the Center forJudicial and Legal Studies at the Heritage FoundationI ask unanimous consent to have the conclusion portion of the LegalMemorandum published by the Heritage Foundation printed in the RecordThere being no objection the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record as followsConclusionIn theory the proposed mandate for individuals to purchasehealth insurance could be severed from the rest of the 2000pluspage reform bill The legislations key sponsorshowever have made it clear that the mandate is an integralindeed essential part of the bill After all therevenues paid by conscripted citizens to the insurancecompanies are needed to compensate for the increased costsimposed upon these companies and the health care industry bythe myriad regulations of this billThe very reason why an unpopular health insurance mandatehas been included in these bills shows why if it is heldunconstitutional the remainder of the scheme will provepolitically and economically disastrous Members need onlyrecall how the Supreme Courts decision in Buckley v Valeowhich invalidated caps on campaign spending asunconstitutional while leaving the rest of the schemeintacthas created 30 plus years of incoherent andpernicious regulations of campaign financing and the need forrepeated reforms Only this time the public is alignedagainst a scheme that will require repeated unpopular votesespecially to raise taxes to compensate for the absence ofthe health insurance mandateThese political considerations are beyond the scope of thispaper and the expertise of its authors But Senators andRepresentatives need to know that despite what they havebeen told the health insurance mandate is highly vulnerableto challenge because it is in truth unconstitutional Andpolitical considerations aside each legislator owes a dutyto uphold the Constitution I also wish to share with my colleagues a letter Ireceived from Dr Michael Adams and attorney Carroll Robinson They areon the faculty of the Barbara Jordan Mickey Leeland School of PublicAffairs at Texas Southern University Mr Robinson a former member ofthe Houston City Council was named by the Democratic LeadershipCouncil in 2000 to its list of 100 to WatchI ask unanimous consent their entire letter which is dated October25 2009 be printed in the Record following my remarks Thisis an excerpt from Michael Adams PhD and Carroll G RobinsonEsquire from the Barbara Jordan and Mickey Leland School of PublicAffairs Texas Southern UniversityOur reading of the Constitution and Supreme Court precedentcould not identify any reasonable basis expressed orimplied for granting Congress the broad sweeping andunprecedented power that is represented by the individualmandate requirement In fact we could not find any courtdecision state or federal that said or implied that theConstitution gave Congress the power to mandate citizens buya particular good or service or be subject to a financialpenalty levied by the government for not doing soThat is pretty impressive stuffIt is certainly possible to achieve the goal of greater healthinsurance coverage by constitutional means not unconstitutional meansI am quite certain however that those means are politicallyimpossibleLiberty requires that the Constitution trump politics but in thelegislation before us politics trumps the ConstitutionAnother provision in this legislation that is inconsistent with theConstitution is section 9001 which imposes an excise tax on highcostemployersponsored insurance plans differently in some States than inothers The legislation imposes a tax equal to 40 percent of benefitsabove a prescribed limit but raises that limit in 17 States to bedetermined by the Secretaries of the Treasury and Health and HumanServicesMy colleague from Ohio Senator Brown spoke against this provisionon policy grounds earlierThe Constitution allows Congress to impose excise taxes but requiresthatthey be uniform throughout the United States This is one of thoseprovisions that will be dismissed with pejorative labels such asarchaic by those who find it annoying But it is right there in thesame Constitution that we have all sworn to uphold We have all swornthat same oath to protect and defend and we are just as bound today toobey itFrankly a good test of our commitment to the Constitution is when wemust obey a provision that limits what we want to doThe Supreme Court has had relatively few opportunities to interpretand apply the uniformity clause but its cases do provide some basicprinciples which I think easily apply to the legislation before ustoday The Court has held for example that a Federal excise tax mustbe applied with the same force and effect in every place where thesubject of it is foundThe Congress has wide latitude in determining what to tax and maytailor a regional solution to a geographically isolated problem butlaws drawn explicitly in terms of State lines will receive heightenedscrutiny By the plain terms of the legislation before us insuranceplans providing a certain level of benefits in one State will be taxedwhile the very same plans providing the very same benefits in anotherwill not be taxed We do not yet know what States will be treateddifferently but we do know according to this bill that 17 of themwill That actually makes the constitutional point more clearly byidentifying the Statebased discrimination more starkly Congress maydecide to tax insurance plans with benefits that exceed a particularlimit but the tax must have the same force and effect wherever thatsubject of the tax is found That is the clear meaning of theconstitutional provision and the clear holding of the Supreme Courtsprecedents Taxing the same insurance plans differently in one Statethan in another is the opposite of taxing them uniformly throughout theUnited StatesI commend to my colleagues the work of Professor Thomas Colby of theGeorge Washington University Law School whose comprehensive work onthe uniformity clause was published in volume 91 of the Virginia LawReviewI asked the Congressional Research Service to look at this uniformityclause issue Its report confirmed that this differential tax on highcost insurance plans is drawn explicitly along State lines and that acourt will more closely scrutinize the reasons for the Statebaseddistinction It also concluded that Congress has not articulated anyjustification for singling out certain States for different treatmentI have raised this issue over and over throughout the process ofdeveloping and considering this legislation I serve on both of theSenate committees that are involved in this process In fact I can sayI have served on three not only the HELP Committeethe HealthEducation Labor and Pensions Committeebut also the FinanceCommittee as well as the Judiciary Committee that for some reasonhas some great interest in the Constitution I have never heard anyjustification for singling out certain States for different taxtreatmentThe attitude seems to be that this is what the majority wants to doso they are going to do it no matter what the Constitution says Thatmay be politically possible but that does not make it constitutionallypermissibleOther legal analysts and scholars who are examining this health caretakeover legislation are raising additional constitutional objectionsProfessor Richard Epstein of the University of Chicago School of Lawfor example focuses on provisions that restrict insurance providersability to make their own riskadjusted decisions about coverage andpremiums He argues these restrictions amount to a taking of privateproperty without just compensation and in violation of the fifthamendmentOthers have observed that the legislation requires States toestablish health benefit exchanges It does not ask cajole encourageor even bribe them It simply orders State legislatures to passlegislation creating these health benefit exchanges and says if Statesdo not do so the Secretary of Health and Human Services will establishthe exchanges for them How thoughtfulBut as the Supreme Court said in FERC v Mississippi in 1982This Court never has sanctioned explicitly a federalcommand to the States to promulgate and enforce laws andregulationsThe Supreme Court reaffirmed a decade later in New York v UnitedStates that the Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confersupon Congress the power to regulate individuals not StatesIn that case the Court struck down Federal legislation that wouldpress State officials into administering a Federal programMore recently in Printz v United States the Supreme Court statedWe have held however that State legislatures are notsubject to Federal directionYet this legislation does what these cases said Congress may not doIt commands States to pass laws it regulates States in their capacityas States and it attempts to make States subject to Federal directionLet me return to the principles with which I began Liberty requireslimits on government power Those limits come primarily from a writtenConstitution which delegates enumerated powers to Congress We must beable to identify at least one of those enumerated powers to justifylegislation and those powers should not mean whatever we in ourdelightful wisdom want them to meanThose principles lead me to conclude that Congress does not have theauthority to require that individuals purchase health insurance andthat Congress cannot tax certain health insurance plans in some Statesbut not in othersThese and the others I have mentioned are only some of theconstitutional issues raised by this legislation Any of these andothers I have not mentioned could well be the basis for futurelitigation challenging this legislation should it become lawWriting for the Supreme Court in 1991 Justice Sandra Day OConnorreminded usThe Constitution created a Federal Government of limitedpowersAmericas Founders she wrote limited Federal Government power toprotect our fundamental libertiesHere is the way Justice OConnor put it writing for the SupremeCourt in New York v United States in 1992But the Constitution protects us from our own bestintentions It divides power among sovereigns and amongbranches of government precisely so that we may resist thetemptation to concentrate power in one location as anexpedient solution to the crisis of the dayThat is a pretty remarkable statement I could not have said itbetter myself Those are either principles we must obey or cliches wemay ignoreIf the Constitution means anything anymore if it does what it wascreated to do by not only empowering but more importantly limitinggovernment power then now is the time to stand on principle ratherthan to slip on politicsI yield the floorExhibit 1October 25 2009Hon Orrin G HatchUS SenatorDear Senator Hatch We support reducing the cost of healthinsurance and expanding access to quality affordableprevention wellness and health care services for allAmericans Despite our support for health care reform thatempowers consumers we have serious concerns about theconstitutionality of the individual mandate requirement beingproposed by CongressAt least one scholar has argued that the individual mandaterequirement is constitutional because Congress has unlimitedauthority under the Commerce Clause to regulate the economicactivity of individual American citizens no matter howinfinitesimalWe do not agree with that position In Philadelphia theFramers established a federal government of limited powersIf Congress has unlimited power under the Commerce Clause toregulate the economic activity of citizens then theConstitution is no longer and never was a promise   that there is a realm of personal liberty which thegovernment may not enterWe believe that this promise still exists and is not amirage The Supreme Court said so at least as recently as2003It has also been argued that the individual mandate isconstitutional because citizens have no fundamental rightto be uninsured or to decline insurance These arestrawman characterizations intended to distract attentionfrom the real constitutional question Does Congress have thepower to mandate citizens buy a specific good or service orbe subjected to a financial penalty for not doing soOur reading of the Constitution and Supreme Court precedentcould not identify any reasonable basis expressed orimplied for granting Congress the broad sweeping andunprecedented power that is represented by the individualmandate requirement In fact we could not find any courtdecision state or federal that said or implied that theConstitution gave Congress the power to mandate citizens buya particular good or service or be subject to a financialpenalty levied by the government for not doing soThere are cases that say Congress can tell consumers whatproducts to buy if they choose to buy but no cases that sayCongress can mandate that a citizen must buy a particulargood or service or be fined for not doing soThe individual mandate requirement directly burdens thefundamental meaning of being an American citizen as embodiedin the Ninth Amendment reaching back through the Declarationof Independence to the Magna Carta and its expansion comingforward from the 35ths Clause of Article I of theConstitution and the Courts Dred Scott decision to theThirteenth Fourteenth Fifteenth Nineteenth TwentyFourthand TwentySixth Amendments as well as through Supreme Courtdecisions related to these amendments legislation adoptedpursuant to them the Bill of Rights and its penumbraThe Supreme Court has ruled that freedom of speechexpression and association are constitutionally protectedOur right to freely move around the country is alsoconstitutionally protected Congress can regulate the size ofpolitical donations but has no authority to tell a citizenwhich political candidate or party they can lawfullycontribute toLike political donations how a citizen legally spendstheir money in the market place is clearly a form ofexpression and association that requires strict scrutiny orheightened protectionCalling the individual mandate a tax raises anotherconstitutional concern Under the mandate American citizensare essentially subject to a financial penalty simply forbeing a citizen of the United States residing in a state ofthe Union It is essentially an existence fee a fee forexistingUnder the Fourteenth Amendment the definition ofcitizenship does not include any requirement that Americanspay a tax simply because we are citizens In fact theTwentyFourth Amendment and related Supreme Court decisionsexpressly prohibit financially burdening the rights ofcitizens to prevent them from exercising a right ofcitizenship Citizens have a liberty interest in decidingwhen to buy a good or service and which to buy form thelegally available optionsThe Supreme Court has said Had those who drew andratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment orthe Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty inits manifold possibilities they might have been morespecific They did not presume to have this insight Theyknew times can blind us to certain truths and    laws oncethought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppressAs the Constitution endures persons in every generation caninvoke its principles in their own search for greaterfreedomWe believe that reducing the cost of health care insuranceand expanding coverage can be achieved without opening theconstitutional Pandoras Box of the individual mandaterequirementSincerelyCarroll G Robinson EsqMichael O Adams PhD
S_IA_GRASSLEY,2009-12-17, President I ask unanimous consent to speak as inmorning business for 10 minutes President I rise on the issue of jobs and 10percent unemployment and to tell my fellow Senators what we can do topreserve maybe 25000 jobs in an industry that by the end of themonth will be otherwise shut down because Congress is not takingaction The main point of my remarks is if we dont extend thebiodiesel tax credit by the end of the month these jobs will be lostMy point is 23000 jobs will be lost In fact right now on December17 companies are making plans to shut down these operations by the endof the yearEverybody knows our unemployment rate is 10 percent Everybody knowsthe President has spent a great deal of time over the last 2 or 3weeks talking about creating jobs and getting us out of the recessionBut we have to remember that for those without work this is not just arecession it is a depressionWe all agree we should take whatever action is necessary to jumpstart our economy and get people back to work President Obama and VicePresident Biden have been talking for months about the need to creategreen jobs Well green jobs purple jobs whatever kind of jobs jobsare jobs I dont object to the creation of green jobs In fact what Iam talking about is some of these green jobsPresident Obama has held three public events in recent days tohighlight his concern about the economy and the need to create jobsYesterday the administration apparently announced billions more in taxcredits for renewable energy and energy conservation efforts I willbet when I look at that list I am going to support most of thosebecause I believe a national energy policy involves capturing whateverwe can of petroleum and fossil fuels we have available for a shortperiod of time because we are never going to get rid of them in theshort term We need conservation and we need renewable and alternativeenergy Those three things make a comprehensive energy programObviously if I am for that comprehensive energy program I am forrenewable energy and alternative energyIt seems as if nearly everyone in fact in the administration istouting the benefits of green jobs and a clean energy economy and I amdoing that right now myself It is astonishing though with all thistalk about green jobs and clean energy that this Congress right nowseems to be heading for the holidays while thousands of green energyworkers will receive pink slips and furloughsOn December 31 of this year the current biodiesel tax credit willexpire The biodiesel tax credit provides a 1pergallon credit forbiodiesel made from soybean oil and yellow grease and animal fats Thetax credit is essential in maintaining the competitiveness of thiscleanburning domestically produced green fuel and the jobs that areconnected with itThe tax credit exists for a commonsense reason and something we havebeen using for a long period of time to offset the higher cost ofproducing biodieselor I could just as well insert the wordethanolcompared to petroleum diesel Without the tax creditpetroleum marketers will be unwilling to purchase the more expensivebiodiesel and demand will vanish From this standpoint of the taxcredit I hope everybody remembers that whether it is wind ethanolsolar biodiesel biomass or geothermal it takes tax credits to getthese programs off the ground Right now wind energy is a big industryin my State not only from the production standpoint but from thestandpoint of manufacturing of components because in 1992 I got awind energy tax credit passed otherwise we would not have wind energyand everybody touts wind energy today It is a little bit like the veryinfant biodiesel industry we have One might not think biofuels are aninfant industry because ethanol has been around for 30 years butbiodiesel is about where ethanol was 30 years ago So we want to helpmove this industry along so eventually it can stand on its own legsThat is the motive behind all these tax credits to get an infantindustry started and then they stand on their ownIn 2008 getting back to the jobs in this industry biodieselsupported 51000 green jobs Because of the downturn in the economy andthe credit crisis the biodiesel industry has already shed 29000 greenjobs So now what about the rest of those jobs That is what my remarksare all about and that is what getting the tax credit renewed beforethe end of the year is all about Because the industry is currentlyoperating at just around 15 percent of capacity Without an extensionof the tax credit all US biodiesel production will grind to a haltPlants will be shuttered and workers will be let goNo one should be surprised by the upcoming expiration of this taxcredit It was extended most recently in October 2008 So we have knownfor 14 months hence nobody should be surprised that it would need tobe extended by the end of this yearThe Senate has been in session nearly continuously for monthsEarlier this year Senator Cantwell and I introduced a bill to extendthe tax credit for 5 years and change it to a production tax creditThere is no excuse for inaction on this credit The Democraticleadership is content to leave without doing the necessary work onextenders believing they can extend the tax provisions retroactivelysometime early next year Retroactivity does work a lot of times on taxextenders that are not extended at the end of the year and extended tobe made retroactive But retroactivity in the case of the biodieselmarket doesnt help bring it from grinding to a halt on January 12010 because without the incentive the biodiesel will cost much morethan petroleum dieselWhile the House and Senate dither thousands will lose their jobsbut demand for dirty imported petroleum diesel however willcontinue Investments in the domestic renewable fuels industry willlose value and possibly disappearquite to the contrary of what I saidin my remarks of yesterday the President announcing various taxcredits So this one has been on the books All it has to be isreauthorizedIt is too bad that among all the talk of green jobs and the cleanenergy economy Congress is unable to pass a simple extension of anexisting tax credit Once

H_IL_SHIMKUS,2009-12-08, Thankyou for letting me join you  Andas you know Im from the coalfields of southern Illinois and I spentthis whole year and last year fighting for our coal reserves and theimportance of that And I usually bring another poster of miners wholost their jobs during the last cycle 1200 miners in one mine TheState of Ohio lost 35000 coal miner jobs That is just a fraction ofwhat we will see in this country if we roll back the carbon emissionsand if they could prove it but they cant  And that is whatAdministrator Jackson just said I think what is important Mr Barton was your focus on science andyour focus on data points and what we should be able to do in theChamber in a bipartisan manner is to agree on the data points Weshould be able to agree on what the science is and thats in questionAnd for many of us it has been in question for a long timeWere joined by John Linder whos been following this as long asanyone else has and part of his search has been because the scientistswould not give the data They would never tell us whats the base bywhich theyre making this extrapolation And so Im glad that youhighlighted the scientific method that I didnt get on the chart but Ibrought down hereIts very simple I taught high school Youre an engineer I went toan engineering school This is irrefutable This is how science isdone You ask questions You do background research Backgroundresearch in this debate would be to get the temperaturesWere already questioning the background research one based uponthe request from the Freedom of Information Act and of course now ourfriends at the IPCC are saying We dont have them The dog ate thehomework It is amazing Scientists are really some of the mostrespected professionals But theyre respected because of this thisprocess which should be objective You should be able to follow itYou should be able to construct a hypothesis The hypothesis is aneducated guess That is all it is Its not truth Its a guess basedupon the data points And then you arethen youre to test it Andthen you analyze the result and then draw your conclusionsBased upon the scientific method you can categorically say right nowthat those who say the science that solves are in error The sciencedoes not solve That is why all of this political activity is going onright now That is why now the EPA administrator is saying Were goingto do endangerment findings They want to do it before we are able toeducate the public that the science is not solid And they are notproviding us with the data points theyre not complying with Freedomof Information Act requests And so this process is skewedSo when they tested it they found out that the results didnt matchtheir educated guess And what did they do These scientists arepoliticians They went intowe call it in the military they went andholed up They lowered the turrets they got under ground Dont askquestions And here are some of the emails in essence to prove thatHeres the first oneThe fact is that we cant account for the lack of warming at themoment and it is a travesty that we cant   As of 2 months ago we cant account for the lack ofwarmingTheres two things here First of all they say we cant account forthe lack of warming So their background research he is already tryingto skew the research And he has an emotional response Its a shameIm saddened Scientists shouldnt be emotionally attached to thedata This is the data Lets test itWhat we would encourage our friends on the other side to say is in abipartisan manner lets get the facts on the table and lets get thescientists to look at the facts The facts are being hidden That issadOne is they dont have the facts two is hes emotionally distraughtbecause his hypotheses cannot be provenHeres another one to the ranking member I cant see either ofthese papers being in the next International Panel on Climate Changereport Kevin and I will keep them out somehoweven if we have toredefine what the peerreview literature isHeres another process on the scientific message Analyze theresults Draw conclusions They have got sometheyve done someanalysis that doesnt support it So are they going to add that in ascientific objective fashion say This is what we believe but thereare some who disagreethey say that the facts dont speak for thehypotheses No These scientists say Were going to bury it Weregoing to hide it We dont want the public to knowCan you imagine scientists doing thatAgain the scientific community is one of the most respectedcommunities because they go by the scientific methodHere they admit that theyre going to keep the analyses out of thereporttwo analyses that contradict what they want their hypothesis tobe   And theres the followup Are they receiving taxpayer dollars topromote this theory through the IPCC which is the UN InternationalPanel on Climate Change or Virginiaedu and you could speculate thatthere are DOE grants EPA money going And another thing thesescientists are for hire Theyre for hire   I believe that those who seek taxpayer dollarswe knowhere that agencies and programs never go away If thats why theyrenot providing the data thats why theyre hiding the fact of the lastdecadecan you imagine us in this environment of trying to get controlof the deficit and the debt and were spending billions of dollars toscientists who are not using the scientific method  They want to keep theirjobs so theyre continuing to promote and deceive the public I dontknow I would say its pretty damaging to their name to the communityand also to the taxpayersNow if I may I have one more that Id like to share And there aretons I mean these are just a small sampling The ones I picked out Ikind of wanted to address the scientific methodAgain as an engineer give us the facts give us the data test thedata prove if its right or wrong If its wrong get an analysis andthen maybe try again Retest it Lets retest the data pointHere is another one Ive just completed Mikes Nature trick ofadding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years iefrom 1981 onwards 20 years for Keith to hide the declineSo now not only are they not providing the data they are keepingthe analysis from being reported in the IPCC report and they arejimmying the numbers They are actually using tricksThese are scientists Now we are politicians I think people wouldhave some skepticism We dont claim to beyou claim to be anengineer I went to engineering school I understand it but if youwere building a bridge or if you were designing a building and youjimmied the numbers on the tensile strength of the steel you would bein real trouble because the design would be faulty and the buildingwould collapseTheir design Administrator Jacksons design to remake the UnitedStates is on faulty data It is on data that has been jimmied And thishouse of cards will collapse and it will be jobs in the wake on faultydataNow bring us real data Go through the scientific method Test itbut dont hide it Dont trick us Dont deceive us Dont discourageyour profession of scientists by staying on the public dole to receivetaxpayer money to continue to promote a fraud a fraud on the Americanpublic So thats why I real appreciate Congressman Barton thatyouve taken this time to help address this Theres a lot ofeducation And this education has to go on now because they are goingto be making decisions in Copenhagen They are going to try to bind usto stuff on faulty data  The International Panel on ClimateChange they are the UN designees to continue to provide theinformation to the folks who attend the conference upon which they makethe decisions 
S_NH_GREGG,2009-12-10, Will the Senator yield for a question on that point  I certainly respect that the Senator from Montana workedvery hard to have a bipartisan initiative here but this bill we aredealing with has no bipartisanship to it at all Was this not writtenin camera behind closed doors for 8 weeks by the majority leader Wasthere a Republican in that room at any time And we have now been on itfor what 8 days or something while they wrote it for 8 weeks Andfurthermore is there not rumored to be floating around this Congresssomewhere in some room againthat we have not been invited toamajor rewrite of this bill called the managers amendment whichsupposedly is going to expand coverage to people under Medicare to 55years of age with Medicare already being bankrupt and already cannotafford the people they have on Medicare It is going to expand it Wehave not seen it Yet this is going to change this bill fundamentallyand change health care fundamentallyIs that bipartisan I ask the Senator from Wyoming if that is thecase Was this bill written in a bipartisan manner Were anyRepublicans in the room Did it go through a committee process Was itamended Did it not take 8 weeks to write it and it has now been onthe floor for 8 days and all of our amendments are being pushed to theside And are we not hearing about a massivea massiverewrite ofthis bill that is going to appear deus ex machina from the majorityleaders office and fundamentally change the way health care isdelivered in this country Is that going to be bipartisan The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Bennet The Senator from New Hampshire On that last point it does seem there is a slowdownoccurring on amendments As I understand it we have four or five verysubstantive amendments dealing with taxes dealing with employermandates that we are ready to go to and we are ready to vote on isthat not correct  I hope at some point today maybe we should propound aunanimous consent setting those four items up for votes on Saturday andSunday  President I would ask is the Senator from NorthDakota recognized under an order of a colloquy at this point President I ask unanimous consent that we have 20minutes equally divided between myself and the Senator from NorthDakota at this time I see the Senator from Connecticut obviouslywishes to speak also  Do we have time remaining on our side  President I am privileged to join the Senator fromSouth Dakota the chairman of the Budget Committee on this initiativeWe have worked on it for a while and we have come to a position ofhaving a piece of legislation that accomplishes the goal as outlined bythe Senator from North Dakota That is good newsThe outpouring of support in the Senateover 31 cosponsors in just abrief period of timeis a sign that there is a willingness to move ina bipartisan way That is good newsRight now for this country after the possibility of a terroristgetting a weapon of mass destruction and using it against us in theUnited States the single biggest threat we have as a nation is thefact that we are on course toward fiscal insolvency You cannot getaround it If we continue on the present course this Nation goesbankrupt We are already seeing the early signs of it The early signsare devastating enough We are seeing some of the nations who lend tousand remember we are a debtor nation now of massive proportionssaying Hold on you folks are not being responsible especially aboutyour outyear debtTwo days ago we saw one of the rating agencies Moodys say Englandand the United States now are going to be put into a special categoryrelative to the rest of the industrialized world because their fiscalsituation is in such risk and they are not managing their fiscal housecorrectlyWe know as the Senator from North Dakota has outlined so correctlythat within 10 yearsmaybe soonerwe aregoing to get to a point where our debt has gotten so large we simplycannot pay it or if we have to pay it we are going to have to do someextraordinary things to do that such as inflating the currency orraising taxes to a level where we reduce productivity and theopportunity for jobs It is akin to a dog chasing its tail when you getyour debt to a certain level When you have spent so much more than youhave taken in and you have promised so much more than you can afford topay and your debt gets to such a level as a nation you only have twochoices You inflate the currency and destroy the quality of peopleslives destroying the value of their savings and you put in aninflation economy which is one of the worst things that can everhappen to a country or you have to radically increase your tax burdento levels that are simply going to choke off the capacity of the Nationto create prosperity because people will not be able to be productiveYou will start to lose tax revenues as a result of thatThis is not a theoretical case This is no longer something that isover the horizon This problem is directly in front of us We arehearing it from the people who lend us money from the rating agenciesand we know it from intuitive common sense Most Americans know this isan extraordinary problemWe talked about this for a long time and we worked on it for a longtime Yes regular order should take care of this but we know it willnot because we have seen what happens When you put an idea on thetable to deal with major entitlement programs that affect so manypeople in such a personal way immediately those ideas are attackedand savaged misrepresented exploited exaggerated and hyperbolizedby the interest groups that populate this city and other parts of thecountry for the purpose of making their political agenda move forwardor their moneyraising formula move forwardWhen substantive good ideas have been put on the table to try tocorrect this fiscal imbalance by dealing with questions of SocialSecurity and Medicare or tax policy we get clobbered on the policyside We came to the conclusion from the right and the left that it isequally outrageous and equally destructive of constructive publicpolicy We came to the conclusion that the only way you can do this isto create a process that drives the policy rather than put the policyon the table first saying here is the policy and everybody jumps on itand kicks it and screams at it and so it never even gets to thestarting line We decided lets get to a process that leads to policyand leads to an absolute voteThe theory is basically threefold One the process has to beabsolutely fair and bipartisan Nobody can feel they are being gamedThe American people will not allow major policy to occur in these areasunless they are comfortable the policy is bipartisan and fair So thisprocess we have set up is a bipartisan affair There will be 18 peopleWe decided to go with people who actually have a responsibility formaking decisions and understand the issues intimately 16 from theCongress as was mentioned8 Republicans and 8 Democratsand the 2from the administration with a supermajority to meet to report andthere will be cochairmen from each party That gives us the bipartisannatureThe second part that is critical to the exercise is that it be realand that it not end up being a game We have seen so many commissionsend up being just commissions They put their report out and it ends upon a shelf somewhereSomething has to happen What happens is when this Commissionreports with a supermajority and comes to Congress by supermajority itmust be voted up or down So there is an absolute right to a vote andthe vote occurs on the policies proposed That is critical It is muchalong the lines of what we did for base closures for many of the samereasons You couldnt close bases politically so we did it by fasttrack approvalThird there will be no amendments Why Amendments allow Members tohide in the corners It is that simple Somebody throws an amendmentupeven if it is well intentionedand people vote for the amendmentand then say it didnt pass or I will not vote for the final productYou have to have a policy put forward and it will either attract abipartisan supermajority and be a fair policy or it is not If itdoesnt attract a bipartisan supermajority clearly it wasnt wellthought outThat is the process we have come to The amount of sponsors we havereflects the fact that it is viable and that it is bipartisan We have12 Democratic sponsors already and 19 Republicans What else aroundhere has that with serious legislation This is itI congratulate the Senator from North Dakota for his efforts I amhopeful we can get a vote on it Then I hope it can pass and I amhopeful we can get White House support and House support to do thisWe are running out of time If we dont accomplish this fairly soonthe outcome is very simple We will pass on to our children lessopportunity a lower standard of living and a weaker Nation than wereceived from our parents No generation in American history has donethat But that is what we are going to do if we dont take action Thatis exactly what is going to happen How can one generation do that toanother In American history that has never happened This is anopportunity to avoid having that occur or at least help avoid it Ihope it will move forwardI reserve the remainder of my time
S_KS_BROWNBACK,2009-12-11, President I am delighted to follow my colleaguefrom Utah I am pleased he has raised these constitutional issueswhich I think are significant to this bill The idea that we could havea constitutional mandate to buy health insurance to me is highlyquestionable under our rights under the role of the Federal Governmentand under the Constitution Senator Hatch has been on the JudiciaryCommittee for many years and he understands these issues very wellWe are now on our sixth iteration of the health care reform billThis one talks about expanding Medicare basically as one of the keycomponents of solving the problem Here is a quote from the Mayo ClinicI found and others have also been cited I found this interestingsuccinct and accurateAny plan to expand Medicare which is the Governmentslargest public plan beyond its current scope does not solvethe Nations health care crisis but compounds it It is alsoclear that an expansion of the price control of the Medicarepayment system will not control overall Medicare spending orcurb costs This scenario follows the typical pattern forprice control reduced access compromised quality andincreasing costs anyway We need to address these problemsnot perpetuate them through health reform legislationThat was the Mayo Clinic It is clearly not the way to go to solvethe crisis or the problems It probably hastens the day Medicare goesbankrupt which is set to happen in 2017 7 years awayI want to talk about the possibility that this health care bill putsthis very early piece of economic recovery that we are having at riskThe latest reports on unemployment provide some hope that our batteredeconomy may be showing some tentative signs of economic recovery asthe job loss continues to slow Most of this is based off of monetarypolicy We are seeing some of this taking placeConsumer confidence is still low Unemployment hovers at 10 percentand over 7 million jobs were lost since the beginning of the recessionIt should be clear that any potential recovery is incredibly fragileThat being the case Congress and the administration should focus likea laser beam on policies that encourage economic growth and putAmericans back to work That seems to be obviousInstead though the administration and the DemocraticcontrolledCongress have taken up crucial months with a proposed revamping of ourentire health care system that will cost nearly 25 trillion over thenext 10 years to be paid for by new taxes and employer mandates andit will impose a grave risk to a sustained rebound of our Nationseconomy This hurts our economic recoveryNot only that but the Democratic health care bill includes somepositively perverse incentives that would discourage hiring worksaving and even marriage Again it would discourage hiring worksavings and marriage Higher taxes more employer mandates anddisincentives to job creation productivity and family formation arehardly the prescription for the growth our economy so desperately needsright nowBoth the House and the Senate bills would for instance increase thealready existing penalty on work faced by many lowincome families whoreceive tax and inkind benefits from government welfare programs Wealready heard this Health insurance subsidies in the legislation forindividuals and families in poverty would tack on an additional 12 to20 percent to marginal tax rates which already approach 40 to 50percent for families receiving a variety of benefits for those with lowincomes This would result in marginal tax rates of 50 to 60 percentfor most affected familiesIf working more hours or obtaining better paying jobs results in morethan half of those additional earnings being taken away as a result oftaxes or a reduction in benefitsif you are a lowincome individualyou are working more you are getting more money coming in but yourbenefits from the government are reduced So if you are taking 50 to 60percent away in a reduction of benefits or in taxes the incentive towork harder or to invest in an education is greatly reduced That isobvious on its face Yet it is in this billThis is not the only work disincentive in the bill It is common forteenagers and college students to obtain jobs so they can have somespending money on their own or to help with their educational expensesThe Senate bill penalizes the families of these younger workers byincluding their wages in benefit eligibility calculations For manylowtomoderate income families the inclusion of their wages couldmean a significant increase in their cost of health insurance or evenin them losing thousands of dollars of health insurance subsidiesaltogether That is in the billAnd more harmful to the economy potentially are the incentivesdirected at employers Both the House and Senate bills includetemporary subsidies to small businesses to encourage them to offeremployersponsored health insurance As the number of employeesincrease or as salaries increase the amount of the credit provided tothe business decreases The structure of this subsidy not onlydiscourages employers from hiring new employees but it alsodiscourages them from increasing employees salaries We dont wantthose sorts of disincentives in any billIronically the incentives in the bill would even work to encourageemployers to drop health insurance coverage for individual employees oreliminate insurance coverage altogether The Senate bill would capemployee contributions to insurance premiums at 98 percent of theirincome If an employeroffered a policy that required employees to pay more than this theemployee would be eligible to purchase insurance through the newhealth care exchanges The employer would have to pay a fineSince in many cases that fine is considerably less than theadditional insurance costs the employer would incur if they retainedcoverage many businesses concerned about the bottom line would beenticed by the bill to stop providing any health insurance coverage Sothey are actually enticed here to drop health insurance coverageanother thing we dont want to see happenFurthermore employers who offer flexible spending accounts or FSAswill be encouraged to stop providing these taxfree medical spendingaccounts for their employees Under the Senate Democrats bill FSAcontributions will be included in the total cost of employees healthinsurance benefits for the purpose of calculating the proposed tax onhighcost health plansthe socalled Cadillac health care plansAdding an FSA contribution could push the total cost of health benefitsabove the highcost threshold for many workers which will result inthe employer being liable for a portion of the 40 percent highcostplans tax As more and more plans become subject to the highcostplans tax it will be in the employers best interest to eliminate FSAofferings altogether That is another disincentive we dont want to seehappeningThe proposed legislation would also create new marriage penaltiesacross the income spectrum We have been working for some years to doaway with the marriage penalty Marriage is a good and solidinstitution that helps so much in this Nation Yet it puts in amarriage penalty penalizes people for getting married it is builtinto this legislation These penalties can be so large that in somecases couples would have to forgo marriage in order to avoid thousandsof dollars in new taxes The penalties are significant Low andmoderateincome families often have limited savings as well Given thealready significant marriage penalties in lowincome benefit programsit seems ironic that the government would create yet another programthat penalizes lowincome individuals for getting marriedCurrently if they are on public assistance and they get marriedtheir combined incomes often move a couple out of the support theyreceive for their families whether it is health support housing orfood support By getting married they often lose their benefitsInstead of taking them away we ought to be helping them form solidfamilies That sort of disincentive is built into this health insuranceplan as well where you actually put in disincentives for lowincomecouples to get married In other words to be able to get the healthinsurance subsidy they may have to forgo marriage That is not thesort of incentive we want in the system and in the bill We are tryingto take it away in the welfare programs but to add another piece tolow and moderateincome couples is the wrong way for us to goThat the Democratic health care legislation would set the UnitedStates on a path to a singlepayer governmentrun health insurancesystem of the sort found in Europe and Canada is bad enough but evenmore troubling is the fact that these proposals would create a seriesof perverse incentives ultimately harmful to workers businesses andthe entire economy The Senate must reject this poorly conceivedruinously expensive scheme and get back to the business of helping oureconomy recoverI have talked to many people across the United States andparticularly in Kansas many people who are deeply concerned about thiseconomy and the perverse things coming out of Washington While theymight start considering investing in their small business putting someincome or something out to be able to grow and create jobs people areholding back and saying I dont know how many more taxes you will puton us or what the health insurance plan will look like I dont knowwhat cap and trade will do on raising energy costsThey are holding back These perverse economic signals and thediscussion of them in Washington is perversely affecting the economyIt is hurting the economic recovery If you put these pieces into placestatutorily you are hurting savings hurting hiring hurting marriageformation and you will further hurt an already very tentative recoveryfrom taking placeThis is a bad medicine for the economy The idea that you wouldexpand Medicare to take care of that is a terrible idea You will behurting a program that already is not financially solvent in the longterm and is looking at something like 30 trillion of unfundedobligations already on its books That alone if you expand it back toage 55 plus the provider communitythe American Medical Associationand the American Hospital Association are opposed to this expansion ofMedicare They dont get full reimbursement of costs right now Withthe talk about bringing it back to age 55 you will be sweeping a largenumber of people into Medicare so you are sweeping in a lot of peoplewho are already in private insurance plans When they are pulled out ofprivate insurance which pays at the full rate to the providercommunity you are taking those resources away from the providercommunity from doctors and hospitals That is why you are seeing theAmerican Medical Association and the American Hospital Association comeout against this proposal on Medicare expansion How on Earth would itever be paid for when the program is already not on a stable financialtrackThe Federation of American Hospitals stated thisThe FAH is strongly opposed to this proposal A Medicarebuyin would involve Medicare rates would be controlled byCMS and would crowd out older workers with private coverageand may choose early retirement as a result Such a policywill further negatively impact hospitalsIn my rural State in particular it would have a huge negativeimpact on a number of the hospitals in my StateMr President I yield the floor
S_ND_DORGAN,2009-12-15, President did the Senator object  If thisis Groundhog Day for pharmaceutical drugs the clock strikes 6 andthe pharmaceutical industry wins They have been doing it for 10 yearsWe just repeat the day over and over again My hope is that we will nothave to repeat it today My hope is that after a lot of work on abipartisan piece of legislation the American people will havesufficient support on the floor of the Senate to say it is not fair forus to be paying double triple and 10 times the cost of prescriptiondrugs that others in the world are payingI wonder if we might be able to yield some time to the Senator fromIowa 5 minutes unless the Senator from Arizona wishes to conclude  President I yield myself such time as I may consumeunder the hour I controlWe are going to have people trotting onto the floor of the Senatethis afternoonand some have this morningtalking about this issue ofprescription drug reimportation and saying there are safety problemswith itsafety problems I wish to talk about one small piece ofhealth care reform without which you cant call it health care reformbecause at least with respect to the issue of pricing of prescriptiondrugs there will be no reform unless my amendment is passedMy amendment is bipartisan It includes support from Senator SnoweSenator MCCain Senator Grassley on that side and many DemocraticSenators as well and it says Lets put the brakes on theseunbelievable increases in the price of prescription drugs a 9percentincrease this year alone in brandname prescription drugsWhy is this an important issue How about lets talk about the priceof Nexiumthe price of Nexium You buy it if you need it 424 for anequivalent quantity in the United States If you want to buy itelsewhere not 424 you pay 37 in Germany 36 in Spain 41 in GreatBritain We are charged the highest prices in the world forprescription drugsWe are going to have a lot of people come out and say Well therewill be safety problems if we reimport FDAapproved drugs from othercountriesabsolute rubbishHere is Dr Rost a former vice president for marketing for PfizerCorporation and this is what he saidDuring my time I was responsible for a region in northernEurope I never oncenot onceheard the drug industryregulatory agencies the government or anyone else sayingthat this practice was unsafe Personally I think it isoutright derogatory to claim that Americans would not be ableto handle reimportation of drugs when the rest of theeducated world can do itThey have been doing this in Europe for 20 years reimporting lowerpriced prescription drugs from other countries and they do it safelyOur consumers pay the highest prices in the world because there is nocompetition for prescription drugs When a drug is sold for a fractionof the price elsewhereonetenth the price for Nexium in Germany andGreat Britainthe American people cant access it Even though it ismade in the same plant the same pill put in the same bottle theAmerican people are told It is offlimits to youDr Rost also said this Right now drug companies are testifyingthat imported drugs are unsafe Nothing could be further from thetruth This from a former executive of Pfizer CorporationWhen the pharmaceutical industry goes around the Hill today and tellsyou that importing medicine is going to be unsafeand by the way ourbill only allows the importation from Australia New Zealand Japanand the European countries where they have an identical chain ofcustody and where we require pedigree and we require batch lots thatwill make the entire drug supply much safer including the domesticdrug supplywhen the pharmaceutical industry goes around the Hilltoday saying If you vote for the DorganSnoweMCCain et alamendment you are voting for less safety ask the pharmaceuticalindustry this What about the fact that you get 40 percent of youractive ingredients for drugs from India and China and from places inIndia and China in many circumstances that have never been investigatedor inspected by anyone Answer that and then tell us that reimportingFDAapproved prescription drugs from other countries is unsafe What abunch of rubbishMy understanding is sometime yesterdaymaybe late last nightsomebody made a deal I dont know what the deal is but I guess thedeal is to say we are going to have this amendmentit has been 7 dayssince we started debating this amendmentwe are going to have thisamendment vote and then we are going to have another vote on anotheramendment that nullifies it It is the amendment I call I stand up forthe American people paying the highest prices in the world forprescription drugsIf you want to support that amendment go right ahead What you aredoing is nullifying any ability of the American people to have thefreedom to access lower priced drugs where they are sold elsewhere inthe world I am talking about FDAapproved drugs made in FDAapprovedplants It doesnt matter what the fancy wrapping and the brightribbons are on this packageThis package to nullify what we are trying to do is a package thatcomes directly from the pharmaceutical industry Why To protect theirinterests This year they will sell 290 billion worth of drugs 80percent brandname prescription drugs On brandname drugs the priceincreased 9 percent this year and on generic drugs it fell by 9percent Now I understand why they want to protect those interestsHere are two pill bottles both contain Lipitor both made in a plantin Ireland by an American corporation This sent to Canada this sentto the United States The American consumer gets the same pill made inthe same bottle made in the same plant by the same company TheAmerican consumer also gets the privilege of paying nearly triple theprice and cant do a thing about it because this Congress vote aftervote after vote has said We stand with the pharmaceutical industryand against competition and against freedom for the American workerIf I sound a bit sick and tired of it I am We have been going afterthis for 8 to 10 years to give the American people the freedom toaccess the identical FDAapproved drugs for a fraction of the pricewhere they are sold everywhere else in the world and we are told againand again and again there is this phony excuse about safety completelyphonyI will have more to say about it later but I did want to say we aregoing to see a lot of people trotting out here with such a shopworntired pathetic argument to try to keep things as they are and try tokeep saying to the American people You pay the highest prices in theworld for brandname drugs and that is OK That is the way we are goingto leave it We will call it health care reform and at the end of theday that is what you end up with The highest prices in the world a9percent increase just this year alone Over the next 10 years that9percent increase just this year nets the pharmaceutical industry220 billion but that is OK That is the way you are going to end upAmerican consumer because we dont want to give you the freedom toaccess those lower priced drugs where they are sold for a fraction ofthe priceOne final point I have mentioned often an old codger who sat on astraw bale at a farm once where I had a meeting and he said I am 80years old Every 3 months we have to drive to Canada across the borderbecause my wife has been fighting breast cancer Why do we drive toCanada To buy Tamoxifen Why do we have to go there to buy it WepaidI think he saidonetenth the price in Canada We couldnt have afforded it otherwiseIs that what we want the American people to have to do Most peoplecant drive across the border someplace Why not establish a systemlike they have had in Europe for 20 years to allow the American peoplethe freedom to access reasonably priced drugs FDAapproved drugsSo this is a day in which we will vote on my amendment and then wewill vote on an amendment that nullifies it and we will see whetherenough of a deal has been made so the fix is in So once again theAmerican people end this day having to pay the highest prices in theworld Pay pay pay pay soak the American consumer keep doing itThat has been the message here for 10 yearsA group of us Republicans and Democrats 30 who have cosponsoredthis legislation have said you know what We are sick and tired ofit Give the American people the freedom If this is a global economyhow about a global economy for real people How about let them have theadvantages of a global economyOnce again I will have a lot more to say this afternoon It isapparently a day for dealmaking and we will see who made what dealsbut we are going to have votes I know one thing I know thepharmaceutical industry has a lot of clout I know that I hope theAmerican people have the ability to expect some clout on their behalfin the Chamber of the Senate this afternoonI yield the floor and I make a point of order that a quorum is notpresent President I ask unanimous consent that the order forthe quorum call be rescinded President my understanding is there is a desire bysome to have a quorum call in which the quorum call time is chargedagainst all sides My understanding is there are I think 5 hoursallocated with respect to today 1 hour for the Baucus amendment 1hour for the Crapo amendment and 3 hours distributed as follows 1hour for me 1 more Mr Lautenberg and 1 hour for the Republicanleader on the prescription drug reimportation am I correct So I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call beallocated against the 4 hours and not against the hour I control  President my understanding is I will put in a quorumcall the time is equally divided apparently between the sides in acircumstance where the other side has 3 hours and our side has 2 hoursand especially on the subject I have just discussed the other side has2 hours and I have 1 hourI will put us into a quorum call and I guess it will be equallydivided between the two sidesI suggest the absence of a quorumThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Carper Is there objectionWithout objection it is so orderedThe clerk will call the rollThe bill clerk proceeded to call the roll  I would say to the Senator from Alaska theseprescription drugs would be able to be reimported from Australia NewZealand Japan and the European countries that have identical chainsof custody to our chain of custody so that there is safetyIt is also the case that we are in politics so the floor of theSenate is the place of a lot of tall tales I understand that I havebeen in politics for a long time  I know mycolleague from Arizona wishes to engage in a brief colloquy on thispoint The amendment we are offering a bipartisan amendment dealingwith the price of prescription drugs is a very important amendment Weare going to get our vote on that but then there is also going to be avote on a poison pill amendment that nullifies it It says if you passthe second amendment it means nothing happens and prescription drugprices keep going through the roofI wish to say quickly there have been very few bipartisan amendmentson the floor of the Senate during this health care debate That isregrettable This in fact is bipartisan A wide range of 30 Senatorsincluding Republicans John MCCain Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe andso on support this effort and the effort is simple trying to put thebrakes on prescription drug prices by giving the American peoplefreedom and the ability to find competition among drug prices wherethey are sold in other parts of the world for a fraction of what we arecharged as American consumers  We have been working on this for 10 yearsmyself theSenator from Arizona and others He knows because he was chairman ofthe Commerce Committee We held hearings on this in the committee Thefact is we have gotten votes on it before In each case thepharmaceutical industry which has a lot of muscle around hereprevailed on those votes with an amendment that is a poison pillamendment saying somebody has to certify with respect to no additionalsafety risk and so onThese safety issues are completely bogus absolutely bogus They havedone in Europe for 20 years what we are proposing to do in thiscountry parallel trading between countries What we are trying to dois save the American people 100 billion in the next 10 years becausewe are charged the highest prices in the world for prescription drugsand there is no justification for itI want to show the Senator from Arizona one chart This isrepresentative If you happen to take Nexium for the same quantity youpay 424 in the United States if you were in Spain you would pay 36France 67 Great Britain 41 Germany 37 Why is it the Americanconsumer has the privilege of paying 10 times the cost for exactly thesame drug put in the same bottle made by the same company in the sameplant Justify that  The President was a cosponsor of thislegislation when he served last year I dowant to say as well the American consumer gets to pay 10 times the costfor Nexium Nexium is for acid reflux probably a condition that willexist with some after this vote because my understanding is after 7days on the floor of the Senate there is now an arrangement by whichthe pharmaceutical industry will probably have sufficient votes to beatus once again which means the American people loseI also want to make this point Anyone who stands up and cites safetyand reads the stuff that has come out of a copying machine for 10years understand this Dr Peter Rost former vice president ofmarketing for Pfizer formerly worked in Europe on the parallel tradingsystem saidThe biggest argument against reimportation is safety Whateveryone has conveniently forgotten to tell you is that inEurope reimportation of drugs has been in place for 20 yearsIt is an insult to the American people to say You can make this workin Europe for the benefit of consumers to get lower prices butAmericans dont have the capability to make this happen dont have thecapability to manage it That is absurd This safety issue isunbelievably bogus  President I yield 5 minutes to the Senator fromIowaThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Kaufman The Senator from Iowa  President I ask the Senator to withhold his requestfor a quorum President back in the mid1800s when Lincoln andDouglas were having their famous debates at one point Lincoln wasexasperated because he could not get Douglas to understand something hewas saying He said to Douglas Listen how many legs does a horsehave Douglas said Four of course Lincoln said If you call the taila leg how many legs would he have Douglas said Five Lincoln saidThere is where you are wrong Simply calling a tail a leg doesnt makeit a leg at allYes that is exactly what my colleagues have done suggesting theamendment we are offering is for untested unregulated drugs It is nottrue The only drugs we are talking about are FDAapproved drugs thatare made at an FDAinspected plant part of a chain of custody equal tothe US chain of custody It is simply not true that we are talkingabout untested unregulated drugs That is not true Simply saying thatdoesnt make it trueHere is why we are on the floor of the Senate We are reforminghealth care That is what the bill is Part of health care isprescription drugs A lot of people take prescription drugs to keepthem out of a hospital bed It manages their disease Prescriptiondrugs are very importantHere is what happened to the prices year after year As you can seeon this chart the rate of inflation is in yellow and the prescriptiondrug prices are in red This year alone it is up 9 percent at a timewhen inflation is below zeroWell why do we want to be able to access the same FDAapproved drugwhere it is sold elsewhere at a fraction of the price Because theAmerican people will pay in the next decadeif we dont pass thislegislation100 billion in excess prescription drug prices If youneed to take Nexium for acid refluxmaybe after this vote we will allneed it But if you are going to buy Nexium it costs 424 for anequivalent quantity in the United States You can buy it for 41 in theUK 36 in Spainbut it is 424 here Sound fair Not to meLipitor is the most popular cholesterollowering drug in the worldIt is 125 in the United States for an equivalent quantity You get thesame thing for 40 in the UK or onethird of the price It is 32 inSpain onefourth the price It is 33 in Canada The American peopleget to pay triple or quadruple the price By the way it comes in thesebottles I ask unanimous consent to use the bottles They both contained Lipitor that is made in Ireland by anAmerican corporation They have different colored labels but they aremade in the same plant FDA approved and they are sent to differentplacesthis one to Canada and this one to the United States But wehave the privilege of paying triple the price Sound fair Not to me itdoesntHere is a sample Boniva for osteoporosis is up 18 percent thisyear Singulair for asthma is up 12 percent Enbrel for arthritisis up 12 percent Here is Plavixthe list goes onThe question is Is there something we ought to do about this orshould we say lets pass health care reform and ignore what ishappening to the price of prescription drugs This amendment I offeredalong with Senators MCCain and Grassley and other colleagues on thisside30 cosponsorsis all about freedom for the American people Ifthis is a global economy how about giving the American people thefreedom to access identical prescription drugs which we know areidentical because we require safety if it doesnt even exist in our ownsupply Those who talk about safety I remind them 40 percent of theactive ingredients in prescription drugs of the United States come fromIndia and Chinafrom places that have never been inspectedThe Wall Street Journal did terrific expose about this There wereover 60 people who died from Heparin in this country It wascontaminated Here is where they were making it This picture was inthe investigation Here is a rusty old pot being stirred with a limbfrom a tree Those are active ingredients for American drugs This guyis working with pig intestinesguts from a hog This old man herewith a wooden stickit looks unsanitary doesnt it That is the sourceof Heparin These are the photographs by the Wall Street Journalinvestigative reporter They are telling us FDAapproved drugs comingfrom other countries with a chain of custody identical to ours wouldpose some sort of threat Are you kidding You can make that chargewithout laughing out loudLets talk about the existing drug supply for a moment This is ayoung man named Tim Fagan He was a victim of counterfeit domesticdrugs in this countrynot imported FDAapproved drugs Do you knowwhere this guys drug came from Here is the report done on that It ismade by Amgen It went through all these places It ended up at a placecalled Playpen which is a south Florida strip clubin a cooler in theback room of a south Florida strip club At one point it was stored incar trunks Finally it was prescribed and administered to this youngman named Tim Fagan He survived but he was getting medicine with onetwentieth the necessary strength for a serious disease that his doctorintended for himDont talk to me about the issue of prescription drug safety We aretalking about safety that doesnt now exist in the domestic drugsupply but safety standards are included in this amendment Every drugshould have a pedigree to track where it came from and in everyrespect between manufacture and consumption There ought to be batchlots and tracers for every drug There ought to be pedigree for thedomestic drug supply as wellI wish to quote a former vice president of Pfizer Corporation aprescription drug manufacturer Dr Peter RostRight now drug companies are testifying that importeddrugs are unsafe Nothing could be further from the truthThis is from a vice president of one of the major drug companiesnothing can be further from the truth He was fired to be sureYou cant say that if you are working for a drug company Theirbusiness is to try to keep the pricing strategy the way it isI might say I dont have a beef with the drug industry I have abeef with their pricing policy that says we will sell the same drugeverywhere in the world at a fraction of the price we charge theAmerican consumer How do you make that stick By a sweetheart deal inlaw that says the American consumer cannot import the drug The Spanishcan import drugs from Germany The French can import drugs from ItalyBut the American consumer is told you dont have the freedom to shopfor that same FDAapproved drugapproved because the place where it isproduced is inspected by the FDA in a country with an identical chainof custody but the US consumer doesnt have the freedom to make thatpurchaseIf I might Dr Peter Rost the same guy just I quoted saidDuring my time responsible for a region in northeasternEurope I never oncenot onceheard the drug industryregulatory agencies the government or anyone else say thispractice was unsafe and I personally think it is outrightderogatory to claim that the Americans would not be able tohandle the reimportation of drugs when the rest of theeducated world can do thisDr Peter Rost also saidThe biggest argument against reimportation is safety Whateveryone has conveniently forgotten to tell you is that inEurope reimportation of drugs has been in place for 20yearsHank MCKinnell a former Pfizer CEO saidName an industry in which competition is allowed toflourishcomputers telecommunications small packageshipping retailing entertainment and Ill show you lowerprices higher quality more innovation and better customerservice There isnary an exception OK there is one So far the health careindustry seems immune to the discipline of competitionNowhere is that more evident with respect to pharmaceutical drugsThe question today is Will we once again offer a prescription drugimportation bill that will save consumers and the Federal Government100 billion that contains safety standards that do not exist even inthe domestic drug supply that will not pose risk but in fact reducesrisk reduces prices for the American people provides fair pricing forAmerican consumers Will we be able to vote for that legislation that Iand Senator MCCain Senator Grassley Senator Stabenow SenatorKlobuchar and so many others have brought to the floor of the SenateThe answer is yes we are going to vote on thatThe question is In the 7 days since I have offered this amendmenthas the pharmaceutical industry been able to pry enough people awayfrom this amendment because they are raising all kinds of issues ofsafetyHow many votes will we get By the way the sidebyside amendment isa killer amendment We will have a second vote A lot of people willsay We will vote for the Dorgan amendment and then vote to nullify itby voting for the Lautenberg amendmentLet me read the AARP letter which was sent yesterdayOn behalf of the AARPs nearly 40 million members we urgeyou to support the DorganSnowe importation amendment to   HR 3590 the Senate health care reform legislation Thisamendment provides for the safe legal importation of lowerpriced prescription drugs from abroad CBO has scored theamendment as saving taxpayers more than 19 billionThat is just for the Federal Government There is much more forconsumersWe also urge you to vote against an alternative importationamendment proposed by Senators Lautenberg Carper andMenendez AARP strongly opposes this amendment because itincludes the unnecessary addition of a certificationrequirement which is simply a thinly veiled effort toundermine importation and preserve the status quo of highdrug pricesSo there it is We are always told this bill is a finely craftedpiece it is like embroidering with some sophisticated colors This isa finely crafted piece and dont mess with it because if you adopt youramendment somehow the whole thing is going to come apart It is likepulling a thread on a cheap suit You pull the thread and an arm fallsoff God forbid anybody should adopt an amendment such as thisHere we are 7 days after I offered this amendment and we have acircumstance where we now have a sidebyside in order to try tonullify it We have had all kinds of dealing going on I have not beena part of it I dont know what the deals are I dont know what timethey were consummated Somebody told me late last night I am like anold Senator who served long ago I am not part of any deal I am notpart of it This deal is for the American peopleWe are going to pass some health care legislation and then we aregoing to shuffle around with our hands in our pockets maybe thumbingour suspenders sticking out our shined shoes and say We did this allright We feel really good about it but we couldnt do a thing aboutprescription drug prices We couldnt do that We didnt have thesupport because the pharmaceutical industry wouldnt let us Ohreally Maybe at lastat long long lastthere will be sufficientfriends on this vote on behalf of the American people to say We standwith the consumer We are standing with the American consumers todayWe like the pharmaceutical industry We want them to produceprescription drugs We want them to make profits We just dont wantthem to charge us 10 times 5 times 3 times or double what is beingcharged others in the world for the identical prescription drug becausewe dont think it is fair to the American peopleMr President how much time remains Isuggest the absence of a quorum I dont know whether the Senator fromNew Jersey has other speakers I believe we have a couple otherspeakers who will be here I suggest the absence of a quorum President I ask unanimous consent that the order forthe quorum call be dispensed with President I ask unanimous consent that the quorumcall be charged against both sides We havepeople coming to speak If not I will take some additional time asperhaps will the Senator from New Jersey I suggest the absence of aquorum and ask unanimous consent that it be charged to all sidesequally President I ask unanimous consent that the order forthe quorum call be rescinded President I did not speak about the letter from theFood and Drug Administration My colleagues have described this letterwhich I said could have come out of a copying machine A similar letterhas come each time we consider this legislation It is interesting tome that we export a lot of American jobs All kinds of jobs are leavingour country Then we import contaminated wallboard childrens toysthat kill kids And yes that has happened We import contaminated petfood and contaminated toothpaste We import 85 percent of the seafoodinto this country every day85 percent of the seafoodand 1 percentis inspected by the way One percent of that seafood is inspected Therest is notWe import fruits and vegetables I am wondering if the Food and DrugAdministration is sending letters around with concern about the risk tohealth of fruits and vegetables and seafoods that are not inspectedIn many places these products are produced with insecticides andvarious things that would not be permitted in this country I amwondering where the FDAs letter is with respect to thatI called the Food and Drug Administration I talked with the head ofthe FDA I said I understand there are rumors around that you aregoing to send a letter here This was 24 hours before the letter cameThe head of the FDA said I know nothing of such a letterMy question is Where did the letter come from Who prompted theletter I think I knowI find it interesting I dont see anybody at the FDA sending lettershere about the issue of safety on fruits vegetables and fish Theyraise the issue of safety with respect to a drug importation bill whichhas the most specific and the most rigorous safety standards not onlyfor imported drugs but for the existing domestic drug supply the kindof safety standards that the pharmaceutical industry has objected tofor many years I yielded to theSenator for a question If he would truncate it I would appreciate it Reclaiming my time the answer is selfevident by thequestion Of course we would benefit from stricter standards for fishvegetables and fruits That was the point I was making But what wehave done with respect to importation of prescription drugs is we haveincluded batch lots and pedigrees and tracers that do not exist in theexisting drug supply Why The existing drug supply does not have thoseprovisions because they have been objected to over the years by thepharmaceutical industryWe have put in place procedures that will make this safe You cannotsay the same thing about fruits vegetables and seafoodunfortunately A lot of work needs to be done there But we do notbring a bill to the floor of the Senate a bipartisan group oflegislators a bill that would in any way injure or provide problemswith respect to safetyWhat we do is bring to the floor of the Senate legislation thatdramatically enhances the margin of safety for prescription drugs ButI understand I understand completely If I were trying to protect andI were the drug industry trying to protect billions boy I understandthe exertion of effort to try to protect thatMy only point is this I have a beef with an industry that decidesthey are going to overcharge the American people in some cases 10times more in some cases 5 double the price that is paid in otherparts of the world for the identical drug I dont think that is fairand I dont think we should allow it to continue The way to prevent itis to give the American people the freedomevery European has thatfreedomLet me end with how I began For somebody to come out here and saythis is about unregulated untested drugs is absolute sheer nonsenseIt is not We do not have to debate what words mean and what words sayThat is not a debate we ought to take time to have All we have to dois read it and then represent it accurately which has not been thecase on the floor of the Senate regrettablyI yield the floorI suggest the absence of a quorum President I ask unanimous consent that the order forthe quorum call be rescinded President is it the case when a quorum call isrequested it is equally charged President I ask unanimous consent that the quorumcall be equally charged on both sides I suggest the absence of aquorum   President some issues we deal with here in theSenate are unbelievably complicated This one is not This is painfullysimple the question of whether the American people should be chargedand continue paying the highest prices in the world for brandnameprescription drugsmy amendment says nofrom other countries in whichthere is a safe chain of custody that is identical to ours TheAmerican people ought to have the freedom to shop for those lowerpriced FDAapproved drugs that are sold there at a fraction of thepriceI especially wish to thank Senator Begich from Alaska for his workThis is bipartisan with a broad number of Democrats and Republicansworking on this importation of prescription drugs bill giving theAmerican people the freedom to acquire lower priced drugs SenatorBegich has been a significant part of that effort I want to say thanksto him for his work on this amendment  President this amendment will save 100 billion in10 years nearly 20 billion for the Federal Government and nearly 80billion for the American consumers  But early on one of my colleagues said this is aboutuntested unregulated drugs coming from oh parts of the Soviet UnionThat is so unbelievable It is not describing the amendment I haveoffered We are talking about a chain of custody that is identical tothe United States When that is the caseif it is the casewhy wouldthe American people not have the freedom to acquire that same drug whenit is sold at onetenth the price onefifth onethird or onehalfthe price Why not give the American people that freedom  Look Iwant the pharmaceutical industry to do well to make profits to makeprescription drugs I just want fair pricing for the American people Ido not have a beef with the industry I want them to do well I wantthem however to give the American people a fair price because we arepaying the highest prices in the world for brandname prescriptiondrugs and I think it is flat out unfair This amendment will fix thatThere is a competing amendment that nullifies it that simply saysall this is going to go away and we are done with this bill and nothinghas happened to put the brakes on prescription drug pricesI hope my colleagues will stand with me and with the American peoplesaying We support fair drug prices for the American people That iswhat we are going to vote on in a few minutesI appreciate the questions from the Senator from Alaska  Madam President this amendment is about fair pricing forprescription drugs for the American people A colleague of mine justcame up to me and said My daughter takes Nexium It costs her 1000 amonth I said I happen to have a chart about Nexium here Thisillustrates better than I know how to illustrate the difference inpricingHere is what Nexium costs 424 worth of Nexium in the United Statesis sold for 40 in Great Britain 36 in Spain 37 in Germany 67 inFrance If you like this kind of pricing where the American people paythe highest prices in the world for prescription drugs if you likethis kind of pricing then you ought to vote against this amendmentBut this amendment is bipartisanRepublicans and Democrats Over 30Members of this Senate have supported this approach saying letsprovide fair pricing for a change for the American peopleWe should not be paying the highest prices in the world forprescription drugs All I ask is that you support this amendment togive the American people the opportunity for fair pricing for a change   Wehave had these votes before All I say is this The pharmaceuticalindustry flexes its muscles and defeats an attempt for fairprescription drug prices for the American people so we can keep payingthe highest prices in the world And then there is another amendmentoffered that makes it seem like something is being done when in factnothing is going to be done nothing will changeDo not vote for this amendment and go home and say you have donesomething about the price of prescription drugs because yourconstituents will know better This amendment does nothing If youbelieve at the end of the evening we should do nothing by all meansvote for it Dont count me in on that vote  President I would like to announce that theCommittee on Indian Affairs will meet on Thursday December 17 2009at 215 pm in room 628 of the Dirksen Senate Office

S_MT_BAUCUS,2009-12-02, For example with exchanges with health insurance marketreform and with the ratings reform  I amno fan of the CLASS Act myself so why dont you proceed  President it has been a very interesting discussionlistening to the Senator from New Hampshire Several points One theunderlying bill is clearly not a net increase in government spending onhealth care The numbers are bandied about by those on the other side1 trillion 25 trillion et cetera I do acknowledge and thank theSenator from New Hampshire for saying yes it is all paid for He didsay that He did agree this is all paid for So I just hope when otherSenators on that side of the aislestart talking about this big cost 1 trillion 2 trillion whateverthat they do admit it is paid for The ranking member of the SenateBudget Committee flatly said Yes it is all paid for I would hopeother Members on that side of the aisle heed the statement of theSenator from New Hampshire ranking member of the Senate BudgetCommittee for saying it is all paid forBut dont take my word for it or his word It is what the CBO saysIn fact let me quote from a letter to Senator Reid not too long agoThe CBO expects that during the decade following the 10year budget window the increases and decreases in Federalbudgetary commitment to health care stemming from thislegislation would roughly balance out so that there would beno significant change in that commitmentThat is a commitment to health care to government health carespending no change basically It is flat Although it is a littlebetter than flat because the subsequent CBO letter has said theunderlying bill achieves about 130 billion in deficit reduction over10 years and onequarter of a percent of GDP reduction in the next 10years The Senator from New Hampshire talks about large deficits thiscountry is facing That is true Frankly all of us in the Senate havea responsibility to try to reduce that budget deficit as best and asreasonably as we possibly can Bear in mind this underlying healthcare bill helps reduce the budget deficit Sometimes people on theother side like to suggest that 1 trillion over 10 years will add tothe budget deficit Again we have definitely established it does notadd to the budget deficit at all not one thin dimeIn addition we actually reduce the budget deficit through healthcare reform through this underlying legislation We all know theMedicare trust fund is in jeopardy in part because baby boomers areretiring more but also because health care costs are going up at such arapid rate That is health care costs for everybody It is health carecosts for me for every Senator for every senior for businessesLets not forget we spend in America about 60 percent more per personon health care than the next most expensive country about 50 to 60percent more per person The trend is going in the wrong direction Weare going to spend about 33 trillion in America on health care overthe next 10 years That is going to be somewhat evenly divided betweenpublic expenditures and private Every other country in the world hasfigured out ways to limit the rate of growth of increase in health carespending We havent We are the only industrialized countryin factdeveloping countrythat hasnt figured out how to get some handle onthe rate of growth of increase in health care spendingOne could say Gee lets forget about it Just let the present trendcontinue We all bandy about different figures One I am fond of atleast remembering is the average health care insurance policy inAmerica today costs about 13000 If we do nothing over 8 years itwill be 30000 That is a much higher rate of increase than income forAmericans It means the disparity between wages of the average Americanand what they are paying on health care will widen all the more if wedo nothing We have to do something This legislation is a goodfaitheffort to begin to get a handle on the rate of growth of spending inthis countryThe Senator from New Hampshire was being honest frankly Some on theother side are being not quite so honest He is basically saying Yesit is true we are not cutting beneficiary cuts although he talks aboutMedicare Advantage Let me point out that there is nothing in thislegislation that requires any reductions in any beneficiary cuts Infact guaranteed benefits under Medicare are expressly not to be cutunder the express language of this bill The portion we are talkingabout is Medicare Advantage The fact is there is nothing in this billthat requires any cuts at all in Medicare Advantage payments ThoseMedicare Advantage payments are in addition to the guaranteed Medicarepayments such as gym memberships things such as that which are notpart of traditional MedicareWhy do I say there is nothing in there that requires cuts for thoseextras That is because the decision on what benefits or what extrasMedicare Advantage plans have to give the guaranteed benefits that isby law But the decision as to what extras should go to their membersis a decision based not upon us in the government in Congress notupon the HHS Secretary it is based on the corporate officers of thesecompanies They are overpaid Medicare Advantage plans right nowEverybody knows they are overpaid Even they privately will tell youthey are overpaid They are overpaid based upon legislation thatCongress passed in 2003 the Medicare Part D by setting these highbenchmarks They are overpaid The MedPAC commission also said they areoverpaid to the tune of about between 14 and 18 percent So thereductions that are provided for in this bill in Medicare Advantageplans the effect of those reductions is up to the officers of thoseplansThey could cut premiums people otherwise pay They could cut benefitsto help themselves help their salaries They could cut stockholdersThey could cut administrative costsThey can decide what they want to do That is solely a decision ofthe executives of Medicare Advantage plans Private insurance plans iswhat they are They are private insurance plans so there is nothinghere that says the fringes the extras have to be cut at all Thoseexecutives could keep those fringes and maybe have a little less returnto their stockholders or maybe make some savings in theiradministrative costs maybe not increase their salaries There isnothing here that requires those fringes those extras to be cutnothing whatsoeverThe Senator from New Hampshire says Oh it is about 400 billion to500 billion of reduced payments to providers in this legislation Thatis true Well lets look and see what the consequences of that areFirst of all that means the Medicare trust funds solvency isextended It is more flush with cash I would think all Senators herewould like to extend the life of the Medicare trust fund A good way todo that is by what we are doing in this bill saving about 450 billionover 10 years that otherwise would be paid to Medicare providers is notbeing paid and those benefits inure to the trust fundThere is no disputenone whatsoeverthat this legislation extendsthe life of the Medicare trust fund by another 5 years That is becauseof those changes in the structure and also because there are no cuts inbenefits There are no cuts in benefits I say to Senators Althoughsometimes Senators on that side of the aisle like to either say orstrongly imply there are cuts in benefits there are no cuts inbenefits There are no cuts in the guaranteed benefits with the basicbenefits and there are no required cuts for the fringes or the extrasbecause the officers can make that decision not to cut if they wantto That is their choice as I have explained a few minutes agoLets look to see what the other side proposed not too many years agoback in 1997 They proposed cutting the Medicare benefit structurecutting payments to providers big timebig time They proposed a124percent cut to providers back in 1997 when they were in chargeThey did that in part to save the Medicare trust fund to extend thelife of the Medicare trust fundI have a hard time understanding why back then it was a good thing todo which was about three times more of a cutlets see twice asheavy a cut to Medicare providers back then in 1997 than it is todayNobody over there has explained why it was the right thing to do backthen but not the right thing to do today when the goal is the sameThe goal is the same that is to extend the solvency of the trustfundOne could sayI think the Senator from New Hampshire did saywelllets take those savings which do extend the solvency of the trustfund but nothe saidprovide another program I think he wants touse that to cut the deficit That is what I think he wants to doThat is a very basic fundamental values question I think thiscountry should face that is do we want to set up a system wherevirtually all Americans have health insurance We are the onlyindustrialized country in the world that does not have a system whereits citizens have health insurancethe only industrialized countryin the world It is a very basic question I think we should askourselves as Americans In every other industrialized country healthinsurance health care is a right That is the starting point In everyother country that has a health care system health care is a rightthat everybody should have health careOf course it is true people are different Some are tall some areshort Some are very athletically endowed some are not Some aresmart some are not so smart But health care does not carethat is away to put itwhether you are dumb smart tall skinny It affectseverybody that is diseases affect everybody and everybody needshealth care regardless of your station in life regardless of yourincome regardless of whether you are an egghead you are brilliant oran athlete It makes no difference whatsoever We are AmericansI frankly believe other countries on that point have it right thatis that they treat all their citizens basically equally becausedisease is indiscriminatewho is going to get diseaseaccidents areindiscriminatewho is going to get in an accidentand so forth So wecould take this 400 billion 500 billion and reduce the deficit withit and forget any health insurance coverage That would be an optionThat is a legitimate question we could ask ourselves I frankly thinkthe better choice is to take that 400 billion 500 billion whichdoes extend the solvency of the trust fund and help set up a way helpset up a system so all Americans have health insurance We do it in away that reduces the budget deficit We do it in a way that reduces thebudget deficit in the first 10 years and also in the next 10 yearsI again repeat if trimming the rate of growth of provider paymentswas OK back in 1997that was twice as much as today back then toextend the solvency of the Medicare trust fundwhy isnt it OK todayto do half as much to extend the life of the trust fund in this casefor 5 more years and at the same time help provide health insurancebenefits for people who deserve itLets not forget hospitals want us to do this They want everyone tohave health insurance Doctors want us to have a system where everybodyhas health insurance whether it is Medicaid or it is private healthinsurance All the providers want it The pharmaceutical industry doesthe home health industry does the hospice industry does The durablemedical equipment manufacturers want it They all want it because theyknow it is the right thing to do They also know they are not going toget hurtI heard some reference here that some HHS actuary commenting on theHouse bill said oh gee it might scare providers and whatnot but weactually got subsequent information which showed that letterthatactuary admitted it is extremely variable what he came up with Thereare lots of factors he did not take into consideration I also havestatements from hospital administrators saying no way are they going tobe allowedIn fact lets remind ourselves of this It was not too many weeksago a couple months agoremember that meetingwhen all the healthcare providers and the insurance industry went to the White House Theywere all over there What did they pledge to President Obama to helpget health care reform passed That they would cut their reimbursementsby 2 trillion over 10 years They would cut They agreed to cut theirpayments that Uncle Sam makes to them in the health care system by 2trillion over 10 years It was widely reported in the papersWhat did we do in this bill We reduced the rate of increase inpayments to providers not by 2 trillion not by 1 trillion lessthan 12 trillion over that same 10year period So if they couldcommit back then to 2 trillion you would think my gosh this is aquarter of that That is not too bad and not going to hurt anybody andproviders are not going to be leavingI might add too I have a letter from AARP to the majority leaderdated today It has been handed to me In part it saysThe legislation before the Senate properly focuses onprovider reimbursement reforms    Most importantly thelegislation does not reduce any guaranteed Medicare benefitsThis is a letter today from the American Association of RetiredPeople I will reread that portion It is addressed to Senator ReidThe legislation before the Senate properly focuses onprovider reimbursement reforms   And man we need about a week or so to talk about all the reforms inthis bill that are so important so we have a better health care systemfocusing more on quality than we currently do in the United Statessystem AgainMost importantly the legislation does not reduce anyguaranteed Medicare benefitsIn the letter they also sayAARP believes that savings can be found in Medicare throughsmart targeted changes aimed at improving health caredelivery eliminating waste and inefficiency andaggressively weeding out fraud and abuseThat is important It is very important I might add too that everyperson today who pays a Part B premiumevery American todayeverysenior today who pays that quarter that 25 percent of Part B todaypays also for the waste that is in the system today especially underPart B So if we get the waste out we also will be able to reduce thatPart B premium payment that seniors have to pay too I think that is agood thingSo the more you dig into this bill the more you see the goodfeatures I do not think all the good features have been pointed out inthis bill One of our jobs here is to point out what they are so whenthis legislation passesmark my words this legislation is going to beenacted It is going to be enacted I will not say exactly when butcertainly if not this month it will be signed by the President eitherthis month or next monththen Americans are going to start to see Ohgee there is a lot in there that is good I didnt know about thatThat is good I like that It may not be perfect but they started inthe right direction That is pretty good They are going to like itI hear all these references to polls around here and that is becauseof all the confusion in part But once it is passed and people look tosee what is in itthey will look to see what is in it because that isthe law They are forced to look to see what is in it because that isthe lawI know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle may sayYes when they look to see what is in it they will see how bad it isI disagree That is not my view My view is the more this legislationis subjected to the light of day the disinfectant of sunshine whichshows what is in this bill the more people are going to say Hey thatwas a good thing they did back then in December or JanuaryI yield the floor  As soon as I get the page number I guess I would like toask the Senator from Oklahoma a question  What page  I dont have it with me right now but there are norequired reductions in fringes or extras  Will the Senator yield for a question  May I ask the Senator another question  Is it paid for  That is a second question I would love to debate with theSenator But on the first question only the Senator admits it is paidfor   Does Medicare decide what the benefits will be for thosefolks   I think we all know the House hastaken action on physician reimbursement and the Senate will also do sobefore we adjourn That is the socalled doc fix That is a separateissue That will be paid for Putting the doctor issue aside healthcare reformand I say that because we take up the doc fix virtuallyevery year We dont take up health care reform every year That is anentirely separate proposition separate legislative endeavorIf the Senator will bear with me and take the doc fix off the tablefor a secondwe can address that laterhealth care reformto use a10year number or when you start in 2010 or in 2014 wherever you arestartingeither there is 1 trillion or 25 trillion depending whereyou start not getting into how it is paid for Is it paid for andtherefore it is not deficit am I not correct  Is it true there are nocuts in guaranteed beneficiary paymentsnone whatsoeverin thislegislationin guaranteed benefits  Is it true those provisions are not guaranteedprovisions I am talking about guaranteed benefits that seniors expectto get when they go to the doctor fee for service expected benefitsunder ordinary Medicare not benefits that a private plan may pay inaddition  President I noted that the other side in the lastcouple 3 days has tried to make the case that seniors Medicarebenefits are in jeopardy because this legislation cuts Medicare Ihave heard that statement over and over and over and over again Infact the last speaker on the other side made that same pointI am confounded I am very surprised when I hear those statementsWhy am I very surprised Because it is totally patently false It isfalse It is untrue There are no benefits cut here none One couldsay that with the private plans the Medicare Advantage plans whichare vastly overpaidthe nonpartisan MedPAC organization states theyare vastly overpaid by about 14 percentone could say those privateplansit is not Medicare those private plans Medicare Advantagethose are not Medicare plans those are private plans privateinsurance plansthey may be overprescribing some nonguaranteedbenefits for beneficiaries things such as eyeglasses or something likethat which might be cut back That is true But none of the guaranteedbenefitsthe basic benefits under Medicare that every senior knowsabout when he or she goes to the doctor and it is care underMedicareis reduced None Nothing is cutIn fact this legislation adds benefits to seniors For example itvirtually fills up this thing we call the doughnut hole That is theportion of prescription drug payments that seniors otherwise would haveto pay But we say 500 of that is going to be paid for and the restof it is going to be paid for at least for 1 more year So that is anadditional benefit Then all the screening provisions that are in thisbill that is an additional benefit There are many other benefits thatare added onto the ordinary benefits seniors haveSo it is not trueit is not truethat the basic guaranteed benefitsunder Medicare are cut None of the guaranteed benefits under Medicareare cutnone So it is totally untrue It is false when people makethe claim that Medicare is being cutThey are being very clever the people who are making those claimsWhat they are saying when they say Medicare will be cutthey want youto think they mean benefits will be cutbut deep in their mind whatthey are holding back in their mindwell when pressed they willagree well it is the Medicare providers it is the hospitals it isthe medical equipment manufacturers it is the pharmaceutical industryThat is being cut That is Medicare that is being cut andtherefore that will hurt seniors That is kind of the way they getaround itWell the fact is the way you preserve the solvency of the trustfund is to make sure there are not so many payments frankly by UncleSam going to pay for all the doctors and hospitals and so forth so thesolvency of the trust fund is extended Right now this legislationextends the solvency of the Medicare trust fund If this legislationwere not to pass the Medicare trust fund would probably go insolventin about the year 2017 But this legislation extends the solvency ofthe trust fund for at least 5 more years to 2022So I wish to make it very clear that this legislation we areconsidering does not cut Medicare benefits In fact the hospitals anddocs I would say are going to find at least a 5percent increase ingrowth over the next 10 years in payments to them under the MedicareProgramgrowth I have a chart which I showed yesterday on the floorIt showed for each of the various years it is a 5percent increase ingrowth for all those industries They are being cut 15 percent butthat is from a 65percent growth to net down to a 5percent growthfor each of the yearsYou ask analysts on Wall Street how hospitals are doing They aredoing great under this legislation You ask analysts on Wall Street howthe pharmaceutical industry is doing They are doing great under thislegislation You ask any analyst about other industrieshome healthcare hospice care you name itthey are all doing OK Wall Streetanalysts say they are doing fineWhy are they doing fine Why objectively are they doing fine Whydo the CEOs of these organizations not grumble too much Because theyknow what they may lose in a little bit of a reduction in theirpaymentsthey will still get big hefty paymentsthey will make up involume because so many more people will have health insurance Theyknow that They are going to make a lot of money So they are OKSo it is not true that Medicare is going to go broke under thislegislation First of all there is no reduction in benefits That isvery clear Senator Dodd read a letter from AARP making that veryclear Also the reductions are not reductions in provider paymentsthey are reductions in the rate of growth of provider payments andthey are going to do fine Providers do not care that much because theyare making it on volume because everybody is going to have healthinsurance They have quite a bita 5percent growth rate anyway So itis not trueit is not truethat Medicare is in jeopardy because ofthis legislation It is not true that benefits are going to be cut Infact just the opposite is true This legislation strengthens benefitsincreases benefits extends the length of the Medicare trust fund to afuture date further down the road so it stays solvent for many yearsthan otherwise is the caseThis legislation helps seniors It helps seniors contrary to whatyou are hearing on the other side that it hurts seniors If you justlook at the facts not the rhetoricnot the rhetoric but just look atthe facts look at the facts and look at who the supporters of thislegislation are and objective groups and what they say about thislegislationyou cannot help but be compelledto the conclusion that this legislation is not only good for seniorsit is very good for seniorsRecognition of the Minority LeaderThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Republican leader isrecognized  Does the Senator agree thislegislation will extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund for 5years and failure to pass this would mean the solvency of the Medicaretrust fund would not be extended for 5 years  President the Republican leader a few moments agosaid this bill raises costs With all due respect to my good friendfrom Kentucky that statement is falseJust this week the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office theorganization that analyzes legislationand both sides both bodiesdepend on it it is a very professional outfit I might addsaid ourbill would reduce premiums not increase but reduce premiums for 93percent of Americans And for all Americans it would make sure thatbetter quality insurance is availableLet me state that a little bit differently The Congressional BudgetOffice said that for 93 percent of Americans premiums would bereduced It is true that for 7 percent that is not the case Those areAmericans whose incomes are too high to qualify for subsidies that isthe tax credits buying insurance in exchange But those 7 percentwould get a lot better insurance a lot higher quality insurance thanthey get today because of the insurance market reforms that are in thislegislation The provisions prevent insurance companies from denyingcoverage based on preexisting conditions health status the committeemarket rating provisions no rescissions et cetera So for allAmericans it is true that this legislation will provide better qualityinsurance comparing apples with apples There is a reduction for 93percent of Americans The other 7 percent would be in the individualmarket and they would have a lot higher quality insurance So if thequality is much higher it would exceed the increase in premiums Theywould be getting a better deal than they would otherwise be gettingCBO looked at this for the year 2016 They didnt look at it forother years but at least that is the case for 2016 a reduction notan increase but a reduction In fact for many in the nongroup marketthose who individually buy insurance they would find their premiumswould be reduced about 40 or 50 percent About 60 percent of those inthe nongroup market are finding their insurance premiums would bereduced I dont have the exact figure in front of me but it is in theneighborhood of a 40 or 50percent reduction in premiums That is dueto tax credits Again CBO says those tax credits would cover nearlytwothirds of premiums So I guess I was a little conservative It is alittle more than 40 or 50 percent It would cover twothirds ofpremiumsCBO said those getting these tax credits would pay for roughly 56percent to 59 percent lower premiums than they would without our billThose are real savings That is with respect to the premiumsWhat about outofpocket costs This legislation has absolute limitson outofpocket costs Today insurance companies can sell you apolicy you pay certain premiums but there is no limit on the outofpocket costs you might have to pay Your deductible is so high forexample This legislation puts an absolute limit so no policy can besold that allows you to have outofpocket costs above a certainamount I think it is 6000 for an individual and it might be doublethat for a family But there is a limit So this bill does not asstated by the minority leader raise costs In fact it reduces costsIn addition there are many people who say Oh gosh this is a 1trillion bill Some people even say it is a 25 trillion billSenators on the other side of the aisle make those statements and theysay this to try to scare usI will be honest with you I dont know if they believe it They likesaying it because it is a nice good scare tactic I say I am not surethey believe it I wonder if they believe it because when you read thelegislation it is deficit neutral It does not add to the deficitWe have a budget resolution Under that budget resolution healthcare legislation for the next 10 years has to be deficit neutral Itcannot add one thin dime to the deficit So I am a little curious whenpeople talk about a 1 trillion bill In fact it reduces the deficitby 130 billion over a 10year period That is what the CongressionalBudget Office says the professional nonpartisan budget officeIn the second 10 years the CBO says our bill reduces the deficit bya onequarter of 1 percent of the gross domestic product That isroughly 12 trillion In the second 10 years this legislationreduces the deficit by 12 trillion That is a reduction in thedeficitI dont know why these people are saying on the other side that thisis a trilliondollar bill One saidand I will not mention his namethe other day that this is a 25 trillion bill That is not true Itis just not true because it is paid for It would only be fair for themto say it is paid for I think it is fair to get both sides of thestory not just one side It does cost 1 trillion over 10 years butit is more than paid for over 10 years Those who say 25 trillionthey start at 2014 up to 2020 and say that is why it costs so much Itis paid for during those years tooLet me make it very clear this bill doesnt raise costs In fact itlowers costs and the CBO says so It doesnt add to the Federaldeficit In fact it reduces the Federal deficit I urge everyone tolook at the facts closely whenever we hear statements made by anybodyincluding me I urge people to listen to the words and read between thelines and see what is really going on Like my father used to sayDont believe everything you read and only half of what you hear Takeeverything with a few grains of saltThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mr KIRK The Senator from Tennessee isrecognized  Which colleague is the Senator asking that   Might I respond to the Senator    The basic question obviously is how to protectMedicare benefits I think most of us would say how do we protectMedicare benefits and extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund Ithink we would all agree that excessive payments to providers wouldcause insolvency of the trust funds to come earlier rather thanlater We all agree with that propositionThe next question is What would excessive payments to providers beDo providers get paid excessively I think that is an honest questionwe should ask ourselves in a way to help extend the solvency of theMedicare trust fund In fact in 1995 many Senators especially on theother side of the aisle did say just that that we have to cutMedicare in order to save benefits That was made by many Senators Ihave them right in front of me if anybody wants to hear them I am notgoing to go through all of that but it is the truth That is exactlywhat we are doing in this bill We are trying to help extend thesolvency of the Medicare trust fund by cutting down on excessiveprovider payments from the Medicare trust fundHow do we decide whether payments are excessive That is the basicquestion here All we can do is just give it our best shot make ourbest judgment I think it makes sense to look at the recommendations byoutside independent groups what they think One is MedPAC theMedicare Payment Advisory Commission That is an outside group as weall know that advises Congress on Medicare payments As Members ofCongress we are not totally competent to know exactly what dollarsshould go to which industry group We have too many other obligationsto think about As Senators we must be responsible to do the best wecan MedPAC has said these groups have been overpaid And Wall Streetanalysts tend to agree In fact MedPAC said with respect to MedicareAdvantage that they have been overpaidI forget the exact amount butmuch less than the 118 billion reduction in this billIn fact I totaled up and looked at the projected growth rate ofprovidershospitals nursing homes home health hospice PhRMA youname itand on average their growth rate over the next decade is goingto be 612 percent That is the growth rate of providers We decidedto trim that a little bit by 15 percent So it is 5 percent It is a5percent growth rate in an attempt to try to find the right levels ofreimbursement to providers which will also help extend the solvency ofthe Medicare trust fundWhen we talk to providers they basically agree with those cuts Theybasically agree Why do they basically agree They basically agreebecause they know that with much more coverage with many more peoplehaving health insurance they could spread out their business They maylose a little on margin but they can pick it up on volume That isexactly what their business plan is under this billWall Street analysts sayI quote themthese industries are doinggreat they are doing well under this bill They are not getting hurtSo we do achieve a winwinI dont like that phrase by the way but Iwill use it herewhere the solvency of the trust fund is beingextended and where reimbursement rates to providers are fairnot beinghurt it is fair And that is why they want this bill by and largeMost groups tend to want this bill enacted because they know it isgood for the country it is good for the seniors and it is good forthem too  With all due respect I did notsay that  I did not talk about doctorsoverpaid If I may say to my friend from Tennessee this legislationpays more to primary care doctors a 10percent increase in Medicarereimbursement for each of the next 5 years I did not say doctors  You already said it but I think it is worth repeating Most seniors as they pay Part B premiums under fee forservice dont get any benefit whatsoever   The figure I sawI guess it is 90 a year they pay extraand get no benefit from it  If the Senator will yield for another question might Iask my friend if it isnt also true that in the June MedPAC report itstates that Medicare Advantage overpayments cost taxpayers an extra 12billion  I think the pointthe Senator from Illinois is making needs to be underlined two or threeor four times hereand the Senator from Connecticut has made it tooand that is there is a huge distinction between Medicare and theseprivate insurance plans What Medicare Advantage is overpaidthat is what these insurancecompanies are overpaid and a lot of that goes back to the Part D drugbill and so forthdo those overpayments necessarily mean betterbenefits for persons who signed up for those plans  If that is true why might that be the case just sopeople understand  Will the Senator yield for a question  Fringes such as gym memberships and extras such asthat The bill basically provides that there be no reductions inguaranteed Medicare payments There is a long list of what guaranteedMedicare payments areEven the Medicare Advantage companies which are private companieswith officers and they have stockholdersthey have to report to theirboard of directors and they have all these administrative costs veryhuge admin costs The reductions to Medicare Advantagethe applicationof reductions to Medicare Advantage plans are at the discretion of theofficers The officers can decide they are not going to cut thefringes that is the fringes and the extras that are beyond inaddition to the guaranteed Medicare benefitsIf an officer wants to it is his discretion I am assuming  Will the Senator yield  Isnt ittrue that the MedPAC commission came to the conclusion that theMedicare Advantage plans are overpaid  It is also true that it is their recommendation that theMedicare plans overpaid by the amount of 14 percent   If they are overpaid doesnt that necessarily mean thereare reductions in payments attributable to each beneficiary bydefinition  If they are overpaid  In 2003 I made the mistake and agreed togive the Medicare Advantage plans way more money than they deservedAnd as the Senator from Oklahoma has said they are overpaid  But isnt that a pretty good systemdont put too manyeggs in one basket Doesnt each keep the others on their toes a littlebit  Doesnt this legislation provide for more competitionthan currently exists  President I ask unanimous consent that SenatorWhitehouse Senator Stabenow Senator Dodd and I be allowed to engagein a colloquy  I ask my colleagues is it not true that basically inAmerica although all of America spends about 25 trillion on healthcare basically it is 5050 It is 41 or 42 percent public and about 60percent private We in America have roughly a 5050 system today isthat right  This legislation before us basically retains that currentdivision What we are doing is coming up with uniquely American ideasWe are not Great Britain France or Canada We are roughly 5050alittle more private in fact In 2007 it was 46 percent public andabout 54 percent private Roughly that is where we are It mightchange ever so slightly But we are not those other countries we areAmericaThis legislation before us maintains that philosophy is thatcorrect  I ask my colleagues is there anything in thislegislation which will interfere with the doctorpatient relationshipthat is to date people choose their own doctors whichever doctor theywant They can by and large go to the hospital they want althoughthe doctor may send them to another hospital Is there anything in thislegislation that diminishes that freedom of choice patients would haveto choose their doctor  What about the procedures doctors might want to choosefor their patients Is there anything in this legislation whichinterferes with the decision a physician might make as to whichprocedure to prescribe in consultation with his or her patient  I might ask my friendthat is very trueCould heexplain maybe how doctors may be in this legislation empowered tohave better information to help them provide even better care What aresome of the provisions  I think it is important not to overpromise because someof these initiatives some of these programs will take a little time totake effect In fact some of the provisions do not take effect for acouple 3 years But still wouldnt my colleagues agree that some ofthese are going to probably yield tremendous dividends in the futureespecially generally the focus on quality not outcomes reimbursingphysicians and hospitals based on quality not outcomes the pilotprojects the bundling the counter care organizations and othersimilar efforts in this legislation One of the two or both may want tocomment on that point I think it is a point worth making   Some people are worried perhaps gee there theygo back there in Congress They talk about wastewhich is good wewant to get rid of waste But then when they talk about waste theytalk about cutting out the waste some think Gee if they are cuttingout the waste and they are cutting health care reimbursements geewont that hurt health care in America Wont that harm health care inAmerica Wont that reduce quality If they are cutting so much 600billion 700 billion 800 billionthat is a lot of moneyarentthey going to start cutting quality health care in AmericaI see my good friend the chairman of the HELP Committee on thefloor He may want to join in this discussion as well adding differentpoints as to why the legislation we are putting together increasesquality does not cut quality but it increases quality at the sametime it reduces waste I wonder if my colleagues might comment on allof that because it is an extremely I think important point to drivehome our legislation improves quality health care  As he wasspeaking I was thinking of that article a lot of us have referred tooften the June 1 New Yorker article by Atul Gawande comparing ElPaso TX and MCAllen TX They are both border towns In El Pasohealth care expenditures per person are about half what they are inMCAllen And yet the outcomes in El Paso are better than they are inMCAllenOne might ask Why in the world is that happening Why is there twiceas much spent in MCAllen than El Paso and the outcomes are differentThe answer is we have a system which allows the MCAllens in the systemthat allows payment in basic quantity and volume as opposed to qualityI believe it depends on the community what the culture is Somecommunities have a culture of patientfocused care The current systemallows that but unfortunately if the culture in the community ismore to make money our reimbursement system today allows for that aswell So I think one of the things we are trying to do is to get morequality in the systemreimbursement to pay doctors and hospitalsmorequality as you have saidand that is going to even out a lot of thegeographic disparities that have occurred in the country over time andso the quality will increase and the cost and the waste will decrease  In fact it is interestingthe Senator mentioned his name because not too long ago I asked himthat question I said Why Dr Berwick is it that in some communitiesthey get it and some they do not His answer was that sometimes thereis somebodymaybe it is a hospital or someone who is a pretty dominantplayerwho kind of starts it out and gets it right and that is trueHe invited 10 integrated systems to Washington DC to kind of talkover what works and what doesnt workThese are not the bignamed institutions they are the lesser namedinstitutions In fact one of them I can probably say is the BillingsClinic in Billings MTnot too widely known but they participatedlast yearthe same process and integration with the docs the acutecare and the postacute care They have significantly cut costs theyhave significantly improved the quality and they are very proud ofwhat they have done  My mother was inthe hospital 3 years agoin another hospital not the BillingsClinicand there was no discharge plan There was no way to helpdeliver health care for her when she left the hospital and went into arehab centersort of a nursing home Sure enough she didnt get theproper meds she didnt get the proper attention the doctor did notsee her every day or after that and lo and behold she had to bereadmitted to the hospital She had a gastrointestinal issue and sureenough they took care of her back in the hospital But once she wasdischarged they did it right They improved upon the mistakes they hadmadeSo I saw it firsthand and it irritated the dickens out of mefrankly in seeing how they did not pay sufficient attention to mymother If this happens to my mother my gosh I bet it is even worsein lots of other situations  I madesure of that  I was talking to the head of DenverHealth It is an integrated system I have forgotten the name but shewas so enthusiastic about the integration she performed with DenverHealth I will give you one small example and it is one you justmentioned She said We have patients hereheart patientsand whenthey are discharged we ask them Are you taking your meds Are youcontrolling your blood pressure Are you taking your medication tocontrol your blood pressureThey say Oh yeah yeah yeah I am taking my medsShe says Well why is your blood pressure so highThe response is Well I I I Because they areintegrated they check with their pharmacy which is part oftheir system to check the refill rate of the patients Sureenough they find their patients refill history shows theywere not taking their meds So they get the patients back andthey say You are not taking your medsThey say Oh I guess I wasntThey tell them We are checking on youSo sure enough they take their meds and they have a much betteroutcome generally with their cardio patients because of thatintegration   I dont know how much longer my colleague wanted tospeak but some time ago I know Senator Hatch wanted to speak at 5oclock so I am trying to be traffic cop here
S_WY_ENZI,2009-12-15,  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consentthat the time be divided equally  President I yield up to 20 minutes to the Senator fromAlabama out of the leader time  Reserving the right to object we have had constantspeakers over here so we have used a lot of our time If we had knownthere was more vacant time and if we could have had some of themajoritys time we could have had a steady stream of speakers overhere the whole time So we would reluctantly agree to the time beingdivided between the two sides as we have done that in all the times inthe past but we want to reserve some time for our speakers as well Wecould have easily had people over here to speak  President I rise today to talk about prescription drugimportation As my colleagues know I oppose this proposalIt is our job as Senators to debate the issues put forward ourideas and show where we stand I was disappointed that Democraticleadership chose to prevent the Senate from voting on amendments toimprove this bill for the past 6 days I am however glad the impassehas finally been resolvedI am not afraid to show where I stand on this issue Some of mycolleagues on both sides of the aisle support importation Some likeme oppose it But my position is clear and does not change with thepolitical windsThe winds I am referring to include the arrangement that wasreportedly negotiated with the drug manufacturers Under the terms ofthis backroom deal the drug manufacturers have reportedly agreed to80 billion in price cuts and provided a commitment to spend 150million in ads supporting the Reid billIn exchange Senate Democratic leadership and President Obama havereportedly agreed to block efforts to enact drug importation fromCanadaAccording to one Wall Street analysts report the Reid bill isexpected to increase drug company profits by more than 137 billionover the next 4 years Lets do the math on that 80 billion in cutsleading to 137 billion in increased profitsWhile this may be a good deal from the drug manufacturers and SenateDemocrats it certainly is not a good deal for the American peoplePart of the reported deal will actually increase Medicare costs to thetaxpayer because it creates an incentive for Medicare beneficiaries tocontinue using brandname drugsAccording to the Congressional Budget Office Federal Medicare costswill be increased by 15 billion over the next decade as a result ofthis deal In the last few days there have been new press reportshighlighting how the drug manufacturers may have agreed to provide evendeeper discounts on their brandname drugs No one knows how much morethis deal will cost the taxpayersIn addition to increasing the price Americans will pay for the Reidbill this deal appears to have also undermined Democratic support fora drug importation amendmentMy colleagues who believe importation is the right way to lower drugcosts say that it will save the government 19 billion and consumers80 billion over the next 10 yearsThe majority leader has previously voted for drug importationPresident Obama supported drug importation when he was in the SenateThe supporters of drug importation should be able to easily pass thisamendment without any limitationsYet it looks like the supporters of drug importation will not succeedtoday It appears likely that safety certification language similar tolanguage included in prior years will be added to this proposalMy colleagues each know where they stand on the issue But the dealwith the drug manufacturers is apparently so important that supportersof drug importation are going to vote against the proposalIt is important for the American people to understand why there hasbeen this change of heart on this issue The drug manufacturers are oneof the few remaining health care groups that still support the Reidbill They have committed to spend 150 million to buy television adsto support the Democrats efforts on health reformIf my Democratic colleagues fail to adopt drug importation withoutthe safety language it is because the Senate Democratic leadership andthe White House have decided they will do whatever it takes to keep thesupport of the drug manufacturers They believe that the money thesecompanies will spend will be enough to convince the American people tosupport their effortsThe American people already understand that the Reid bill is not agood deal for them They understand how this bill will raise theirtaxes increase their insurance premiums and cut Medicare benefits formillions of seniorsThat is why over 60 percent of Americans now oppose the Democratichealth reform proposals No amount of advertising funded by the drugcompanies or anyone else is going to change that reality
S_NC_HAGAN,2009-12-15, President I rise today to speak about drugreimportation With millions of seniors balancing drug regimens thatentail taking several medicines per day on a fixed income I believe weneed to find a way to ensure that they have access to affordable drugsIf we could reduce the cost of drugs with reimportation and guaranteethe safety of those drugs I would be very supportive However I haveserious doubts that we can adequately ensure the safety of our drugsupply with the drug reimportation amendment proposed by my colleaguefrom North DakotaEven without reimportation the United States has had trouble withcounterfeit drugs At the height of the H1N1 epidemic this fall theFDA was warning consumers to be wary of counterfeit H1N1 treatmentsThese counterfeits came from foreign online pharmacies In oneinstance the FDA seized socalled H1N1 treatment tablets from Indiaand found them to contain talc and acetaminophen Last month theWashington Post reported on a coordinated global raid of counterfeitdrugs from the United States to Europe to Singapore The United Statesdiscovered about 800 alleged packages of fake or suspiciousprescription drugs including Viagra Vicodin and Claritin and shutdown 68 alleged rogue online pharmaciesCounterfeit pharmaceutical drugs are appearing on the market atincreasingly alarming rates In 2007 drugs comprised 6 percent of thetotal counterfeit product seizures In 1 year they have now jumped to10 percent of all counterfeit product seizuresThis growing problem is all about unscrupulous criminals preying onthe sick and the elderly who are in desperate need of cheaper drugsBut the consequences are harmful and in some cases deadlyOfficials estimate that some of these counterfeit drugs containeither a dangerous amount of active ingredients or were placebos Somecounterfeits include toxic chemicals such as drywall materialantifreeze and even yellow highway paintAccording to a recent Washington Post article tracing the origins ofdrugs such as Cialis and Viagra took investigators across the globe andback again Supposedly these drugs came from a warehouse in New Delhithough the online company selling the drug was headquartered in Canadaand was licensed to sell medicine in Minnesota However when Federalofficials investigated the drug origins further they actually foundthat the online Web site was registered in China its server was hostedin Russia and its headquarters had previously been listed inLouisianaOn a local level near our capital the Baltimore Sun yesterdayreported on the death of a University of Maryland pharmacologistCarrie John Ms John suffered an allergic reaction to a counterfeitversion of a legal drug in the United States but purchased illegallyfrom the Philippines Apparently the counterfeit drug so closelyresembled the legal version that two pharmacologists conducting theanalysis after Ms Johns death could not tell the difference Localpolice have yet to identify the contents of the counterfeit drugA few of my colleagues have already mentioned the letter sent lastweek by FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg outlining the safety concernsthe FDA has about reimportation Specifically the FDA stated thatimporting nonFDAapproved prescription drugs posed four potentialrisks to patients Let me go over those four risksNo 1 The drug may not be safe and effective because it did notundergo the rigorous FDA regulatory review processNo 2 The drug may not be a consistently made high quality productbecause the facility in which it was manufactured was not reviewed bythe FDANo 3 The drug may not be substitutable with the FDAapprovedproduct because of differences in composition or manufacturingNo 4 The drug could be contaminated or counterfeit as a result ofinadequate safeguards in the supply chainIf the agency that oversees drug safety is saying it would havedifficulty guaranteeing the safety of our Nations drug supply withreimportation I have grave concerns particularly since the FDA isalready underfunded and understaffedBut lets take a moment to examine how Europe which does allowreimportation has fared in terms of safetyBritish authorities say counterfeit drugs often exchange handsbetween middlemen and are repackaged multiple times before reaching alegitimate hospital or pharmacist This creates opportunities forcounterfeit products often produced in China and shipped through theMiddle East to penetrate the European market President I ask unanimous consent for 3 additionalminutes In 2008 British authorities identified 40000 doses ofcounterfeit Casodex a hormone treatment for men with advanced prostatecancer and Plavix a blood thinnerMore recently the European Union seized 34 million fake tablets atcustoms points in all member countries In other countries around theworld the World Health Organization estimates that up to 30 percent ofthe medicines on sale may be counterfeit As a result numerous peoplehave diedEarlier this year 80 infants in Nigeria died from teething medicinethat contained a toxic coolant In July 24 children in Bangladesh diedfrom the consumption of poisonous acetaminophen syrupThe Dorgan amendment does not require imported drugs to be FDAapproved or meet FDA misbranding standards Furthermore it does notprevent criminals in other countries from repackaging imported drugsAlthough our safety system is not perfect we have a thorough FDAreview system for drug safety that actively involves physicianspharmacists and patients As a result Americans can be generallyconfident that our medications are safe and contain the ingredients onthe bottleSupporters of reimportation argue that the sick and elderly need analternative way to obtain affordable drugs However a study by theLondon School of Economics found that in the European Union middlemenreaped most of the profits with relatively little savings passed downto the consumer Nothing in the Dorgan amendment requires the savingsto be passed on to the consumer leaving the door wide open forunscrupulous profitseeking third parties to get into thereimportation gameIn the United States we are already trying to reduce the cost ofprescription drugs through the use of generics This is one of the mosteffective ways for customers to reap savings and the genericdispensing rate at retail pharmacies is close to 65 percent The FDA isalready working with stakeholders to develop drug reimportation policyWith the FDA looking into this and significant outstanding safetyconcerns I cannot in good conscience support the amendment offered bymy colleague from North Dakota Instead I will support the amendmentoffered by my colleague from New Jersey The Lautenberg amendment willallow the importation of drugs only if the Secretary of Health andHuman Services certifies that doing so would save money for Americansand would not adversely affect the safety of our drug supplyWhile it is critical that all Americans especially our Nationsseniors have access to affordable drugs it is imperative that we notcompromise the safety of US drugs on the market After all what goodare cheap drugs if they are toxic or ineffectiveThank you Mr President I yield the floor
S_NV_ENSIGN,2009-12-02,   Iwish to make some general comments about it First following thecomments of my colleague from Illinois he said there are not 12trillion in Medicare cuts According to the Congressional BudgetOffice there are 464 billion to 465 billion in Medicare cuts Somaybe not quite 12 trillion but we are certainly getting closeThere are however 12 trillion in new taxes in this bill 84percent of which will be paid by those making less than 200000 ayear a direct violation of the campaign pledge made by PresidentBarack Obama thenCandidate ObamaThis bill will result in increased premiums and health care costs formillions of Americans This is a massive government takeover of ourhealth care system As a matter of fact according to the NationalCenter for Policy Analysis in this 2074 page billthere are almost1700 1697 to be exactreferences to the Secretary of Health andHuman Services giving her the authority to create determine ordefine things relating to health care policy in this bill Basicallywe are placing a bureaucrat in charge of health care policy instead ofthe patient and the doctor making the choices in health careI believe we cannot just be against this bill What I do believe inis a stepbystep approach an incremental approach some good ideas onwhich we should be able to come togetherI think both sides agree we should eliminate preexisting conditionsSomebody who played by the rules had insurance happened to get adisease they should not be penalized charged outrageous prices orhave their insurance dropped I think we can all agree on thatWe should be able to agree that if you can buy auto insurance acrossState lines you should be able to buy health insurance in the Statewhere it is the cheapest Individuals should be able to find a Statethat has a policy that fits them and their family and be able to buy itthere If you can save money and you happen to be uninsured especiallytoday it seems to make sense Lets have that as one of ourincremental stepsI also believe this bill covers some of it but I believe we need toincentivize people to engage in healthier behaviors Seventyfivepercent of all health care costs are caused by peoples behaviors Letme repeat that Threequarters of all health care costs are driven bypeoples poor choices in their behaviorFor instance smoking On average it is around 1400 a year toinsure a smoker versus a nonsmoker For somebody who is obese versussomebody with the proper body weight it is about the same 1400 ayear For somebody who does not control their cholesterol versussomebody on regulating medication it is several hundred dollars ayear For somebody who does not control their blood pressure versussomebody who doeslets give incentives through lower premiums toencourage people to engage in healthier behaviors That will save moneyfor the entire health care system and our Country will have healthierpeople with better quality livesCurrently big businesses because of their number of employees areallowed to take advantage of purchasing power We ought to allowindividuals and small businesses to join together ingroups to take advantage of that purchasing power They are calledsmall business health plansI believe my colleagues are going to talk about an idea they havesomething I talked about for years the idea of medical liabilityreform There are several models out there They are going to talkabout a loser pays model which other countries have engaged in andthey do not have nearly the frivolous lawsuits nor the defensivemedicine we practice in this countryHow many doctors order unnecessary tests in the United States becauseof fear of frivolous lawsuits Talk to any doctor and they will tellyou every one of them orders unnecessary tests simply to protectthemselves against the possibility that a jury may say Gee why didntyou order this test even though it was not indicated at the timeThat accounts for a large amount of medical costs As a matter offact the Congressional Budget Office said 100 billion between theprivate and public sector would be saved with a good medical liabilityreform billI believe we need a patientcentered health care system not aninsurance companycentered health care system not what this bill doesa governmentcentered health care system where bureaucrats are incontrol of your health care We need a patientcentered systemBefore us we have the Mikulski amendment This is more of governmentcentered health care There is a report out based on prevention thatindicates that mammograms should not be paid for basically for womenunder 50 years of age from 40 to 50 years of age and women in theMedicare population age the report indicates that they do not needannual mammograms This was based mainly on cost If you look at itfrom a cost standpoint that is probably correctBut think about it If you are a woman and you get cancer and youcould have had a mammogram diagnose it a lot earlier you sure wouldrather have had that mammogram rather than have that mammogram deniedThe Senator from Maryland has proposed an amendment to try to fix theproblem The problem is instead of one government entity determiningwhether somebody is going to get coverage the amendment turns it overto the Secretary of Health and Human Services Another governmentbureaucrat will determine whether something such as a mammogram will bepaid for According to the Associated Press her amendment does noteven mention mammogramsSenator Murkowski and Senator Coburn have come up with an alternativethat actually puts the decision of whether to cover preventive servicesin the hands of experts in the field Whether it be a mammogram forbreast cancer or an MRI which most people think is going to be betterthan a mammogram for diagnosing breast cancer or whether it is a testfor prostate cancer for men Those kinds of things should be determinedby experts in the field not by government bureaucratsThe various collegesthe American College of Obstetrics andGynecology for instance has come out with certain recommendationsalong with the American College of Surgeons Those are the experts withpeerreviewed science Those are the individuals who should determinewhat the recommendations are as to whether we pay for preventiveservices not government bureaucratsUnfortunately the Mikulski amendment just gives that determinationto a government bureaucrat That is why we should reject the Mikulskiamendment and adopt the amendment offered by the Senator from Alaskathe Murkowski amendment puts the decision making in the hands of the ofthe experts where that decision should be madeLet me close with this point We have seen a lot of comparisons whereare people saying that other countries have a better health care systemthan the United States Let me give you the example of cancer survivalratesThis chart compares the average cancer survival rates in the EuropeanUnion and the United States it makes the point as to whether agovernment bureaucrat is making a health decision or the doctor and thepatient are making the health treatment decisionFor kidney cancer the European Union has a 56 percent 5 yearsurvival rate the United States 63 percent survival rate after 5years On colorectal cancer about the same difference between theUnited States and the European Union Look at breast cancer 79 percentafter 5 years in the European Union 90 percent in the United StatesThe most dramatic difference is on prostate cancer 78 percent survivalafter 5 years in the European Union 99 percent survival rate in theUnited StatesThese are dramatic differences Where would you rather get yourhealth care if you had one of these cancers The United States orEuropeCanada has even worse results than this As a matter of factBelinda Stronach a member of the Canadian Parliament led the chargeagainst a private system side by side with the governmentrun system inCanada She did not want the private systemTragically a couple years later she developed breast cancer Didshe stay in Canada to get treatment where there is a governmentrunhealth care system No Where did she go She came to the UnitedStates She was actually treated at UCLA Why because we have asuperior system of quality in the United StatesWe have a problem with cost Some of the incremental steps I talkedabout will address costsI wish to turn it over now to my colleagues who are going to talkabout medical liability reform Lets look out for the patient insteadof the trial lawyers in the United States Their idea on a loser payssystem I think has a lot of merit and it is something this bodyshould consider very seriouslyI yield the floor to the Senator from Georgia my good friend andcolleague  President I ask unanimous consent that I and my twocolleagues be able to engage in a colloquy President I would like to start by talking about thebill in general
S_IL_DURBIN,2009-12-02,I say at this point in time we have three or four amendments beforethe Senate on health care reform We started the debate on Monday Weare now wrapping up Wednesday We are about to go into the 4th day ofthe debate on one of the most important bills in the history of theUS Senate and we have yet to reach an agreement with the Republicanside of the aisle to have the amendments voted onIf we are only doing four amendments or three amendments in 4 daysthis is not going to be the kind of debate the American peopleexpected They expected us to bring issues before the floor heredebate them with a reasonable period of time and then vote and moveto another issue Certainly there are a lot of things to talk aboutSo I hope the Republican side of the aisle will have a change ofheart and will start to join us in this dialog will offer theiramendments in a timely fashionwe will give them their opportunity todebate themand then bring them to a vote But the fact is we havenot had a single vote this week on health care reform amendmentsbecause of objections from the other side That is not in the interestof moving forward this important legislation and giving Members anopportunity to present their amendments and have them voted on in atimely fashionMr President I yield the floor President I ask unanimous consent that after anyleader time on Thursday December 3 and the Senate resumesconsideration of HR 3590 it be in order for any of the majority orRepublican bill managers to be recognized for a total period of timenot to extend beyond 10 minutes equally divided and controlled thatthe time until 1145 am be for debate with respect to the Mikulskiamendment No 2791 and the MCCain motion to commit and during thistime it be in order for Senator Murkowski to call up her amendment withrespect to mammography a copy of which is at the desk and that italso be in order for Senator Bennet of Colorado to call up amendmentNo 2826 a sidebyside amendment with respect to the MCCain motion tocommit that no other amendments or motions to commit be in orderduring the pendency of these amendments and motion that at 1145 amthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Mikulski amendment No2791 that upon disposition of the Mikulski amendment the Senate thenproceed to vote in relation to the Murkowski amendment that upondisposition of these two amendments the Senate continue to debateuntil 245 pm the Bennet of Colorado amendment No 2826 and theMCCain motion to commit with the time equally divided and controlledbetween Senators Baucus and MCCain or their designees that at 245pm the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Bennet of Coloradoamendment No 2826 that upon disposition of that amendment the Senatethen proceed to vote in relation to the MCCain motion to commit thatprior to the second vote in each sequence there be 2 minutes ofdebate equally divided and controlled in theusual form that each of the above referenced amendments or motion besubject to an affirmative 60vote threshold and that if the amendmentsor motion do not achieve that threshold then they be withdrawnfurther that if any of the above listed achieve the 60vote thresholdthen the amendment or motion be agreed to and the motion to reconsiderbe laid upon the table further that it be in order if there is arequest for the yeas and nays to be ordered with respect to thatamendment or motion regardless of achieving the 60vote thresholdthat if the yeas and nays are ordered the vote would occur immediatelywith no further debate in order with respect to this particularconsent  I say to the Senator from Connecticut could wecharacterize this as an earmark in the Medicare Advantage Program  Will the Senator yield for a question  It is interesting to me that under the MCCain amendmentthe first line in the amendmentthe motion to commitrelates toMedicare Advantage I used to work for an old fellow in Illinoispolitics named Cecil Partee and Cecil said For every issue inpolitics there is a good reason and a real reason We hear a lot ofgood reasons on the floor for this MCCain amendment and the future ofMedicare The real reason is on the first line of Senator MCCainsmotion to commit He says Send this back to committee and dont touchMedicare AdvantageI want to ask the Senator from Connecticut about Medicare Advantagebecause some of the things I have read around the country aboutMedicare Advantage tell me this plan run by private health insurancecompanies costs more than basic Medicare These companies promised uswhen they got involved they would show us how to run a healthinsurance plan They would show us how to provide Medicare benefits andthey would save us money Some have But by and large if I am notmistaken isnt the verdict ina 14percent increase in cost forMedicare benefits under this Medicare Advantage  When we talk about saving over 100 billion in theMedicare Program over the 10 years part of it is by saying to thoseprivate health insurance companies that are overcharging Medicarerecipients the party is over The subsidy is over We are going tomake sure that every American who qualifies for Medicare gets the basicbenefits but we will not allow these private health insurancecompanies to get a subsidy from the Federal Government at the expenseof Medicare and its recipients  So the motive behind the MCCain amendment is less aboutsaving Medicare and more about saving a private health insuranceprogram called Medicare Advantage  Madam President it seems I am following the Senator fromIowa every day I first wish to acknowledge my friendship and respectfor him But the Medicare Advantage Program which the Republican sideis trying to protect is a program which is private health insuranceThe largest political opponent to health care reform in America isthe private health insurance industry We estimate they have spent 23million so far lobbying to defeat this bill because they are doing verywell under the current system They are very profitable companies andthey realize if they face competition limitations on the way they dobusiness it will cut into their bottom line and their profits andnaturally are fighting the billThe amendment before us the motion to commit by Senator MCCainthefirst thing it does is to protect the Medicare Advantage Program Thatis a private health insurance program that was created with the promisethat it would be cheaper than traditional governmentrun Medicare Insome cases they have offered a cheaper policy But overall theseprivate health insurance companies are charging the Medicare Program 14percent more than the actual cost of the governmentrun systemThe promise that the private sector could do it more cheaply andbetter turned out not to be true So we are paying a subsidy inprofitsextra profitsto private health insurance companies TheMCCain amendment which has been supported by Senator Grassley andothers who have come to the floor is an effort to stop us fromeliminating this subsidyWhat is this subsidy worth This subsidy to private health insurancecompanies will cost the Medicare Program 170 billion over the next 10yearsno small amount We believe that money is better spent onextending benefits to Medicare beneficiaries not in providingadditional profits to already profitable private health insurancecompaniesYes Medicare Advantage policies are offering Medicare benefits butthey are charging more for it than the government So it did not turnout to be a bargain It turned out to be a loss to the MedicareProgram They did not do what they promised to do We want to hold themaccountable The MCCain amendment wants to let them off the hook andbasically say Private health insurance companies keep drawing thatmoney out of Medicare We are not going to hold you accountableThat earmark of the Medicare Advantage Program that decision byCongress to give them a special privilege in selling this healthinsurance is too darn expensive for senior citizens and people whorely on Medicare That is why we are opposing the MCCain amendmentI might add this is the third day of the debate on health carereform in America We have yet to vote on a single amendment becausethe Republicans refuse to allow us to bring an amendment to the floorfor a vote How can you have an honest debate about a bill of thisseriousness and magnitude if you cannot bring a measure to a vote onthe floorThose who follow the Senate know it is a peculiar institution and itsrules protect minorities and individual Senators can object to a voteThe Republican Senators have objected to a vote even on the MCCainamendment which I believe was filed on Monday and here we are onWednesday We have talked about it We know what is in it We shouldvote on it But the Republicans do not want to vote on it They want todrag this out in the hopes that our desire to go home for Christmasmeans we will walk away from health care reformWell if a few of the Republican Senators could have just left theDemocratic caucus they would know better We are determined to bringthis bill to a vote We are determined to bring real health care reformto this country We know what is at stakeThe current health care system in America is not affordable for mostAmericans Health insurance premiums have gone up dramatically in costIndividuals cannot afford to buy a policy Businesses are droppingcoverage of their employees We know the costs are unsustainableUnless we start bringing those costs down this great health caresystem is going to collapse We need to preserve the things that aregood in this system and fix those that are broken Affordability is thefirst thing we need to address The second thing we need to addressquite obviously is to make sure every American has the right as aconsumer to get coverage when they need itHow many times have you heard the story of people who pay theirhealth insurance premiums their whole lives then somebody gets sick intheir housea new baby a child your wife your husbanda bigmedical bill is coming you go to the health insurance company and youare in for a battle They will not pay it They say Oh we took a lookat your application you filed a few years ago You failed to disclosethat you had acne when you were an adolescent Am I making that up NoThat is an actual case Because you did not disclose that you had acneas an adolescent you failed to disclose a preexisting condition so wehave no obligation to pay for anything If this sounds farfetchedbelieve me it is an actual caseand there are many others like itPrivate insurance companies have spent a fortune hiring an army ofpeople sitting in front of computer screens talking to the people whoare paying the premiums and above their computers is a sign that saysJust Say No They say no consistently because every time they sayno their profits go up But it leaves individuals and families in aterrible situationdenied coverage because of a preexisting conditiondenied coverage because they could not carry their health insurancepolicy with them after theylost their job denied coverage because of a cap in the amount of moneythe policy would pay rescinded where they walk away from an insurancepolicy because of some objection they have legal objection or howabout one of your kids who turned age 24 no longer covered by yourfamily health plan now out on their own maybe fresh from college andhas no job and no health insuranceThis bill addresses those issues This bill eliminates the concernpeople will have over a preexisting condition It takes away the powerof the health insurance companies to say no It finally creates asituation which we have waited for for a long time America is theonly civilized industrialized country in the world where a person candie for lack of health insurance It does not happen anywhere elseonly in America Madam President 45000 people a year die for lack ofhealth insuranceWho are these people Let me give you an example one person whom Imet Her name is Judie and she works in a motel in southern IllinoisShe is 60 years old a delightful happy woman She is the one whotakes the dishes at the end of this little breakfast they offer at themotel She could not be happier and nicer She is 60 years old withdiabetes She never had health insurance in her lifenever She goesto work every day works 30 hours a week and makes about 12000 ayear She does not have health insurance but she does have diabetesShe said to me If I had health insurance I would go to the doctor Ihave had some lumps that have concerned me for a little while here butI cant afford it SenatorThat is an example of a person who does not have the benefit ofhealth insurance This bill we are talking aboutthis bill we aregoing to produce for everyone to read on the Internet it is alreadythere it has been there for 10 days already it will continue to betherethis bill makes sure that 94 percent of the people in Americahave health insurance coverage That is an alltime high for the UnitedStates of AmericaI might also say despite the criticismsand they are entitled to becritical on the Republican side of the aislethey have yet to answerthe most basic criticism I have offered Where is your bill Where isthe Republican health care reform bill They cannot answer thatquestion because it does not exist They have had a year to exploretheir ideas and develop them but they have failed They cannot producea bill They are for the current system as it exists that isunsustainable unaffordable leaving too many Americans vulnerable tohealth insurance companies that say no and too many Americans withouthealth insuranceI wish to address one particular issue that seems to come up all thetime and it is the issue of medical malpractice I know my Republicancolleagues are going to bring up that issue Senator MCCain has manyothers have as well President Obama recently recognized this as anissue of concern Our bill will as well We are going to exploreencourage and fund State efforts to find ways to reduce medicalmalpractice premiums and to reduce even more importantly theincidence of medical errorsMedical malpractice reform proposals are based in States The FederalGovernment does not have a medical malpractice law not in generalterms It does for specific programs such as Indian health care forexample or federally qualified clinics But when it comes to thegeneral practice of medicine that is governed by State laws and theStates decide when you can sue what you can sue for and theprocedures you have to followIn almost every State there has been a system that has developed overthe years to handle these cases States regularly change and updatetheir laws The States try to strike a balance to protect patientspreserve their hospitals and doctors and other medical providersensure that those who are injured have a chance for compensation andmanage the cost of their systemAt least twentyeight States as of last year have decided to imposecaps on noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases A long timeago before I came to Congress I used to be a practicing lawyer inSpringfield IL and I handled medical malpractice cases So I do notprofess to be an expert nor even have current knowledge of medicalmalpractice but I did in a previous life have some experience Idefended doctors when they were sued for a number of years on behalfof insurance companies and I represented plaintiffs who were victimsof medical negligence So I have been on both sides of the table Ihave been in the courtroom I have gone through the processHere is what it comes down to If you are a victim of medicalmalpractice medical negligence the jury can give you an award whichusually includes a number of possibilities pay your medical bills payfor any lost wages pay for any additional expenses that may beassociated with the court case and pay for pain and suffering Thoseare the basic elements that are involved in a medical malpracticelawsuitThe pain and suffering part of itit is pain suffering loss of aspouse or child loss of fertility scars and disfigurementis anarea where many States have said We want to limit the amount you canrecover for pain and suffering what they call noneconomic losses Itis not medical bills It is not lost wages So my State for examplehas a limitation of 500000 on noneconomic damages in a medicalmalpractice case recently enacted by our general assembly In theState of Texas it is 250000 Those are socalled caps limitationson the amount of money a jury can award for pain and suffering whenthey find in fact you were a victim of medical negligenceSome States have decided to establish caps on pain and suffering howmuch you can recover others have not The reason many imposed caps wasbecause they wanted to bring down the cost of medical malpracticeinsurance for doctors and hospitals Well a number of States have donethat At least twentyeight States have done that and we have beenable to step back and take a look How did it work If you put a cap alimitation on recovery for pain and suffering noneconomic loss doesthat mean there will be lower malpractice premiums for doctors In somecases yes in some cases noMinnesota is an interesting example Minnesota does not have caps ondamages Yet it has some of the lowest malpractice premiums inAmerica Twentyfive States including Minnesota use a certificate ofmerit system which means before you can file a lawsuit you need amedical professional to sign an affidavit that you have a legitimateclaim before you even get into the court That is in Minnesota it isin Illinois and a number of other States to stop socalled frivolouslawsuitsSome States such as Vermont have low malpractice premiums and donthave any malpractice reforms It is hard to track cause and effect herebetween tort reform malpractice changes and the actual premiumscharged physiciansThere are ways Congress can help States build on what already worksfor each State Senator Baucus who is here on the floor and who ischairman of the Senate Finance Committee has worked with Senator Enzito create incentives for State programs to look for innovative ways toreduce malpractice premiums and the incidence of medical negligence Ithink that is a good idea and I hope it will ultimately be included inthis billOne of the major considerations when it comes to malpractice reformis making sure we focus on real facts One myth we hear over and overagain is about frivolous lawsuits flooding the courts I have heardmany colleagues come to the floor and call it jackpot justicefrivolous lawsuits flybynight lawyers filing medical malpracticelawsuits I am sure there is anecdotal evidence for each and everystatement but when you look at the record you find that malpracticeclaims and lawsuit payouts are actually decreasing in AmericaIn 2008 according to the Kaiser Family Foundation there were 11025paid medical malpractice claims against physicians nationwide One yearin America the total number of medical malpractice claims paidaccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation was 11025 There are990000 doctors in America so roughly 1 percent of doctors is beingcharged with malpracticeand paying each year This is a decrease from 2007 where the number was11478 So the number of malpractice claims has gone down The numberof paid claims for every 1000 physicians has decreased from 252 in1991 to 111 in 2008 That is a little over 1 percent of doctorsactually paying malpractice claimsNot only is the number of claims decreasing but the amount they arepaying to victims is decreasing as well The National Association ofInsurance Commissionersnot a group that is biased one way or theother when it comes to plaintiffs or defendantssaid in 2003malpractice claim payouts peaked at 846 billion In 2008 that numberhad been cut in half In 5 years it went down from 84 billion to 4billion So rather than a flood of frivolous lawsuits fewer lawsuitsare being filed and dramatically less money is being paid outIncidentally the New York Times in a summary of research inSeptember of this year found that only 2 to 3 percent of medicalnegligence incidents actually lead to malpractice claims So it is notcredible to argue that we have this flood of malpractice casestheyare going downor this flood of payouts for malpractice in America Ithas been cut in half in 5 yearsA third key consideration in this debate is cost One of the maingoals of pursuing health care reform is to try to reduce the cost tothe system and we want to try to do that in a way that wont compromisethe quality of care There has been a lot of talk about theCongressional Budget Office report that was ordered up by Senator Hatchon October 9 The Congressional Budget Office for years said they couldnot put a pricetag on medical malpractice reform in terms of savings tothe system but on October 9 they reported to Senator Hatch that theycould Senator Hatch asked them what would be the impact on our healthcare system if we had a Texasstyle cap which is 250000 for pain andsufferingI see the Senator from Texas on the floor and I hope I amquoting the Texas law correctly He was a former Texas supreme courtjustice Am I close  That is all I will get from the Senator fromTexas close But the fact is that Senator Hatch said to the CBO whatif we had the Texasstyle cap on every State in the Union what wouldbe the net result They came back and said there would be a savings ofover 50 billion over the next 10 years They said 40 percent of thesavings would come from lower medical liability premiums 60 percentthrough reduced utilization of health care servicesI dont question the Congressional Budget Office reaching thatconclusion They worked hard to come up with their figures But thereare other ways to reach results they want to achieve of loweringmedical liability premiums and saving overall health care expendituresrather than adopting Federal damage caps Keep in mind these caps onwhat you can recover are for people who have been judged by a jury oftheir peers to have been victims These are not people who have said Ithink I was hurt We are talking about people who have a right torecovery in a lawsuit who are being told even though you were hurt andsomebody did something wrong we are going to limit how much you can bepaid when it comes to these noneconomic lossesThe CBO analysis that Senator Hatch received went on to sayBecause medical malpractice laws exist to allow patients tosue for damages that result from negligent health careimposing limits on that right might be expected to have anegative impact on health outcomesThey cited one study which found that a 10percent reduction in costsrelated to medical malpractice liability would increase the Nationsoverall death rate by 2 percent By calculation that means that if theHatch proposal were applied nationwide according to the CBOand thisis a cited study4853 more Americans would be killed each year bymedical malpracticeor more than 48000 Americans over a 10yearperiod of time that the CBO examines So if you accept their projectionon the savings for medical malpractice reform asked for by SenatorHatch you cannot escape the fact that they say yes you will savemoney but more Americans will die because there will be moremalpracticeLets look at the savings that can be achieved through reducedmalpractice insurance premiums The CBO said a 250000 Federal damagecap would reduce overall malpractice premiums by about 10 percent andwould reduce overall health care spending by 2 percent Do we need afederally mandated cap to achieve that Malpractice insurance premiumsare already going down According to the Medical Liability Monitorscomprehensive survey of premiums in the areas of internal medicinegeneral surgery and OBGYN The most recent three years have shown aleveling and now a reduction in the overall average rate change formedical malpractice premiums There was a time in the early 2000s wheremalpractice premiums were going up 20 percent a year in 2003 2004and 9 percent in 2005 Since then they have gone down each year by lessthan 1 percent in 2006 by 4 percentI am sorry 4 percent increasein 2007 but a 43 percent decrease in 2008 That is without anyFederal cap on damagesLets also consider the issue of defensive medicine Many peopleclaim that doctors do things such as order tests to cover themselvesbecause they are afraid of being sued I agree that there areundoubtedly some doctors who think that way There was a famous articleprinted in the New Yorker where a surgeon from Boston Dr Gawande whowent to MCAllen TXyou probably saw this Senator Cornynand hewanted to know in this article why in MCAllen TX they were payingmore for Medicare patients than any other place in the United StatesSo he visited with doctors and surgeons and hospital administrators toask them why What is peculiar about that city and its elderly peopleHe sat down with the doctors and the first doctor said Well it isdefensive medicine We are doing all of these extra tests and extracosts to Medicare to cover ourselves to protect ourselves The doctorsitting next to him said Oh come on With the Texas law nobody isfiling malpractice lawsuits around here We are doing these extraprocedures because it is a feeforservice system You are paid morewhen you do more So at least in this case there was a dispute as towhether this was truly defensive medicine or overbillingDr Carolyn Clancy the director for the Agency of HealthcareResearch and Quality in the Department of HHS has called medicalerrors a national problem of epidemic proportions According to thatagency the rate of adverse events has risen about 1 percent in each ofthe past 6 years The Institute of Medicine estimated in 1999 that upto 98000 people died in America due to preventable medical errorsThese medical errors cost a lot A 2003 study published in the Journalof the American Medical Association found the medical errors in UShospitals in the year 2000just 1 yearled to approximately 32600deaths 24 million extra days of patient hospitalization and anadditional cost of 93 billionI wish to also say a word about the medical malpractice insurersRemember insurance companies and organized baseball are the only twobusinesses in America exempt from the antitrust laws What it means isthat insurance companies can literally legally sit down and collude andconspire when it comes to the prices they charge and they do Theyhave official organizationsone used to be known as the InsuranceServices Officesthat would sit down to make sure every insurancecompany knew what the other insurance company was charging and theycould literally work out the premiums how much they chargeThe same thing was true in market allocation Insurance companiesunlike any other business in America can pick and choose where theywill do business Company X you take St Louis company Y you takeChicago company Z you get Columbus OH They can do it legallySo the obvious question is If this is not on the square in terms ofreal competition from health insurance companies are these companiesin fact paying out the kind of money they shouldLet me see if I can find a chart here My staff was kind enough tobring these out Well I cant They are great charts but I cant findthe one I am looking for at this momentAccording to the information of the National Association of InsuranceCommissioners in 2008 medical malpractice insurers charged 114billionin premiums but only paid out 41 billion in losses In other wordsthey took in 7 billion more than they paid out in losses That is aloss ratio of 36 percent which means they are basically collecting 3for every 1 they pay outpretty close How does that compare to therest of the insurance industry Well it turns out that privateautomobile liability insurance had a loss ratio of 66 percent a payoutof 2 out of every 3 homeowners 72 percent workers comp insurance65 percent These medical malpractice insurance companies are holdingback premiums and not paying them out It reached a point in my Statewhere our insurance commissioner ordered that they declare a dividendand pay back some of the premiums they had collected from doctors andhospitals when it came to malpractice insuranceBut rather than get lost in statistics as important as they are Ithink it is important that we also talk about the real life storiesthat are involved in medical malpractice I hear these terms such asfrivolous lawsuits and jackpot justice and people takingadvantage of the system but lets not forget the real life storiesthat lie behind medical malpractice Let me show my colleagues apicture here of a couple This is Molly Akers of New Lenox IL alovely young lady with her husband Molly Akers had a swelling in herbreast and went to her doctor who performed a biopsy that showed shehad breast cancer Molly had several mammograms which found no evidenceof a tumor but the doctors decided that despite the mammograms shemust have a rare form of breast cancer They recommended a mastectomyremoving Molly Akers right breast After the operation the doctorcalled her into the office and said that on further review she neveractually had breast cancer The radiologist had made a mistake Hereviewed her slides and accidentally switched Mollys slides withsomeone else Molly was permanently disfigured by an unnecessarysurgery She said afterwardsI never thought something like this could happen to me butI know now that medical malpractice can ruin your lifeBy the way that other woman whose slides were switched with Mollyswas told she was cancer free What a horrific medical error that turnedout to beThis next picture is of Glenn Steinberg of Chicago He went intosurgery for the removal of a tumor in his abdomen Ten days after thesurgery while still in the hospital Glenn was having severegastrointestinal problems The doctors xrayed his abdomen where theoriginal surgery took place and they found a 4inch metal retractorfrom the surgery lodged against his intestine A second surgery wasperformed to remove the metal piece during which Glenns lungsaspirated and he died later that nightGlenns wife Mary Steinberg lost her husband She saidNot a day goes by that I dont miss Glenns companionshipand the joy he brought to our household Because of grossnegligence he was not here to support me when my son wentoff to serve our country in IraqIn this photo is a group of kids including Martin Hartnett ofChicago When Martins mom Donna arrived at the hospital to deliverher labor wasnt progressing Her doctor broke her water and found outthat it was abnormalRather than considering a Csection Donnas doctor started toadminister a drug to induce contractions Six hours later she stillhadnt delivered but her sons fetal monitoring system beganindicating that he was in severe respiratory distress The doctorfinally decided it was time to perform an emergency Csection but itwas another hour before Donna was taken into the operating roomDuring that time the doctor failed to administer oxygen or takeimmediate steps to help Martin breathe After he was born Martin wasin the intensive care unit for 3 weeks Later Donna learned thatMartin had substantial brain damage and cerebral palsya direct resultof the doctors failure to respond to indications of serious oxygendeprivation and delivery in a timely mannerDonnas doctor told her not to have any more children because therewas a serious problem with her DNA which could result in similardisabilities in any of her future kids Since then Donna has givenbirth to three perfectly healthy sonsDonna sued the doctor responsible for Martins delivery and receiveda settlement She is thankful she has money from the settlement to helpcover the costs associated with Martins care that arent covered byhealth insurance such as the wheelchairaccessible van that she boughtfor 50000 and the 100000 she spent making changes to her home soher son can get around the house in a wheelchairWhat would Donna have done without the money from that settlement Itis a scary thought because Martin is going to require a lifetime ofcare When we put caps on recoveries and say there is an absolute limitto how much someone who has created a problem has to pay out we haveto think about it in terms of reallife stories such as MartinsMartin will live for a long time and he is going to need helpSomebody needs to be responsible for that The person who caused thisshould be responsible for it That is pretty basic justice in AmericaWhen you establish an artificial cap on noneconomic losses for painand suffering then you are saying there is a limit to how much can bepaid I recall the case of a woman in Chicago who went into a prominenthospitalone that I have a great deal of respect forto have a moleremoved from her facea very simple mole removal They gave her ageneral anesthesia In the course of that anesthesia they gave heroxygen The oxygen tankin the administration of itcaught fireliterally burning off her face She went through repeatedreconstructive surgeries I have met her There was scarring and asyou can imagine a lot of pain Was 250000 too much money for thatfor what she went through Her life will never be the same That is thekind of disfigurement covered by noneconomic losses that would belimited by medical malpractice capsThere are better ways to do this We can in fact reduce the cost ofmedical malpractice insurance We can in fact reduce medical errorsWe should not do it at the expense of innocent victimspeople who wentin with all the trust in the world to doctors and hospitals and hadunfortunate and tragic resultsEvery time I get up to speak on this subject I always make a point ofsayingand I will todayhow much I respect the medical profession inAmerica There isnt one of us in this Chamber or anyone watchingthis who cant point to men and women in the practice of medicine whoare true heroes in their everyday lives who sacrifice greatly tobecome doctors and who work night and day to get the best results fortheir patients They richly deserve not only our praise but ourrespectBut there are those who make mistakesserious mistakes There areinnocent victims who end up with their lives changed or lost because ofit We cannot forget them in the course of this debate This is aboutmore than dollars and cents It is about justice in this country Iurge my colleagues when the issue of medical malpractice comes beforeus to remember the doctors but not to forget the victims and theirfamiliesI yield the floor  Can the Senator give us an indication of how long heexpects the colloquy to last   President will the Senator from Nevada yield for aquestion before he starts  Could the Chair inform me how much time was used on theRepublican side during the last group of speakers I am going to proceed to speak in thesame manner and yield to the Senator from Vermont Our time will beless than that in totalI see the Senator from Louisiana is here We are going to be speakingless than 42 minutes We guarantee him that much We will follow thesame process if there is no objection that was just followed withthree Republican speakers who spoke in that 42minute period of timeI ask unanimous consent that Senator Sanders be recognized after meto speak and that our total time be no more than 42 minutes  President I just offered that to the Republicanside and they asked me for permission and I gave permission unanimousconsentWe will speak as long as we like We will enter into a colloquy Ihope the Senator from Louisiana will reconsiderLet me try to address a few of the issues that have been raised onthe Senate floor First on the issue of medical malpractice this isan issue often brought up on the other side of the aisleThe first thing I would like to say is this is the bill we aredebating It is 2074 pages and one extra page makes it 2075 pages Ithas taken us a year to put this together There have been a series ofcommittee hearings that have led to the creation of this legislationIt has been posted on the Web site for anyone interested If they go toGoogle for example and put in Senate Democrats they will be ledto a Web site which will let them read every word of this bill It hasnow been out there for 12 days at least and it will continue to bethere for review by anyone interestedIf you then Google Senate Republicans and go to their Web site onhealth care and look for the Senate Republican health care reform billyou will findthis bill the Democratic bill because there is noSenate Republican health care bill For a year and with an enormousnumber of speeches they have come to the floor and talked about healthcare but have never sat down and prepared a bill to deal with thehealth care system which leads us to several conclusionsThis is hard work and they have not engaged in that hard work It iseasier to be critical of this work product They have chosen thatroute That is their right to do This is the Senate We are themajority party We are trying to move through a bill But all of theideas they have talked about tonight and other evenings have notresulted in a billSecond it may be that they do not want to see a change in thecurrent system they are happy with the health care system as it existstoday That is possible In fact I think it drives some of them to thepoint where they criticize our bill but do not want to change thesystem because they like itI guess there are some things to like about it There are goodhospitals and doctors in America Some people are doing very well withthe current system But we also know there are some big problems Weknow the current system is not affordable We know the cost of healthinsurance has gone up 131 percent in the last 10 years that 10 yearsago a family of four paid about 6000 a year for health insurance Nowthat is up to 12000 a year We anticipate in 8 years or so it will beup to 24000 a year Roughly 40 percent or more of a persons grossincome will be paid in health insuranceThat is absolutely unsustainable So businesses are unable to offerhealth insurance as well as individuals are unable to buy healthinsurance The Republicans have not proposed anything nothing thatwill make health insurance more affordable This bill addresses thatissue They have nothingSecond we know there are about 50 million Americans without healthinsurance These are people who work for businesses that cannot affordto offer a benefits package They are people who are recentlyunemployed and they are people in such lowincome categories theycannot afford to buy their own health insurance and their children50million This bill we have before us will give coverage to 94 percentof the people in America the largest percentage of people insured inthe history of our countryThe Republicans have failed to produce a bill that expands coveragefor anyone in America Under the Republican approach nothing would bedone to help the 50 million uninsuredThe third issue is one about health insurance companies Everybodyhas an experience there It is unfortunately not good for mostbecause when you pay premiums all your life and then need the healthinsurance many times it is not there What we do is give consumersbargaining power and a fighting chance with health insurance That tome is a reasonable approach It eliminates discrimination againstpeople because of a preexisting condition and putting caps on theamount of money that is being paid We extend the coverage for childrenunder family health plans from age 24 to age 26 We do things that givepeople peace of mind that when they need health insurance forthemselves and their family it will be thereThe Republicans fail to offer anything that deals with healthinsurance reform That is a fact They have said a lot about MedicareI would like to tell you that tomorrow or soon I will becosponsoring and Senator Bennet of Colorado will be offering anamendment which could not be clearer on the issue of this bill and theMedicare Program The amendment is so short and brief and direct andunderstandable I want to read a couple of highlightsNothing in the provisions of or amendments made by thisAct shall result in the reduction of guaranteed benefitsunder title XVIII of the Social Security ActThat is Medicare What Senator Bennet is saying is that people willhave their Medicare benefits guaranteed Nothing in this bill willinfringe on their Medicare benefits despite everything that has beensaidThe Bennet amendment goes on to saySavings generated for the Medicare program under titleXVIII of the Social Security Act under the provisions of andamendments made by this Act shall extend the solvency of theMedicare trust funds reduce Medicare premiums and othercostsharing for beneficiaries and improve or expandguaranteed Medicare benefits and protect access to MedicareprovidersAll of the speeches made in the last 3 days about how this billthreatens Medicareit does notwill be completely cleared up by theBennet amendment I hope some Republicans who have a newfound love ofthe Medicare Program which was started many years ago will join us invoting for this amendment It would be great to see if their speechesto save Medicare will result in their votes for the Bennet amendmentThis is a critically important amendment I commend him for being sostraightforward and showing real leadership on an issue of thismagnitudeI know the Senator from Vermont is interested in speaking I amprepared to yield for comments and questions Before I do I wish tosay by way of introduction that we heard one of our Republicancolleagues say this is a singlepayer bill that at the end of the daywe will have created a singlepayer system I think the Senator fromVermont is familiar with the concept of single payer and I wouldinvite his comments or questions through the Chair to me about hisfeelings on this issue  In response to the Senator from Vermont we must dobetter This is the only civilized developed industrialized countryin the world where a person can literally die because they dont havehealth insurance Fortyfive thousand people a year die because theydont have health insurance What does that mean One illustration Ifyou had a 5000 copay on your health insurance policyand people facethatand you go to the doctor and the doctor says Durbin we thinkyou need a colonoscopy and I realize I have to pay the first 5000and the colonoscopy is going to cost 3000 and I say I am going toskip itwhich people do and bad things happenI develop colon cancerand die my insurance has failed me Basic preventive care is notthere We are the only civilized developed country where that is afact  A lady I met 2 weeks ago in southern Illinois 60 yearsold a hostess at a hotel who serves breakfast in the morningthey arethere as we travel around our Stateshas never had health insurance inher life is diabetic and told me that her income is so low 12000 ayear she could not afford to go to a physician to check out some lumpsshe had discovered That is the reality of the current health caresystem in the wealthiest greatest Nation on Earth  President I certainly agree with the Senator fromVermont I would add one more statistic Of the nearly 1 million peoplefiling for bankruptcy in America each year because of health carecosts medical bills they cant pay threefourths of them have healthinsurance Threefourths of them were paying premiums These were thepeople turned down when they needed coverage These were the people whoran into caps on coverage on their policies These are folks who had tobattle it out and lost the battle with the insurance companies to tryto get lifesaving drugs That is the reality of the current systemThe fact is the Republican side of the aisle has not produced analternative We have We have worked long and hard to do it They havenot  We are sent many books and some of them I have achance to glance at This is the recent one I received entitled Bendthe Health Care Trend They have here information which saysAmerican health care spending reached 24 trillion in 2008 and willexceed 4 trillion by 2018 We expect a doubling of basic healthinsurance premiums in 8 to 10 years and we know what you justdescribed is reality Even businesses owned by a couple a husband andwife are finding themselves not only unable to provide healthinsurance for their employees because of its cost they cant coverthemselvesI had a friend of mine one of my boyhood friends I grew up with himand his wife His small business had one of their employees under thehealth insurance plan and his wife had a baby with a serious illnessAs a result their premiums went through the roof He had to cancel hisgroup health insurance He had to cancel the insurance he gave to hisemployees He gave his employees the 300 a month whatever itwas they were paying and said We are all on our own now We have togo in the private market The couple with the sick baby couldnt findany health insurance My friend who was in his 60s and his wife arein a pitched battle every year about how much they have to pay forhealth insurance and the company the only one that will cover themeach year excludes whatever they turned a claim in for last year Sothat is the reality of health insurance for small businessesI also want to tell my friend from Vermont about onethird of allrealtors in America are uninsured have no health insurance They areindependent contractors and they have no health insurance one out ofthree  I would say to those who call our plana singlepayer plan what we are trying to do is to get fair treatmentfrom private health insurance companies for consumers and familiesacross America and to give them choices The Senator from Vermont Iassume is part of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program So amI Most Members of Congress belong to the program Eight millionFederal employees and Members of Congress are part of this program Itmay be the best health insurance in America And we can shop I justgot a notice in the mail that says open enrollment is coming If youdont like the way you were treated by your health insurance plan lastyear you can change You can pick a new one If it is a generous planmore money will be taken out of your check If it is not less moneywill be taken out We can shop What we do on the insurance exchangesin this bill is say to these Americans who wouldnt otherwise haveoptions go shopping Find the best health insurance plan for yourfamily Exercise your choiceI would say to Senator Harry Reid who drafted this bill I thank himfor his hard work He includes a public option a notforprofit healthinsurance plan with lower costs that people can choose if they careto Giving people that choice giving them an option to go shopping forthe most affordable best health insurance plan is what we enjoy asMembers of Congress and what every American family should  I say to my colleague from Vermont I am waiting for thefirst Republican Senator to offer an amendment to this bill to abolishMedicare If they really believe that government health insurance issuch a bad idea they ought to step right up and show it  There is another way that Senators who loathe the idea ofgovernmentrun health insurance plans can show personally theircommitment to that idea by coming to the floor and publicly announcingthey will not participate in the Federal Employees Health BenefitProgram which provides health insurance for Members of Congress I haveyet to hear the first Member critical of government health plans comeforward and say So in a show of unity and personal commitment I amgoing to opt out  I think you will heara lot of speeches about socialized medicine socialism and the bigreach of governmentWhen it comes right down to it there is not a single Member from theother side who stepped up and said Therefore I will offer anamendment to abolish it They will have their chance in this bill andif they want to they can I do not think the people who have thiscoverage today would like to see it gone  Reserving the right to object the staff advises me thatthey are reaching out to Senator Mikulski at this moment I dont knowif we can be in contact with her this evening but I would ask theSenator from Louisiana if he would consider allowing us to go forwardwith this unanimous consent request and hope we can still modify ittomorrow if there is an agreement with Senator Mikulski at that pointI dont think that jeopardizes the right of the Senator from Louisianato offer this at a later time during the course of this debateBased on that I would continue to object  The Senator from Vermont has been a leader on thisissue I can recall when President Obama came forward with his stimulusbill the recovery and reinvestment bill that the Senator from Vermontwas one of the leaders to put additional funds in the bill to buildclinics all across Americain rural areas we represent in the townsand cities we represent as wellfor the very reason the Senatormentioned Because for a lot of people who I represent in downstatesouthern Illinois in some of the rural regions it is a long drive toa doctors clinic for primary care So these community health clinicsFHQA clinics are going to offer people primary careI think as a result of this bill when we enact itand I feel verygood about the enactment of this because I think we sense this is amoment in history we should not misswe are going to see this networkgrow across America And it has proven itself to be so goodIn the city of Chicago I have visited these community healthclinics I will bet the Senator does in Vermont What I find theremany times I will walk in the door The administrator will be there Wewill start talking I will meet the doctors I will meet the nursesWhen I finally get a chance to drink a cup of coffee and talk to themfor a few minutes I sayand I mean itif I were sick I would feelconfident walking into the front door of this clinic that I would bein the best of handsbetter than the most expensive clinic in myState   I might say the Senator from Vermont has also raised animportant issue We know we are going to need more primary carephysicians so there are provisions in this bill to encourage youngpeople to pursue primary careinternists family practitionersbecause those are the frontline people who are needed more frequentlyfor preventive care and basic checkups so people have a chance to seea good doctor before they get sick or become seriously ill and it ismuch more expensive  So we are pushing forward for more and more health careprofessionals Again the Republican critics of this legislation haveoffered nothingnothingwhen it comes to encouraging the growth inthe number of our health care workers in America This ought to besomething that is nonpartisan I would think that at some point theywould agree that many things in here are essential for the future ofour country I think that is one of them  I would say wehave some of the best health care in America but also the mostexpensive health care in America We spend more per person than anyother nation on Earth and a lot of it has to do with money not beingwell spent People who do not have access to a medical home which weestablish in this bill people who do not have access to a communityhealth care clinic in desperation will take a baby with a high feverin to an emergency room  Oncethere they will have the most expensive care they could ever facewhen they could have gone for a doctors appointment  That isnot good for the hospitals because many of them are giving charity carethey do not get compensated for and they pass that cost along to otherpatients and it certainly is not good for the families involved   I am not sure I would support or oppose the amendmentoffered by the Senator from Louisiana but this matter has been on thefloor now for 3 days I say to the Senator there is a pendingamendment here on your side of the aisle from Senator Murkowski on thisissue and I would hope that the Senator has approached her toincorporate his language I do not know if the Senator approachedSenator Mikulski But at this point we think we have some effort beingmade at fairness on both sides that there will be Democraticamendments and Republican amendments both offeredMikulski andMurkowski and MCCain and Bennetand so I would object because Ibelieve we have the basis for a fair agreement at this point  President reserving the right to object may Isuggest to my friend from Louisiana would you consider approachingSenators Mikulski andor Murkowski the first thing

S_LA_VITTER,2009-12-02,  President I rise to talk about a very importanttopic on the floor right now along with the Medicare issue that ispreventive screenings and services particularly for women I want tofocus on a very specific and important example of that which is breastcancer screening through mammography and also through the practice ofselfexaminationThis is very timely because 2 weeks ago a US governmentendorsedpanel issued new recommendations on this topic which I believe alongwith tens of millions of Americans is a major step in the wrongdirection I think we need to focus on this recent action and talkabout this and fix it in the context of this health care reform debateWhat am I talking about Well on Tuesday November 17literallyjust a couple weeks agothe US Preventive Services Task Force whichis an official governmentsanctioned bodya task force aboutpreventive medicineissued new recommendations regarding breast cancerscreening for women including the use of mammographyThese new recommendations they came out with a couple weeks ago are abig step backward a big retrenchment in terms of what the currentstate of knowledge is and what their previous recommendations wereTheir new recommendations just out 2 weeks ago do four things thattake a big step back on breast cancer screeningNo 1 for women between the ages of 40 and 49 rather than get aroutine mammogram every 2 years to screen for breast cancer the taskforce said Forget about that We do not recommend that anymore Westep back from that recommendationNo 2 for women aged 50 to 74 the previous recommendation was toget a routine mammogram to screen against breast cancer every year Thetask force 2 weeks ago stepped back from that and said No everyother year is probably good enough So not every year every otheryearNo 3 for women over the age of 75 the previous recommendation wasto have routine screening at least every 2 years The newrecommendation from the task force steps back from that and says Nowe do not recommend routine screening over the age of 75And No 4 the task force 2 weeks ago said We no longer recommendbreast selfexamination by women to detect lumps to get treatmentearly We do not believe in that We do not think the science is clearon that We step back from thatThose are four huge changes in their previous recommendations Thoseare four huge new recommendations completely at odds with what Ibelieve is the clear consensus in the medical community and thetreatment communityWhen I first read about these new US Preventive Services Task Forcerecommendations around November 17 I had the immediate reaction Ijust enunciated but I said I am not an expert I am not a doctor Iam not a medical expert I want to hear from folks who are much closerto this crucial issue than me So my wife and I convened a roundtablediscussion in Baton Rouge LA We had it on Monday November 23 It wasat the Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center They were very kind to host itIt was cohosted by Womens Hospital in Baton Rouge We had a greatroundtable discussion featuring a lot of different people includingoncologists other MDs other medical experts and including maybemost importantly several breast cancer survivors who literally livedthrough this issue themselves Those breast cancer survivors were allwomen who got breast cancer and had it detected relatively early intheir forties So they are exactly the group of people these newrecommendations would work against because the new recommendations saydont get regular mammography screening in your fortiesAgain I was interested in hearing from the real experts bothmedical experts and the survivors what they thought about it I wasntvery surprised quite frankly when they all had exactly the samereaction I did to these new US Preventive Service Task Forcerecommendations Everybody to a person said this is a big stepbackward This will make us move in the wrong direction Increasedscreening early detection is a leading reason we are winningincreasingly the fight against breast cancer It is a leading reason weare doing so much better in this fightIn that one room at the Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center in a sensewe had a snapshot through history and proof of the great gains we havemade including through early screening because as I said we hadthese survivors all a supercause for celebration Folks who haddetected their cancer most of them relatively early all of them firstgot it and detected it either in their forties or some in theirthirties Unfortunately in the same room we had a life experience onthe other end of the spectrum going back 40plus years That is my wifeWendy who lost her mother to breast cancer when she was 6 years oldOne of the reasons is simple and straightforward and directly relatedto what we are talking aboutBack in the late 1960s when Wendy lost her mom to breast cancer therewasnt this same routine There wasnt this emphasis on screeningThere wasnt the recommendation for annual mammograms There wasnt theeducational push for selfexamination There wasnt that focus andbecause of that far more women tragically including Wendys motherdiedWe have made huge progress since then Again the very lifeexperiences in that one room in Baton Rouge proved that The medicaldoctors and the oncologists the other experts as well as the breastcancer survivors all made that pointSo I am standing on the Senate floor to urge us to take focusedspecific action to legislatively repeal any impact of these newrecommendations by the US Preventive Services Task Force issued inNovemberThis topic is on the Senate floor It is on the floor through theMikulski amendment There is probably going to be a Republicanalternative to that Mikulski amendment My concern is in terms ofeverything on the floor now none of it directly specifically takesback the impact of those new recommendations I think that is the firstmatter we should all come together on 100 to nothing on this topicWe can have a broader debate We can have differences about the bestapproach to prevention and screening But the first concrete focusedthing we should do right now on the Senate floor today is cometogether 100 to nothing to legislatively overrule any impact of thosenew recommendations That is again what I have been hearing fromexperts not just in Baton Rouge not just in that one room but acrossthe country experts in terms of oncologists other medical doctorsleaders of the cancer associations across the country and perhaps mostimportantly breast cancer survivors I daresay that is what everyMember of this body has heard from their States since those newrecommendations came out around November 17So again whatever we do in this broader debate I have a verysimple basic focused suggestion Lets show the American people wecan come together around something on which I believe we all agreeThere is an expression It is mom and apple pie Well this should beconsidered mom and apple pie because it is literally about mom and ourwives and our daughters and obviously half the population So letscome together around this issue and lets legislatively overrule anylegal impact any legal consequence of these new task forcerecommendations of the US Preventive Service Task ForceThat is what my Vitter amendment No 2808 does I had hoped theamendments on the Senate floor on this general topic would do thatalready Unfortunately the one that is pending now at least theMikulski amendment does not do that In fact in some ways it pointsto the new recommendations of the task force and holds up those newrecommendations Our current law holds up the current recommendationsI think because the new recommendations they promulgated aroundNovember 17 are so egregious such a bad idea because the consensusaround the country starting with experts and oncologists is so clearthat we should negate any impact of them So again my Vitteramendment No 2808 which is currently filed as a seconddegreeamendment to the Mikulski amendment would do thatLet me be perfectly clear and read my text because it is very shortFor the purposes of this Act and for the purposes of anyother provision of law the current recommendations of theUnited States Preventive Service Task Force regarding breastcancer screening mammography and prevention shall beconsidered the most current other than those issued in oraround November 2009So what it does is simple It says we are erasing we are cancelingout any effect of those new recommendations made by the task force inand around November 2009 We are saying that never happened because theconsensus is so clear against itAgain I expected the Mikulski amendment to do that directly Itdoesnt do that It does other things about prevention which is fineWe can debate those points We can have a discussion about that But Ithink we need to all come together to absolutely categoricallyspecifically legislatively take back overrule these newrecommendationsI am certainly eager to work with everyone in this body starting withSenator Mikulski starting with Senator Murkowski whom I believe mayoffer a Republican alternative to include this language I hope thislanguage which seems to me is a nobrainer given the consensus on thetopic can be included in both of those amendments It should be justaccepted and included in the Mikulski amendment It should be acceptedand included in the Murkowski amendment That would be my goal so thatwhatever happens on these votes we come together in a unified wayLiterally it would in essence be 100 to nothing to say No time outThese new recommendations of the US Preventive Services Task Forcefrom November ofthis year are a huge step backwards a huge mistake That is what theexperts are saying That is what oncologists are saying That is whatcancer specialists are saying That is what leaders of cancerassociations are saying That is what perhaps most importantly breastcancer survivors are sayingWe can look at history in this country in the last several decadesand happily point to real progress in this fight One of the causes ofthat good news that improvement since the late 1960s when my wifeWendys mom passed away from breast cancer clearly one of theunderlying reasons clearly one of the leading causes is dramaticimprovement in this prevention and screening using mammography alsoeducating about selfexaminationSo again I have this seconddegree amendment My hope and my goalwould be that this language which should be noncontroversial would beaccepted on it as well as any Republican alternative and thatwhatever happens in terms of those votes we come together and makecrystalclear that this task force of unelected bureaucratsdidntinclude a single oncologist by the waymade a big mistake and we aregoing to make sure those new recommendations dont have any impact interms of law in terms of government programs in terms of legal impacton insurance companiesAgain I look forward to working with everyone on the floorincluding Senator Mikulski including Senator Murkowski and others topass this language It should be a nobrainer It is mom and apple pieLets pass it and at least in this focused way come together and do theright thing in direct reaction to something that just happened 2 weeksagoThank you Mr President I yield the floor  Mr President I certainly concur with the distinguished majoritywhips goal of more amendments and more votesWith regard to this very important screening and mammography issuemy goal has been a very focused one I have a filed seconddegreeamendment that has a very simple focused objective which I believe isextremely noncontroversial I believe it would be supported by everyonein this body and that is simply to ensure that there is no legal forceand effect to the recent recommendations issued in November of 2009 bythe US Preventative Services Task Force with regard to breast cancerscreening use of mammography and selfexaminationAs everyone knows those new recommendations were shocking in thatthey took a giant step back from the previous recommendations and tooka giant step back in terms of recommended screening which virtuallyevery expert I know of strongly disagrees withSo this filed simple seconddegree amendment simply says that thosenew recommendations of November of this year have no force and effectI will read the amendment It is very short To be clear it doesnothing more than thatFor the purposes of this Act and for the purposes of anyother provision of law the current recommendations of theUnited States Preventive Service Task Force regarding breastcancer screening mammography and prevention shall beconsidered the most current other than those issued in oraround November 2009So we are simply ensuring that those new recommendationswhich Istrongly disagree with experts strongly disagree with I believe allof my colleagues dohave no legal force and effect So I would simplyask that the unanimous consent proposed be modified so that theMikulski amendment incorporates this language I would propose that asan alternative unanimous consent request  I am verydisappointed about objecting to this important and what should benoncontroversial provision I would suggest another solution which isto take the unanimous consent request on the floor and modify it sothere is simply a vote on this seconddegree amendment amendment No2808 immediately before the vote on the Mikulski amendment  President reserving my right to object again I amvery disappointed to hear that I have approached both sides SenatorMurkowski has incorporated similar language and I was hoping we couldcome together 100 to nothing to actually pass this on to the billwhichever alternative tomorrow is voted upand maybe they both willbebut whichever is voted up or whichever is voted down I think it isvery important to come together and state that we dont want these newtask force recommendations to have any force and effectSo let me propose a third and final alternative unanimous consentrequest that at any point after these votes but before cloture isfiled on the pending matter this amendment No 2808 receive a vote onthe Senate floor as a firstdegree amendment to the underlying bill  President if I could  President reserving my right to object just so Ican respond directly I didnt mean to cut the Senator off If he hasany further statement I will be happy to listen to it But just so Ican respond directly the first thing today I approached both thoseMembers and everyone involved in this debate about this language andcertainly the majority side has had this language for at least 712hours The equivalent of this language has been incorporated into theMurkowski amendment but my hope is that the same thing be accepted inthe Mikulski amendment because it is not clear which is going to beadopted I dont see the great controversy here So that was my hopeAnd that is why I approached those two Senators and the majority side712 hours ago about it with specific languageSo I renew my last unanimous consent request I made in that spirit  President reserving the right to object merely torespond through the Chair I would say I have been working in thatspirit I have given the language to the majority side I have beenworking both at the staff level and Member level with many folks Thisshould be noncontroversial I dont know of any Senator who disagreeswith this So I will accept that offer I will not object to thispending unanimous consent but I truly hope the offer is made in goodfaith because I believe when anyone reads this language they willagree with itAgain it simply says these latest recommendations by the USPreventive Services Task Force made 2 weeks ago will not have anylegal force and effect I believe all of uscertainly it is myimpression and I guess we will find out tomorrow morningI believeall of us want to stop them from having force and effect because it isa great step backward in terms of breast cancer screening andmammography and even education about selfexaminationSo I certainly take that offer and look forward to the majority siderereading this language and hopefully accepting it tomorrow morningbecause I cant imagine on substantive grounds objecting to thelanguageThank you With that I will not object
S_MN_FRANKEN,2009-12-05, President I ask unanimous consent to speak as inmorning business for 5 minutes  I do have the microphone and I thank you for the 16secondsI would like to nowoh I have used it upI yield my time  Madam President let me use the 16 seconds I had but useit in a better way so maybe it wont be 2 minutes I was going to talkabout Senator Lincolns amendment to limit tax benefits healthinsurance companies receive on salaries for CEOs but let me just talkabout the nature of this debateMy esteemed colleague from Arizona Senator MCCain quoted RonaldReagan saying facts are stubborn things We just had my distinguishedcolleague from South Dakota say that this bill does not extend for 1day the solvency of Medicare Well according to the Office of theActuary for theCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services it extends it for 5 yearsNow facts are either stubborn things or they arent The Actuary forCMS is either the Actuary for CMS or not You cant have a debate suchas this and throw things around Facts are stubborn things We areentitled to our own opinions We are not entitled to our own facts Youcannot stand up here and wave your arms and say this doesnt extendMedicare 1 minute 1 day when the Actuary for Medicare says the billextends it for 5 yearsI yield the floor  Madam President I actually was kind of feeling badbecause I thought I was going to be changing the subject when SenatorDurbin said I would be the next Democrat to speak Because our goodcolleague from Nevada brought up an amendment on medical malpracticeliability and the Senator from Illinois responded to it and I thoughtthe Senator from Nevada was going to respond to his response with somefactual information or something he completely changed the subject Sohe went from the Canadian system to rationing and he will include hisentire statement which included this We dont ration care here in theUnited States we letmeaning the governmentwe let the privatesector do thatThey do a great job of rationing care in the private sector That iswhere we ration care in this country They ration it by cutting offyour insurance when you get sick They ration care by not giving youinsurance if you have a preexisting conditionI wish to speak about an amendment I havethat is why I was going tochange the subjectbut let me talk a little bit about tort reformliability insurance Senator Durbin mentioned Atul Gawande He wrotethat article in the New Yorker Senator Ensign talked about how greatthe tort reform was in Texas MCAllen TX has the most expensivehealth care in the country What kind of progress is that They havethe most draconian medical liability reform In Minnesota we donthave anything such as that We do it for a third of the cost that theydo it for in Texas and with better outcomesThe reason I actually asked for time today is to express my supportfor Senator Lincolns amendment to limit the tax benefits that healthinsurance CEOs receivenot limit their salaries limit the taxbenefits This does not limit their compensation as was claimed by theSenator from NevadaMost Americans would agree that the government though shouldnt begiving tax breaks to insurance companies for lining the pockets oftheir CEOs at the expense of working families who are forced to paymore and more as their premiums spiral out of control The savings fromremoving this tax deduction in Senator Lincolns amendment will godirectly to our seniors as a direct deposit into the Medicare trustfund This amendment is immensely important because it reinforces oneof our primary goals with this bill which is to rein in the cost ofhealth care One of the key ways we can control costs is by holdinginsurance companies accountableI am pleased to be working with Senator Lincoln on another effort tomake our health care system focused on patients not profitsYesterday Senator Lincoln joined me Senator Rockefeller and othersin introducing an amendment to require that at least 90 percent of yourpremium dollars go toward actual health services We do that inMinnesota We do that in Minnesota91 cents actuallyI urge my colleagues to support both our amendments to ensure we getthe highest possible value for our premium dollars because nobody cancontest the fact that forprofit health insurance companies have beenmaking obscene amounts of money while Americans watch their premiumsskyrocket From 2000 to 2007 insurance company profits rose 428percentin 8 years During that same time we saw more than 6 millionmore Americans become uninsured During that same period Americanfamilies saw their premiums almost doubleSo nobody can stand on this floor and argue that American familiesarent suffering No one can dispute what I hear from Minnesotans everyday that in this economic downturn one of the greatest fears familieshave is What happens if I get sick What happens if my spouse or mychild gets sick We are hardly holding on now We are just one illnessaway from losing everything That is what I hear That is what I hearfrom Minnesota families and this is a State that has lessexpensivehigher quality health care than the rest of the country If Minnesotansare struggling we know we have a crisis on our handsThat is why I am working to make sure this bill does everything itcan to bring down costs improve quality and hold private insurancecompanies accountableThe current reality is most of us dont know where our healthinsurance premiums go It is difficult enough to understand a billingstatement from your health insurer much less track where your money isspent Well we are going to change that We are going to change thatwith transparent reporting of how health insurance companies arespending your money That is in this bill Clear reporting written inplain English will help us hold them accountable for every dollar wespend on health insurance But reporting isnt enough because rightnow some of the health insurance plans being marketed and sold in thiscountry are nothing short of a ripoffA recent report in BusinessWeek magazine described a policy beingsold in Florida to college students in which only 10 percent of thepremium went toward actual health services Again only 10 cents out ofevery dollar goes to health care in this plan The rest goes tomarketing wasteful administrative costs and of course profits Andthis is legal It has been legal It was legal when the Republicans hadthe White House and controlled this Congress We are going to make itillegalI dont think this is what we want for our childreninsurancecompanies pocketing millions of dollars at the expense of our physicaland economic health Is that the kind of country we want to be Ibelieve we can all agree this health care reform bill must guaranteethat Americans get value for the premiums we payI implore my colleagues to support these efforts because healthinsurance should be about providing the best possible health care notabout marketing wasteful administrative costs CEO pay and profitsMadam President I yield the floorThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from New Jersey isrecognized  Madam President I rise today to talk about Shane BauerSarah Shourd and Josh Fattal These three young Americans have been incustody in Iran since July 31 2009 That is more than 4 monthsShane is from Minnesota where his devoted mother Cindy Hickeystill lives I have been in constant and close touch with Cindy overthe phone and last month I was able to meet with all the families ofthe young hikers and they have been back in Washington again thisweek I have to say they are a remarkable group of people who wantnothing more than to be reunited with their children On behalf oftheir families I have come to the floor today to urge the Governmentof Iran to make a humanitarian gesture and release these youngAmericans so they can be together with their families againAs many of you know Josh Sarah and Shane were hiking near theIraqiIranian border in a remote region that is famous for a beautifulwaterfall when they were taken into custody by Iranian authorities TheIranians have indicated that the Americans strayed across the border inthis remote region There can be no doubt that it was an accident Fourmonths later Josh Sarah and Shane remain in prison in IranThe Iranian Government has allowed the Swiss Embassy in its capacityas protection power for US interests in Iran to have consular accessto them twice during the time they have been held I hope this willcontinue and continue more regularlyThe Swiss have been enormously helpful in working with us to resolvethe situation to bring these Americans home I have been assured by oneof the Swiss that Josh Sarah and Shane were all in decent physicalcondition as of the last visit But it is also clear the imprisonmentis taking its toll on these young peopleThe President of Iran has indicated that their case will be examinedexpeditiously and with compassion which is encouraging PresidentAhmedinejad first made that statement around the time the UN GeneralAssembly met this past SeptemberThese young American tourists find themselves in unfortunatecircumstances One thing is clear These circumstances do and shouldhave nothing to do with politics I hope that Josh Sarah and Shanessituation can be resolved on the same basisas purely a human gestureby the Government of Iran I understand that people on all sides tendto get caught in the middle of geopolitical events they have nothing todo with That is a cycle that can and should be stopped We do not wantto perpetuate that cycle Above all I hope the Iranian Government willrecognize that these Americans have committed nothing more than aninnocent mistake and want nothing more than to be brought back togetherwith their families The Americans should be releasedIn the meantime I hope Josh Sarah and Shane will be able to speakwith their families by phone immediately That would be the firstdirect contact they have had since their detention over 4 months agoAs we approach the holiday season and the end of the year this is anespecially important time for families to be together That is not anAmerican value or an Iranian value it is a human value It is myfervent hope that Josh Sarah and Shane will be brought back togetherwith their families now I urge the Government of Iran to make ahumanitarian gesture and make that family reunion possible
S_IA_HARKIN,2009-12-05, President I ask unanimous consent the order for thequorum call be rescinded President first of all let me say I am glad we areherethis weekend Oh I know we like to be with our families we haveChristmas shopping to do and things such as that It is always nice tobe with our families on the weekends But think about it this wayMillions of Americans today are giving up their weekends they aregiving up their nights their holidays because they are either out ofwork they are working part time they are trying to do odd jobs to getenough money together to keep their families intact So they areworking at nights they are working on weekends They are not takingtime off They are out there looking for work now or out there doingodd jobs whatever they can possibly do They are making sacrificesThey are making sacrifices for their families but they are also makingthese sacrifices to pay their medical bills or to afford their neededprescriptions It seems to me we owe them nothing less than the samelevel of commitment to the task of bringing quality affordable healthcare within their reachOur leader Senator Reid was right to call the Senate into sessionthis weekend We ought to keep at this bill this health care reformbill working hard until the Senate finishes the job before usNothing less will doI do not plan to spend a lot of time on the debate over MedicareAdvantage that we had yesterday However after listening to thecomments yesterday I did want to mention briefly editorials thatappeared in the Des Moines Register The first was published 6 yearsago when the Senate considered the Republican Medicare druglegislation The major element of that bill was to give outrageousbonuses to private health plans in Medicare Advantage In criticizingthat proposal the Register called on Members of Congress to remindthemselves their job is to serve the interests of the people notindustry lobbyistsSadly we didnt heed that call that time 6 years ago InsteadCongress under Republican leadership at that time enacted a bill thatprovided a massive and unjustified windfall to the insurance industryThe Register revisited the same subject in an editorial this yearMay 31 of this year Here is what they saidCongress encouraged private insurance plans known asMedicare Advantage plans which have cost taxpayers more thancovering seniors in traditional governmentadministeredMedicareCongress should not repeat the mistakes it made in 2003when reforming Medicarecatering to special interests andpushing people into privatesector insurance coverageOur health bill the one we have before us heeds these words Westand up to the special interests that even today are demandingbillions of dollars in taxpayer funds to prop up their inflatedprofits So yesterday was a good day Yesterday we said no to givingthe insurance industry a 120 billion bonus for doing the same job thatMedicare can do for far lessToday we will consider a proposal from Senator Lincoln to say no tothe outrageous salaries that top executives in these companies receiveChief executive officers at the seven leading insurance companies madea combined 1186 million in 2007 alone an average of 119 millioneach Lets compare that to the wages of millions of Americans or theminimum wage For someone making the minimum wage it would take nearly800 years to make what these insurance company executives make in 1yearAgain here is the CEO compensation For United Health Group theymade 29 billion in profit in 2008 and they paid their CEO 94million WellPoint 98 million Aetna 243 million Humana 473million Coventry Health Care 11 million Cigna 44 million Thatis the CEO compensation That probably is not the whole package whenyou consider all the other benefits they get deferred compensation andon and ongolden parachutes all that kind of stuff That is basicallytheir CEO compensation for the yearAs you can see they get paid pretty well and 119 million is theaverage Here is Aetna 24 million a year They had a profit of 13billion that year So they did well their shareholders did well theirCEO did well But how about the consumers the working familiesIn 2003 by the way Aetna this company right here making all thismoney paying their CEO 24 million a yearin 2003 Aetna settled alawsuit You know usually when you settle lawsuits it is because youthink you are going to get hit worse down the line They settled alawsuit brought by who Brought by physicians a whole group ofphysicians brought a class action against Aetna because they had ahistory of shortchanging patient care Aetna settled for 470 millionjust to get away from it in 2003There was not any money to help them afford the coverage patientsneed but they had billions for profits and they had millions forsalariesnothing for working familiesThe reality for working families across America is simply thisInsurance premiums have skyrocketed outpacing the growth in wages overthe same period Quality affordable health care is slipping further andfurther from the grasp of middleclass Americans Between 1999 and2007 the average American worker saw wages increase 29 percentInsurance premiums during that same time rose more than 120 percentThey see the premiums skyrocketing but their health care is slippingawayThere is something else The profit margins of the insurance industrysoared Over the last 7 years the profits of the seven largest publiclytraded health insurance companies increased by 428 percent Profitsincreased by 428 percent from 24 billion to 129 billion Yet lookat what our workers wages went up29 percentNow you begin to understand why people in this country are upset anddiscouraged and outright mad about their lack of health insurancecoverage about the affordability of that coverage and the quality ofthat coverage Yet with all of this money that is going to their CEOsand huge increases in the profits they make our Republican friends onthe other side of the aisle say they still need a Federal handout Theindustry cannot find a dime to bring down prices for consumers but theycan find millions to lobby for more special favorsThe Wall Street Journal reported that the health care industryboosted their efforts in lobbying this year In a quote from the WallStreet JournalOverall the healthcare sector reported a five percentincrease in lobbying expenditures to 133 million making itthe single largest spender on lobbying of the 10 majorindustry sectors tracked by the Center for ResponsivePolitics Healthinsurance companies increased lobbyingactivity by 11 percent to 78 million according to thedataAn increase of 11 percent You wonder why all this health sector thisyear had 133 million in lobbying expenditures I think if I am notmistaken the supposed stated purpose of health insurance is toprotect Americans from the cost of illness Supposedly their purpose isto keep the American people healthy and productive for the benefit ofsociety Yet over some 60 years this industry the health insuranceindustry has transformed itself from an industry that is there to helpyou to an industry that is there to take money from you when you arehealthy and avoid paying your bills when you get sick This is anindustry with armies of actuaries and functionaries whose job is toprevent you from enrolling if you have a preexisting condition It isan industry that looks at the fine details of your medical records whenyou get sick so they can figure out how to cancel your policy and leaveyou high and dry when you need their help the most as has been saidmany times around hereThe majority actually 62 percent of bankruptcies in America isbecause of medical costs and 80 percent of that group had healthinsurance They actually had health insurance but they had to file forbankruptcy becausethey didnt know it but in their contract intheir policy there was some fine print called a rescission clause orthere is fine print in there on terms of their annual or lifetime capswhich most people do not even know are in their policies But when theygot very sick all of a sudden their policy got rescinded which meanswhen it came up for renewal the insurance company didnt renew it andhere you are with an expensive chronic disease or illness such ascancer or heart disease or disability and they cancel your policy Youare left with only one recoursefile for bankruptcyThis is an industry which defines being a victim of domestic violenceas a preexisting condition I spoke about this previously Only inAmerica with this health insurance industry runningeverything in terms of our health care coverage only here would wehave a situation where a woman can be the victim of domestic violencebe battered get medical help go to the hospital perhaps a victim ofdomestic abuse and then later on find that she cant get her policyrenewed because she has a preexisting condition the preexistingcondition of being the victim of domestic violenceYou may think that is outlandish but it is true and it happens Allwe are seeking is competition openness transparency and fairnessThe insurance industry what are they seeking They are seeking topreserve and protect a sweet deal they have been enjoying on the backsof middleclass Americans and seniors The proposal Senator Lincoln isoffering says basically Enough is enough In defense of theiroutlandish salaries the insurance company CEOs cite the difficulty oftheir jobs and the complexity of their tasks The President of theUnited States probably has a pretty difficult job He has a few complextasks to confront There is no reason insurance company CEOs should geta tax break on salaries higher than the Presidents That is exactlywhat the Lincoln amendment doesI thank Senator Lincoln for her commonsense proposal I thinkconsumers across America should know that when they pay their hardearned dollars to cover the soaring cost of premiums they are not justchipping in to pay for the CEOs next new yacht or the newest Mercedesin the driveway In homes across Iowa people are clipping coupons andmaking do with secondhand patching up instead of buying new They havehad to make sacrifice after sacrifice to afford premiums that providecoverage for their health care It is outrageous that their hardearnedcash goes for goldplated salaries and bonuses Senator Lincoln isright to take a stand against these excesses I urge my colleagues tosupport her amendmentThe Lincoln amendment is consistent with a major theme of ourlegislation It is basically standing up to the health insuranceindustry on behalf of consumers Her proposal will add one moreimportant item to the list of benefits our legislation will bring toAmerican patientsAs I said before this bill ends the practice of denying coveragebecause a person has a preexisting medical condition I would wagerprobably every Member of this Senate has some kind of a preexistingcondition of some sort and every one of us could be turned down if wedidnt have the kind of secured program under the Federal employeesprogram Why shouldnt the rest of the American people have the samekind of securityThis legislation ends the lifetime limits and bans unreasonableannual limits Our bill gives young people better options to stay ontheir familys and parents plan until they are age 26 It also endsthe outrageous practice of charging women higher prices for the samepolicy the exact same policy a man gets I can remember during mytown meetings back in August talking about this issue People werestartled to learn that an insurance company can charge a woman up totwice as much for the same policysame age all the same parameterssame occupation same kind of history They can charge a woman up totwice as much as a man for the exact same coverage the exact samepolicy We get rid of that in this bill We do not allow that kind ofdiscrimination in any other kind of industry Why should we allow it inthis industryOur bill provides better options for individuals small businessesfarms for the selfemployed I have said many times the biggestwinners in our health care reform bill are small businesses and theselfemployed Right now they are sort of at the end of their ropeThey have no bargaining power whatsoever Our bill will createexchanges so they will be able to go on the exchange and pool withother people for more options more competition more transparencyavailableSome places in Iowa we have only one insurance company offeringpolicies There is absolutely no competition Setting up the exchangeswill allow our selfemployed and small businesses to get morebargaining powerThese are the kinds of measures the American people want and need tomake sure they get a fair deal on the coverage they buy We need ahealth insurance industry that is a partner for employers and ordinaryAmericans charges fair premiums treats us right and pays our billswhen we get sick That is what our bill is all about It is to end alot of these outrageous practices that have gone on for far too long inthe health insurance industryA lot of times people say You are always beating up on the healthinsurance industry Not really We are just taking them to task forwhere they have gone Years ago when they first started out they weredoing a good job Then the greed the normal human nature and greed formore profits higher CEO salaries 24 million salaries for CEOs goldplated benefits packages for all their CEOs and corporate executivesit just got out of hand It became a situation where almost one healthinsurance company was trying to outdo the others in terms of how muchmoney they could squeeze out of the consumers It is just a system thatsort of ran amokNow it is up to us in the Congress to rein it in to make the healthinsurance industry what it ought to bea fair and reasonablecompetitive system for the consumers That is what this bill does Tome that is the American way That is why we have to stay here on theweekends if we have to If we have to be here today fine andtomorrow fine and all next week fine and next weekend and if wehave to right through the holidaysThe American people are looking to us to get this job done We aregoing to get the job done No matter how much our friends on theRepublican side want to delay delay delay and try to kill this billit is not going to happen This bill is unstoppable because theAmerican people are demanding that we do something about it We areresponding to that and we are going to get the job doneI yield the floor
S_PA_CASEY,2009-12-05, President we gather today on a Saturday which asmany Americans know is rare but it is entirely appropriate andessential that we make sure we spend the time on a weekend to debatethis bill and to get the bill passed I commend the words of SenatorHarkin and his great work over many months on this legislation We aregrateful for his leadership I commend Senator Lincoln on the amendmentwe will vote on today regarding executive compensationI rise to speak about children as this bill affects their livesinparticular the lives of children who are particularly vulnerable Ihave said a number of times in this debate that at the end of thisdebate when the bill is enacted into law we should be able to saythat no child is worse off especially a child who happens to be pooror has special needs That is what I rise to speak of this morningI had a joint resolution a number of months ago that was filedrelating to this bill It was joined in by Senators Dodd Rockefeller Brown Whitehouse and Sanders It was simpleIt basically said what this chart says No child worse off at the endof the debate It is a fundamental principle but I also believe it isa commitment we must keep When we talk about the legislation beforeus we are not talking about some new system We are talking aboutfiguring out a wayand I think we have in the Senateto fix what isbroken and build upon what works I believe that is what we are tryingto doWhen it comes to children we have special considerations and wehave to have unique strategies to make sure they get the best healthcare possible As so many child advocates tell usand it seems likesuch a simple maximchildren are not small adults That is a profoundstatement You cant just take a health care program for adults andoverlay that on the health care that is provided to children Childrenare not small adults They are different The care they get has to bedifferent It has to be tailored and focused on their needs The carethey get especially a child who is vulnerable is determinative oftheir life If we dont provide them the kind of care in the dawn oftheir life as Hubert Humphrey talked about there is very little afterthat we can do to save them or to allow them to reach their fullpotentialThat bright light inside a child if we miss the opportunity to carefor that child will never be the same We have an opportunity in thisdebate and at the end of the debate with the legislation topositively affect the lives of countless American childrenI have some changes I will propose to the Childrens Health InsuranceProgram but I wanted to speak this morning about parts of the billthat speak directly to the needs of at least two vulnerable childrentwo young girls by the name of Hannah and Madeline from PennsylvaniaI will get to their story in a moment but their mother Staciecommunicated with us and a lot of other people about their lives andtheir challenges I did want to first review some of the basic parts ofthe bill We often say this bill contains consumer protections That isa nicesounding phrase but when you talk about consumer protections inthe lives of young children such as Hannah and Madeline it takes on awhole new meaning I will talk more about them in a momentI want to walk through some of the basic provisions in the bill asthey relate to children and what we have in the bill alreadyNo 1 the bill ensures pediatric input into benefit packages so thatthe skill and the knowledge of a pediatrician and the kind of care theycan provide to a child is part of the benefits package Again childrenare not small adults The bill also ensures benefit packages thatinclude pediatric benefits including critical oral and vision healthcareWe all remember the tragedy last year of Diamante Driver of the Stateof Maryland a young boy who lost his life because his family did nothave coverage for an infected tooth and couldnt afford the care Weare talking about a child in America who died from an infected tooththat would have cost 80 to treat This horrible tragedy that everyonein Washington was talking about at the time was entirely preventableWe remembered his story and his tragedy in the bill by making sure thatoral and vision health care are part of what we doIn addition the bill mandates prevention and screenings forchildren It creates pediatric medical homes People say What is amedical home That is not a place It is a way to treat someone so ifan American especially a child has a primary care doctor which manyof them unfortunately dontand that is another part of what we aretrying to dothat primary care doctor should be surrounded by theexpertise we can bring to bear to help the child We have so muchknowledge and wisdom and ability when it comes to our doctors We haveremarkable pediatricians whose sole focus is to help a child in onepart of their needs the health care needs of that child Why shouldnot every child be surrounded by that kind of expertise That is whatwe are trying to doWe strengthen the pediatric workforce We cant just say we need alot of pediatricians and hope it happens We have to make sure we havea workforce and a recruiter workforce to do thatSenator Dodd and I and Senator BrownI know Senator Dodd is on theflooradded a loan repayment provision in the bill for pediatricspecialists and providers for mental health services for childrenI have two more items and then I will get to the story of Hannah andMadelineWe expand drug discounts for childrens hospitals and finallyincrease access to immunizations The CDC will provide grants toimprove immunizations for children and adolescent adultsBut let me talk for a couple momentsI know we have others who arewaiting to talk this morningabout these two children Hannah andMadeline The good news isthis picture is a dramatic depiction ofwhat they were suffering from when they were diagnosed with leukemia atthe age of 4 They are 11 years old now and they are doing better butthey still have enormous challenges in their lives Their mother StacieRitter wrote as followsWhen my identical twins were both diagnosed with a kind ofleukemiaAnd she talks about itat age four we were told they would need a bone marrowtransplant in order to surviveImagine that I have four daughters and I remember when they wereabout the age of 4 I never had to worry about any of this I never hadto even think about it But if my wife and Imy wife Teresa and Iwere given this news we would have been given coverage for a conditionsuch as that by an insurance policy because I happened to be a Stategovernment employee and now I am a Federal Government employee So Inever had to worry about that diagnosis for my daughters Other thanthe challenge of the diagnosis itself I did not have to worry aboutcoverage But Stacie Ritter and her husband Ben did She saysI learned that the insurance company thought my daughterswere only worth 1000000 each It sounds like a lot ofmoney Its notShe says that with an exclamation pointWhen you add up the costs involved in caring for a patientwith a life threatening disease like cancer 1000000 barelycovers itI think that is an understatementFortunately the hospital social worker recommended we applyfor a secondary insurance through the state considering thehighly probable chance we would hit that million dollarcap And we did hit that cap before the end of treatmentThankfully the state program kicked in and helped pay for theremainder of treatmentThe State programit sounds a lot like a public option doesnt itan awful lot like a public option So at least for this part of thestory they were able to get some help through a State program a kindof public option We will talk more about that laterBut then Stacie goes on and the lead headline of this section is oneword BankruptcyDuring this time my husband had to take family medicalleave so we could take turns caring for our one year old sonand our twinsThese twins as shown in these picturesat the hospital    For the 7 months my husband was out onfamily medical leave he was able to maintain his employerbased insurance for us via 11718 a month COBRA paymentsMy recollection is COBRA was an initiative by the Federal Governmentto make sure if you lose your job you do not lose your healthinsurance We have to extend it right nowanother governmentinitiative that was helpful hereAfter spending all our savings to pay the mortgage andother basic living expenses we had to rely on credit cardsSo a mother and a father who get this diagnosis for their children atage 4 have to rely on credit cards to get the help their daughtersneedStacie writesIn the end we had no choice but to file bankruptcy Andwhen you file bankruptcy everything must be disclosed weeven had to hand over the kids savings accounts that theirgreat grandparentsTheir great grandparentshad given them   Is this the kind of system we want when a mother and a father arehit with that diagnosis for their two daughters when they are age 4that we have a system that says Do you know what We have to cap yourcoverage We can help you a little bit but we are going to limit itYou will figure it out Dont worry That is basically what the systemsaid to themSo what are we doing Well we have a bill that happens to speak tothese kinds of situations It is ironicI guess is the wordthat onpage 16 of the bill which is actually the second page of the text wehave a provision that says thisA group health plan and a health insurance issuer offeringgroup or individual health insurance coverage may notestablish    lifetime limits on the dollar value ofbenefits for any participant or beneficiary   It is not complicated It is not legalese It is very specific to thelives of these two children The first provision in the bill says thereare no lifetime limits So you cannot say to Hannah and MadelineSorry we know you have leukemia and we know you need expert care andtreatment but we are going to limit your careSo for those who think this is complicated and difficult in a lot ofdebate here in Washington it is not complicated If we had thisprovision as a matter of law in effect when Stacie got that diagnosisfor her daughters she would not have had to worry about coverage Shewould not have had to use credit cards and go into bankruptcy and takethe savings these children were given by their great grandparentsWhy do we tolerate this system Why do we go year after year andtalk about changing it saying Oh isnt that terrible we have thesesituations and we let it go and we say that is too bad we couldnt getthe bill passed it got a little difficult in WashingtonWell the time for talk and debate and discussing the finer points ofthis is over We have to act to make sure a family such as this neverhas to go through what these parents went through but especially whatthese two young girls went throughI will conclude with this This picture as dramatic as it is Ithink connotes a lot of hope Look at those two young girls facing themost horrific of circumstances and they are smiling and hopeful Butthey still need help We are going to be spending time in the nextcouple days getting this bill done so we can make sure we help them inthe futureWith that I yield the floor
S_MT_BAUCUS,2009-12-05, Will the Senator yield to know what the deal was  Will the Senator yield for another question  A vote for theJohanns amendment is a vote for the status quo What does that mean Itmeans seniors will continue to pay higher and higher premiums highercost sharing due to wasteful overpayments A vote against Johanns meanswe can extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund that helpsbenefitsI think we are for seniors in this body I urge a vote againstJohanns  Does the Senator know that the socalled deal was thatwhereas MedPAC and the administration and the House wanted to makedomestic cuts to home health care but rather we went to the homehealth care industry worked with them and took two of their majorsuggestions about fraud and abuse as well as outliers so we modifiedso that the home health industry thought this was fair and reasonableDoes the Senator know that was the agreement that was reached   Reserving the right to object to be totally candidthese are stunt amendments which we have not seen I have never heardof the amendments  Reserving the right to object because I have not evenseen these amendments I object  Will the Senator yield for a question Will the Senatoryield for a question   Do the Senators realize and do they know that yesterdaythe Home Care and Hospice Association the National Association forHome Care and Hospices the umbrella organization for home health andhospice wrote a letter to me which basically saysFor all of these reasons we support the provisions ofyour health care reform legislation as it relates to homehealth careIs the Senator aware of that letter the Home Care and HospiceAssociations support for this legislation Is the Senator aware ofthat letter  This is not on my time because he is going to filibusterover there  If the Senator will yield with time being equallydivided on both sides for this colloquy  I am going to tell theSenator the deal   Will the Senator yield I can answer the Senatorsquestion But B on the other hand it is they are docs we care about our docsand we are going to have to find a way to pay for them and we will Ithink by the end of this year because we have to Docsthere cannotbe any reductionFrankly there is a partial fix in this bill anyway It is 1 yearwith an update At least this bill does take care of docs for at least1 year and with an increase That is 1 year The House wants apermanent fixFrankly I would love to have a permanent fix but we are having ahard time finding the dollars to pay for it all but this legislationdoes have a 1year fix for docsI yield to the Senator from Massachusetts  President I would very much like to respond to thatquestion First of all I appreciate the implied premise in thestatement that the Senator agrees there should be savingsThe question is Where should the savings go I mean basically theSenator is implying there should be savings and that is very good tohear I think that is a very constructive addition to a part of thisdialogue this conversation that we should take savings because thereis wasteThe Senators question is OK you take the savings what should wedo with the savings That is the basic questionThe fact is because of the reforms in Medicare a couple things arehappening No 1 we are extending the solvency of the trust fund itis another 5 years The Medicare trust fund will now be extended 5years so that helps seniorsI know the Senator didnt mean this at all but rhetoricallyearlier he said Why does this side want to throw seniors under thebus I know he didnt mean that I know he knows nobody is trying tothrow seniors under the bus nobody wants to do that in the Senate Butthe fact is these changes do extend the solvency of the trust fundThen he asked a different question and it is a very good questionIt is a judgment call what should be done with the additional savingsThis legislation takes those savings to help more people get healthinsurance One could argue those savings should not be used to helpthose without health insurance get health insurance for them Theycould go back to the Medicare trust fund they could reduce the budgetdeficitsthere are a lot of different options here But this is ahealth care reform bill In this legislation we are trying to come upwith a system if you will that gets some coherence nationwide inhealth care We dont have a system today It is a hodgepodge It is acollection It is kind of a freeforall Docs do their thingshospitals do their things nursing homes do their things each attemptto get health care based on profit motive but it is kind ofincoherent There is no realanything thereWe say lets try to look for coherence We are the onlyindustrialized country in the world that does not have some systemsome way where everybody has health insurance It seems to me we shouldtry to see if we can have some kind of system some way whereeverybody has health insurance I know it is extremely complicatedThere is no doubt it is complicated But if people have healthinsurance that opens up lot of doors for other reform one is toprevent companies health insurance companies from denying coveragebased on preexisting conditions health care status and so on and soforth because then what they lose on the margin they can make up involume because everybody has health insurance It is the same with thehospitals same with the pharmaceutical industry same with virtuallyall providers the whole system If everybody has health insurance notmost everybodymore have health insurance the better the system isThat is a judgment call But I do believe when people have healthinsurancethose who do not now have itare going to be more healthyI think that is a good thing Hospitals will not have to worry near asmuch about uncompensated care which is a big challenge to hospitalsthese days The average I think is about 1100 1200 a year perfamily when it comes to uncompensated care that private patients payThen after that we open up doors to delivery system reform You getthe system working a lot better compensating more on quality outcomesrather than quantity et cetera I know the Senator knows much aboutall these thingsBut it is a judgment call for those savings I am glad the Senatorseems to imply there should be or are savings but it is a judgmentcall as to where the savings goThe 21 percent in docs we are going to have to take that up afterthis bill It is going to be difficult because some want to pay for itsome want to not pay for it I grant you that is going to be a hugebattleYou might ask Why is that not in this bill  President this is very frustrating because we havethese blocks of time with Senators lining up to take control of thetime and to make their points and then they flee the Senate floor andwe cannot get into a debate or a colloquy We cannot make points thatrebut the points they have made because they have all left the floor  They all come in and make their points and then theyflee  Good I am glad they are staying because I want them tohear this Maybe we will all learn somethingFirst of all clearly we all care about home health care I meanlets obviously agree that we all do I see the Senator from Arizonanodding his head in agreement he does care about home health careThis Senator cares about home health care The Senator from WyomingDr Barrassohere he is over herehe cares about home health careHe has talked about home health careWe all know seniors would rather be home than in the hospital or anursing home if that is medically appropriate We all know that Iknow that personally My mother was in the hospital 2 weeks ago andshe is now thankfullypraise the Lordout of the hospital and sheis home We have a home health care person coming in every day to seemy momWhen I am there with the home health care person I am veryimpressed They do a super job It is really something to behold Mymother loves it and I love it We clearly are not going to do anythingto cut home health careBut another point I would assume all my colleagues agree with is thatwe want to cut waste if there is waste We want to cut waste out ofthe healthcare system Why should we allow waste as representatives of ourpeoplethe taxpayers We want to cut out waste Again I see theSenator from Arizona is nodding his head yes that clearly we want tocut out waste that may or may not occur in the systemNow the next questionand it is a questionis there are lots offorms of waste and one is fraudpeople just ripping taxpayers off andripping seniors off That is clear There is a lot of waste Let metake one small example in the home health provisions in the Senatebill and that is this The General Accountability Office found that inthe home health industry there are a lot of outlier expenditures whichare fraudulent that is some home health agencies classify theirexpenditures for home health as outliersas extra paymentsfor verysick peopleIn fact there is one county in Florida which accounts for 60 percentof all outlier reimbursements whereas they provide health care foronly 1 percent of the Nations people The GAO has found lots ofexamples where the outlier portion of home health is abused It isfraud It is abused Well guess what The home health care industrycame to us and said Gee we have some ideas how to stop that becausewe dont like rotten apples spoiling our barrel We want to stop thisfraud that exists with excessive outlier paymentsSo they came to us with some ideas I know it is easy to think thatsuggestions might be classified as deals or whatnot but that has nothappened They came with an idea of how to cut excessive costs inoutliers and we have done that That is in this bill There are a lotof other provisions with respect to home health careI know the Senators have letters from their home States I dont knowif they are referring to a Housepassed bill which is very aggressivein cutting home health care benefits or whether they have read themost recent language in the Senate bill which essentially is much lessaggressive because in talking to the agencies they were saying Yeswe can live with these changessuch as rebasing and market basketupdates phasing them in instead of immediatelywith the idea againof getting rid of excessive payments and fraudulent paymentsI say excessive because the home health care industry is enjoying an11percent growth rate annually as it is right now in dollars Wellsome think it is 17 percent The chart I have is 11 percent but maybe17 percent Then the national health care spending rate spending forall care goes up about 6 percent a year about 6 percent a yearnationwide Home health without reform is between 11 and 17 percent Itis almost doubleUnder this legislation spending will be about 8 percent Remembernational health spending is 6 percent and the home health industry didwrite a letter saying Yes we can live with thatMy approach frankly in regard to legislation is to work withgroups to work with industries and talk to them and not just bedraconian and not be arbitrary in cuts or changes You talk to them tosee what accommodations can be made consistent with your principlesOne of my principles is stopping a lot of the fraud and to see ifthere is a way to cut excessive spending because sometimes there isexcessive spending around here and that is what we have done in thehome health industryI could go into more detail but I want my colleagues to know thereis real solid sound reason for these changes in the home healthprovisions and it is my judgment this will not hurt home health carefor patients That is a very important point to makeThe same is basically true with the other industriessay with regardto the hospital industry We worked with them and said OK we know youshould be cut I talked to a lot of hospital administrators privatelyand said What do you thinkThey said Yeah Max we should take a haircut Our hospital shouldtake a haircutAs you well know you sometimes go to a hospital and you say Goodgosh why do they have that big fountain out front Why do they haveall that marble Why does this look like the Taj Mahal You dont needthat for health careSo then they crank that back for the need of their health care Someof the executives say to me privately Yeah there should be somereductions in hospital payments So we go to the hospitals and sayWhat is reasonable Remember this is over a 10year periodThey say We could take a 155 billion cut But they say that inpart because they know what they lose on the margin they can make upin volume because of everybodys health insurance That means toothat we can get health care reformYou know it is hard to get the health insurance industry to workwith us if there is no health insurance for most Americans If there isno health insurance for most Americans then the health insuranceindustry is inclined to revert back to their old waysor try toanywayunderwriting insurance denying policies based on preexistingconditions et ceteraSo this whole effort is to work with groupswork with consumergroups with labor with hospitals doctors the insurance industrypharmaceuticalsto see what is reasonable That is democracyto tryto get some kind of broadbased kind of rough justice agreement to putthis together That is the effort we have undertaken in thislegislationI hear criticism well gee we are cutting this and cutting thatBut lets rememberand I know my colleagues agree with thisthe wastein the American health care system is somewhere between 300 billion ayear to upper estimates of 800 billion a year It is waste and wehave to figure out a way to get rid of the waste without sacrificingcare and actually at the same time improving the quality of careThat is the major goalSo when you see reductions in some of the payments to providers alot of that is an honest attempt to get rid of the waste or excessivepayments Lets take Medicare Advantage Somebody quoted Tom Scullytoday I have a quote from Tom Scully that says there is way too muchspending in Medicare Advantage I dont have the exact quote but it isbasically a public quote that we should cut Medicare Advantage spendingbecause there is way too much expense in Medicare AdvantageIt is a question of judgment as to how much to cut I grant you Butstill there are areas where there is excessive spending there iswaste and home health care is a good area where we worked hard torefine the changes to get rid of some of the fraudthe outliers Imentionedbut in a way that helps seniors get good home health care   If the Senator will yield I thank my colleagues forstaying on the floor I appreciate that   President I think we have less than 4 minutesremaining on this side I see someone else who wishes to speak Ipromised him time and Senator Durbin as well I know they are botheloquent orators It is a bit difficult here So I will split it inhalf the time remaining between each of the two    Madam President I ask unanimous consent that we continuewith debate and debate only as under the previous order for anadditional hour with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minuteseach Madam President I yield to the Senator from MichiganMs Stabenow 5 minutes   Madam President I ask unanimous consent that SenatorRockefeller be added as cosponsor to the Lincoln amendment No 2905 Madam President may I ask how much time remains on eachside I yield 10 minutes to the Senator fromIllinois  Madam President I suggest the Senator from Iowa berecognized  Madam President I ask unanimous consent that 10 moreminutes of debate be allowed evenly divided Hearing no objection Madam President I would just like to state as clearly asI possibly can so people understand the Medicare savings are beingused for Medicare There is a strong implication by many Senators thatthe savings are not going to be used for Medicare that it will gosomeplace else That is not true The Medicare savings are going to beused for MedicareWhat are the savings I think all Senators would like to reducewaste All Senators agree there is too much waste in the currentsystem It makes good sense to try to attack that waste root out thatwaste and where there are overexpenditures to try to get the levelsdown to a reasonable level Everybody knows we have spent too manydollars on Medicare Advantage Everybody knows that That is why we arebringing that cost downThere is also waste and fraudI know my good friend from SouthDakota understands thisin home health care agencies In the State ofFlorida for example the Government Accountability Office showed thatin Florida 60 percent of the outlier paymentsthe extra money thatgoes for sicker patientswere in one county That county has 1 percentof seniors It had 60 percent of the outlier payments according to theGovernment Accountability Office That is fraud They rooted out a lotof fraud in home healthHome health is very good My mother is in home health right now Itworks really well I am very proud of the home health caretaker therewho takes care of my mother But we are reducing some of theoverpayments We are getting the waste out And guess what Thosesavings where do they go They go back into Medicare I repeat thatThey go back into Medicare I do not know if any Senator wants to openup his ears or her ears and hear that They go back into MedicareGuess what That is why the solvency of the Medicare trust fund isextendedIf these socalled cuts which we hear about on the other side werereally cuts as implied by the other side you would think that wouldhurt Medicare You would think that might reduce the period in whichthe trust fund would be solvent that it would go insolvent at anearlier time if we were really cutting Medicare No it is theopposite These are savings in Medicare which extend the life ofMedicarePlease pleaseI see my friend from Iowa I think he understandsthese Medicare savings go into Medicare for extending the solvency ofthe Medicare trust fund I see my friend from South Dakota I think heunderstandshe is sitting there and grinning at me nowI think he understands those savings go back into Medicare and extendthe solvency of the trust fund So lets make that very clearSecond we are using some of the money to reduce Part B premiumsThat helps seniors If Part B premiums are reduced that helps seniorsBy how much Madam President 30 billion over 10 years That willreduce seniors Part B premiums That helps seniors We are not takingmoney away from seniors we are helping seniors giving more dollars toseniors in this legislationIn addition there are additional benefits for seniors in thislegislation We are starting to close the doughnut holethat issomething seniors talk aboutin prescription drug benefits They wantthat doughnut hole closedI might add to that there are other benefits new preventivebenefits under Medicare for mammograms preventive screeningscolonoscopies annual wellness visitsall new benefitsSo I want to make it very clear that it is not true when someSenators say we are taking money away from Medicare and creating awhole new entitlement program We are not taking money away fromMedicare and hurting seniors We are reforming how dollars are paidtaking the waste out and extra excessive payments and putting themoney back into Medicare back for seniors back for beneficiariesAlso not one penny of guaranteed benefits will be cut Not one pennycan be cut So please people understand that the savings go to helpseniors with more benefits extending the solvency of the trust fundThat is what we are doing If we keep that firm point in mind thenmaybe we can go address some of the next steps that are in this billBut that is very importantMadam President I do not know how much time I have Isee the Senator from Minnesota anxiously sitting over there in thecorner Maybe we could give him a couple    Madam President if my good friend would allow me tointerrupt to propound a unanimous consent agreement so Senators knowwhen votes are going to come up and then continue  Madam President I ask unanimous consent that once thisagreement is entered it be in order for Senator Kerry or his designeeto be recognized to offer the majority sidebyside to the Johannsmotion that the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Kerryamendment and that upon disposition of the Kerry amendment the Senatethen proceed to vote in relation to the

today Theres been a lot ofreports in the press about the majoritys meeting on a second stimulusbill and Id like to ask the gentleman Mr Speaker if he couldclarify the timing the content and the cost of a proposed secondstimulus bill And I yield Mr Speaker I would ask the gentleman I note that he did announcethat we will be considering HR 4173 the financial regulation billand perhaps seven appropriations bills I dont know which form thatwould be in whether it would be separately or in an omnibus form butnonetheless all of these are incredibly large measures costingbillions of dollars of taxpayer money stretching over thousands ofpagesMy question Mr Speaker is What is the gentlemans intention as tothe period of time which Members and the public will have to reviewthese bills prior to the Members voting on them And does that meanthat we will still be consistent with the gentlemans representationson other bills prior to this session that we would have 72 hours forconsideration and review of those bills as well as any managersamendment and selfexecuting amendments in a ruleAnd I yield Mr Speaker since this is our first colloquy following Thanksgivingbreak I would like to ask the gentleman if he could give the Members asense of what legislation perhaps that we will be voting on for theremainder of this month And I yield  And I know Im joinedby the gentlelady from Florida in thanking you very much for your workon the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act and bringing that to thefloor  I yield to the gentleman from Maryland the majorityleader for the purpose of announcing next weeks schedule   And I do realize that the Househas considered its version although we all know that when they comeback from conference especially many of the Members on both sides ofthe aisle have some concerns about earmarks and others which would Ithink warrant the time to review these bills In the same light MrSpeaker it is the concern of many that we have an opportunity to lookat any managers amendment or selfexecuting amendments in the rulesthat are presented to the body and our having time to review that aswell And I would just make that noteMr Speaker I would ask the gentleman does he expect a final healthcare bill this month And I yield  And as a followup to thatMr Speaker I know theres been some discussion or reports that theSenate may be scheduled to be in session past the Christmas holidayand I was wondering Mr Speaker if the gentleman expected that toimpact the Houses schedule after Christmas And I yield   Speaker I certainly appreciate that extension of anoffer to allow us to once again proffer our ideas As the gentlemanmay know I did speak out yesterday with a list of what I call a nocost jobs plan and I am happy to forward that to the gentleman I havemade a similar type of request of the White House and I think havegotten a response that they too may be willing to consider some of theRepublican solutions to the current crisis that people are feelingacross this countryMr Speaker I would say that I am somewhat heartened to hear thegentleman talk about the ineffectiveness of the first stimulus billThe gentleman did say that the term stimulus was a little broaderthan what theyre looking at now And in my opinion I thought that thedefinition of a stimulus bill was to create jobs So if the gentlemannow is agreeing with me that the creation of jobs did not hit the markthe way that was promised on the first stimulus bill that we do needto finally focus on job creation that gives me a lot of confidenceMr Speaker because at least were now talking about the same thingAnd along those lines again I am thankful that the gentleman askedfor our solutions and were going to proffer thoseBut I do want to suggest that we can and there are some commonsensethings we can sit down and probably agree on that we could do right nowthat wouldnt cost the taxpayers anything and we wouldnt have to becontinuing to mortgage the future of our children I think both of uscan agree Mr Speaker that both sides have done their share to digthe hole of incurring too much debt for this country Enough is enoughAnd I do think that we have and will offer solutions that will begin toarrest that trend and at the same time focus on job creation  And I would like to ask one more point and thenI will yield If we are talking about finally shifting to the mode MrSpeaker of job creation Id like to ask the gentleman has there beenany discussion in his caucus about perhaps holding back on some of themeasures that are being discussed such as the financial regulatoryreform bill coming to the floor next week because there is a studyrecently released by the University of Chicago University CollegeLondon and George Mason University economists which said that thispackage of reform bills coming out of the Financial Services Committeewill reduce consumer borrowing by at least 21 percent and reduce newjobs by 43 percent And essentially the study comes to the conclusionthat interest rates will rise by 141 basis points which will yield theloss of over a million jobs over the next 5 years So if we areconcerned about job creation why are we moving forward with such ameasure And I yield And I would say he would agree with me that since the beginning ofthe 111th priority one for this Nation has been job creation  The stimulus bill wasbrought to this floor with the promise that it would stop unemploymentfrom exceeding 8 percent We are now at over 10 percent nationalunemployment The facts are the factsUnder this administration the deficit has tripled since the lastadministration left That is the facts The gentleman points out CBOsays that weve created X number of jobs I would say to the gentlemanwhile you have people across this country102 percent of theworkforce being out of workthere is no way that anyone in thiscountry would believe CBO when it says the economy is better Thatsthe factAnd so if were going to be about job creation my simple point isthis about bringing the package of financial regulatory reform bills tothe floor I dont doubt the gentlemans intention to try and do theright thing But the reality is this is a case where were doing thewrong thing for the right reason This bill impacts negatively the jobcreators We know this bill will increase interest rates 141 basispoints which means the loss of an additional millionplus jobs overthe next 5 yearsSo in that vein I would ask the gentleman again if we are to seeour way to work together lets relieve the harm This bill adds to theharm In the same way I would ask the gentleman there is continuedtalk of the bill otherwise known as Card Check If Ive heard it onceI think all Members have from small businesses and large the jobcreators Please please dont pass that bill because that will createa huge drain on job creationSo I would ask the gentleman is there any sense in his caucus thatmaybe now in times of high unemployment is not the time to bring upCard Check  Speaker if the gentleman would like to come to mydistrict and talk to the businesses there I think I could gather upmany individuals who have put their entire lifes investment savings onthe line and dont want to see Washington or this Congress continue tothreaten the very existence of those businessesI yield My purpose in bringing up this notion that we still have this CardCheck bill out there is to demonstrate the fact that there really is adisconnect as far as doing what we say and follow what I do Because ifwere serious about relieving the pain on job creators if wereserious about getting Americans back to work we wouldnt benecessarily bringing the wrong bills to the floor for the right reasonwhich is my point Mr SpeakerNo one is quibbling with intention here I think that I would agreewith the gentleman that there is a sense in America that there is not alevel playing field at giving people a fair shot at their returns onWall Street or a fairshot in terms of heavy regulations in hand coming from WashingtonSo we can all agree that we need to make the environment better forjob creators and people who want to jump in and take risks But thefinancial regulatory reform package that is being brought to the floorjust as the Card Check bill thats still being spoken of around herethose are job killers We ought to at least relieve the harm so thatpeople were relying on to create jobs can get back to work to do thatThat was simply my point Mr SpeakerIn closing Mr Speaker I would just note for the gentleman that 28million Americans have lost their jobs since the passage of themajoritys first stimulus bill and the Nations debt now stands atover 12 trillionI thank the gentleman for his time and I yield back
H_OK_LUCAS,2009-12-09, Chairman I yield 212 minutes to the gentleman fromKansas Mr Moran  Chairman I yield 212 minutes to the gentleman fromIowa Mr King Mr Chairman I must rise today in opposition to HR 4173Regulatory reform of our financial system is indeed needed Howeverrather than using this opportunity to enact meaningful reform thatcreates financial stability and encourages economic growth themajority has constructed a massive piece of legislation that willrestrict credit availability and does little to address the realproblems in the financial industryIn addition to dramatically expanding the power of the FederalReserve and establishing what is in effect a credit czar who willhave virtually unlimited authority to restrict consumer choices thisbill will create a permanent bailout some would call slush fund forsocalled too big to fail companies funded by a 150 billion tax onfinancial institutions This tax will reduce available capital forlending and will most certainly be passed on to consumers in the formof higher feesAs the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee I also rise inopposition to title III the OTC derivatives title that is currentlyin HR 4173 This is the same title that was adopted by the FinancialServices Committee I opposed this title in the committee where Imalso a member because it makes it too costly for endusers to managerisk and unnecessarily ties up capital that could otherwise be used tocreate jobs and grow their businessesHowever Chairman Peterson and Chairman Frank will bring an amendmentto the floor that will strike and replace this derivatives title ThisPetersonFrank amendment is the product of negotiations between our twocommittees I prefer I must admit the version reported by theAgriculture Committee but this compromise is significantly better thanthe current title in the bill and I will support its inclusion But Isupport its inclusion only if the other secondary amendments that maybe offered by my friends on the other side of the aisle are defeatedsave oneI would be remiss if I didnt thank Chairman Peterson for workingwith Agriculture Committee Republicans in a process that started backin February when our committee reported out HR 977 Chairman Petersonworked in good faith to address issues our members brought to thetable and we learned together the concerns of all of the participantsin the overthecounter derivatives markets Although we were able toaddress some of these concerns many still remain unresolvedWe were able to improve areas most important to endusers themanufacturers the energy companies and food processors that use swapagreements to manage price risk so they can provide consumers with thelowestcost products Endusers should not be regulated as though theywere major financial houses residing on Wall Street They did not causethe financial collapse They should not be regulated like they didI would have preferred language that would have made clear that onlythose entities that can have a significant adverse impact on the USfinancial system be regulated as major swap participants Similarly Idont understand why market makers that only deal in cleared productsneed to have additional capital and margin requirements imposed uponthem by the Federal GovernmentFinally we should not forget that new opportunities innovativeproducts and services and ultimately economic growth are born frompeople willing and able to take risk and invest We should not attemptto regulate risk out of existence As it stands now the PetersonFrankamendment allows the appropriate financial regulator to closely monitormarket trends and market participants who may generate too much riskfor a healthy and robust financial system This amendment also givesthe regulator the appropriate tools to reduce risk before it cannegatively affect our economy The PetersonFrank amendment isntperfect but it is a marked improvement over other legislative effortseither proposed or considered   Chairman I yield 312 minutes to the distinguishedgentleman from Indiana Mr Burton  Can I inquire of the Chair how much time I have remainingpleaseThe Acting CHAIR Ms Titus The gentleman has 312 minutesremaining Madam Chairman I yield myself as much time as I mightconsumeIn my concluding remarks Id like to observe to my colleagues youcan pass a 1200page bill you can set up the process to generate tensof thousands of pages of rules and regulations you can hire an army offaceless bureaucrats to enforce all of that stuff to make decisionsfor the economy to make decisions for business to make decisions forpeople but you cant repeal the laws of supply and demandIf you add enough fees and enough rules and regulations to theprocess of delivering credit you will drive away the sources ofcredit reduce the supply of credit At the same time we hope toreinvigorate this economy to start it growing again Demand for creditwill go up What happens when you lower the supply of credit and youraise the demand for credit Through pieces of legislation like thisultimately you drive up the cost of credit for everyone The laws ofsupply and demandI know my friends believe theyre sincerely doing the right thingbut the right thing in this scenario will drive down the availabilityof credit while at the same time demand goes up and costs will go uptoo and that will affect every business every person every entitythat needs creditI come from a capitalstarved district in Oklahoma Creditsimportant to every farmer rancher businessperson every personengaged in the industry of energy production every individual with afamily trying to send their kids to school Lets not make everythingthey do cost moreI would now yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from theFinancial Services Committee Mr Bachus of Alabama
S_WY_BARRASSO,2009-12-03,  President I come to the floor also to talk aboutMedicare and what I see to be significant cuts in the Medicare ProgramI practiced medicine in Wyoming for 25 years taking care of familiesfrom across the State and many of these wonderful folks who are onMedicare They depend on Medicare for their health care They depend onMedicare Patients depend on it the hospitals depend upon it thephysicians the nursing homes the home health care agenciesall ofthem depend on Medicare for their health careI listened to my close friends from across the aisle come to thefloor as well and they seem to be trying to convince the Americanpublic that the 2074page bill which weighs over 20 pounds actuallydoes not cut Medicare I heard the chairman of the Finance Committeetalk about it on the floor I have heard it from the majority leaderThe health care reform plan we are looking at on this floor cuts 464billion from Medicare and I have a list of all the Medicare cuts inthis bill page after page column after column When you add them allup it cuts 135 billion from our hospitalsfrom our hospitalsthatare providing the care We have heard about some of the cost shiftingfrom the Senator from Rhode Island Cost shifting occurs Medicare isone of the biggest deadbeats when it comes to paying for hospitalservices and it is why hospitals end up shifting more costs to peoplewho have health insurance and why for those people their premiumswill go up if this bill becomes law So 135 billion cut fromhospitalsThe bill cuts 120 billion from a program called Medicare AdvantageThere are 11 million Americans in this country who are on MedicareAdvantage They know who they are They know it is a program that hasworked well for them People ask me what the difference is Why wouldsomebody want to be on a program called Medicare Advantage Well thereis an advantage to those seniors who depend upon Medicare for theirhealth care if they are on Medicare Advantage The No 1 advantage isit actually helps coordinate careWe know one of the best ways to help people keep down the cost oftheir medical care is to find problems early and to get earlytreatment So find the problem and treat it before it gets too badWell Medicare Advantage does both preventive care as well ascoordinated care One of the big problems with Medicare is it will paya lot for doing something to someone but it will not pay much forhelping someone stay healthy But now all of a sudden we are going tocut 120 billion from Medicare Advantage which actually works onprevention and on coordinated careThen there is 42 billion from home health care agencies that will becut Those are the folks who come into someones home and help themstay out of the hospital The advantage of home health care is to allowpeople to get care at home and not need to be in the hospital butsuddenly we are looking at 42 billion in cuts on Medicare for homehealth care agenciesThen lets take a look at nursing homes 15 billion in cuts fornursing homesthose facilities taking care of people on Medicarewhich to me means they are actually cutting it from the people whodepend on Medicare for their nursing home needsAs an orthopedic surgeon I have taken care of many people such as agrandmother who breaks her hip She doesnt need to go into a nursinghome permanently but what she needs to do is to go there for a shortperiod of time for rehabilitation where she can get better and getstronger She is not ready to go home and she does not need to stay ina hospital but she needs to be in a nursing home for a period of timeto get rehabilitated and then to get ready to go home and go back to anindependent life There is a gap in time and nursing homes help withthat They are wonderful as a way to give somebody an opportunity togain their strength In our country such as it is now so manygrandparents are living in communities where perhaps their childrenor grandchildren are no longer living or they cant go and live with ason or daughter but they need additional help and so they go to anursing homeSo for that patient who has broken a hipthe type of patient I havetaken care of in the hospitalthis bill is going to end up cuttingfrom the hospital 135 billion from Medicare for that patient It willend up cutting nursing homes by 15 billion for patients who rely onnursing homes as they recover from their hip surgery Then once theyget home and get ready for an independent life a lot of times they canbenefit from home health caresomeone coming into the home andchecking on them giving them medications making sure they are doingall right checking their wound and a number of different thingsthisbill will cut 42 billion from home health care agencies againcutting the services to people who depend upon those services for theirhealth care needsThen there is an 8 billion cut from hospice providers people whotake care of our patientsmy patientsin the final stages of theirlife At a time in their life when their body may be riddled withcancer or they just need a place to go and be treated with respect andto be cared for we are cutting 8 billion in this bill from thehospice providerspeople who are there and helping people in the finalstages of their lifeWhen I look at this I say How in the world can my colleagues on theother side say they are not cutting Medicare for our seniors I readthrough the bill and there is 135 billion from hospitals 120 billionfrom Medicare Advantage 40 billion from home health care agenciesalmost 15 billion from nursing homes and 8 billion from hospiceproviders for a total of 464 billion for this countrys seniors Idont think we should pass this bill Of course there is another 500billion in taxes It is a huge and hugely expensive billTo me this is absolutely nothing but robbing our folks who are onMedicare to start a whole new government program I am worried seniorsall around the country are going to have less access to doctorsespecially in rural and in frontier States such as Wyoming I amconcerned they are going to see community hospitals and home healthcare agencies and nursing homesskilled nursing facilitiesstrugglingto keep their doors openIt is time for this Congress for this Senate to listen to Americasseniors Lets listen to the administrations own chief actuaryRichard Foster the chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare andMedicaid Services said if these Medicare cuts take effect then manyproviders could find it difficult to remain profitable and might endtheir participation in the program They may say I dont wantanything else to do with Medicare I am closing my doors to MedicarepatientsWe cannot have that in this country but I believe that is what thisbill does Even the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said theseMedicare cuts could reduce access to care or diminish the quality ofcare Is that what this Senate wants to reduce access to care ordiminish the quality of careHow many experts does it take to convince the majority party thatcutting Medicare to pay for a brandnew government program isirresponsible We all agree Medicare is going broke The trust fundwill run out of money in the year 2017 It has more than 37 trillionin unfunded liabilities The Presiding Officer knows that in his Stateas well as in mine Medicares physician payment formula which callsfor doctors to face a more than 40percent cut over the next 10 yearsis a system that is broken The Reid bill does nothing to fix thisproblem Instead it takes 12 trillion from Medicare to create abrandnew entitlement program It punishes a group of people in order tobenefit another To me that is not reform It will only make thesystem worseThat is why I support the motion we will be voting on today theMCCain motion It says we are not going to finance a new governmentprogram on the backs of our Medicare patients on the people who dependupon Medicare for their health care It instructs the Finance Committeeto write a bill that doesnt cut hospitals that doesnt cut homehealth care that doesnt cut Medicare Advantage and that doesnt cuthospice for our seniors who depend upon those services A vote for theMCCain motion gives us a chance to get this rightI do want health care reform I just dont want this bill This isthe wrong prescription for our country I dont believe we have to takethe money out of Medicare and then spend it on a brandnew entitlementprogram I go home to Wyoming every weekendand I know other Membersgo home and listen to their constituentsand what I hear from thepeople in Wyoming is Dont cut my Medicare Dont raise my taxesDont make things worse for me in this economy I certainly cantafford it The people of Wyoming want practical commonsense healthcare reform reform that drives down the cost of medical care improvesaccess to providers and creates more choicesIt is clear this bill has a very different plan in mind It is nottoo late to work together for meaningful reform We do not have todismantle the current health care system and build it up in the imageof big government and then try to say this is reform The Americanpeople are telling us what kind of changes they want and that is why Iwill be voting for the MCCain motionI yield the floor  I dont have that letter with me but everything I lookat says this will gut Medicare make it go broke sooner and it will bebad for seniors  President my wife Bobbi was diagnosed with breastcancer by a screening mammogram in her forties It is that screeningmammogram that has saved her life By the time of the mammogram thetumor had spread and she has had two operations and two full bouts ofchemotherapy I do not want a government bureaucrat making a decisionfor the women of America if they should be allowed to have screeningmammograms It saves lives1 in 1900 for women in their 40sThe Reid bill empowers bureaucrats to decide what preventive benefitswill be allowed for American women The amendment from the Senator fromMaryland does the samebureaucrats not the physicians who are doingthe treating That is why I support the amendment of the Senator fromAlaska because that amendment says the Federal Government cannot userecommendations of the US Preventive Services Task Forcerecommendations from bureaucrats to deny care to anyone includingseniors on Medicareanyone in America That is how this decisionshould be made not by government bureaucratsI yield the floor  The Senator absolutely believes we need to find a wayto make sure all the citizens of this country have insurance and thereare ways to do it allowing people to buy insurance across State linesThat doesnt take a 2000page bill There are ways to do it to helpget down the cost of care that give individuals incentives to buy theirown insurance giving tax breaks to those individuals We could dothings with tort reform such as the loser pays rule We could allowsmall groups to join together to have a better ability to bargain andget the cost of insurance downSo this Senator absolutely believes we need to find a way to geteveryone insured There are people who need help who dont have helpand we need to find a way to do that but it is not this 2000pagebill  Thereimbursement system focuses more on doing things than on helpingpatients stay healthy and get better Medicare has done a terrible jobof that over the years in terms of giving incentives for people oreven for paying for preventive services They have not done that overthe yearsThis is an illustration of how the system is broken It is nowDecemberthe end of the yearand it is the busiest time of year forme as a physician in Wyoming because people have met theirdeductiblesthose who have insurance have met their deductibles forthe yearand they come into the office and say Is it now time for myoperation I have to get it done before the 1st of the year because mydeductible has been used up and I want to have my operation so I amnot going to have to pay for itIn this country we have the incentives all wrong in terms of healthcare We do need health care reform  I dont think this bill is the way to do it which is agovernment takeover of the health care system
S_CO_BENNET,2009-12-03,I would like to call it up at this time President I ask unanimous consent that reading ofthe amendment be dispensed with President I was paying very close attention to thefloor debate over the last few days and at times I am beginning towonder what bill it is we are debating Only in Washington could aneffort to extend the life of the Medicare trust fund be viewed ordistorted somehow as being unfair or bad for seniorsWe knowand it is in print in the CBO reportthis bill doesnt takeaway any seniors guaranteed Medicare benefits We know the billextends Medicare solvency for 5 additional years How does it do thatIt does it in a way that is different from the way government usuallydoes business which is either adding or cutting from a program Itchanges the way we deliver medicine in this country and it does it ina way that protects senior benefits and it extends the life ofMedicareThe attacks on this bill and my amendment have nothing to do withthose facts The sad part is that there are ideas on every side of thisdebate that are worth considering We should be debating those ideasrather than claiming something that is just not true about the billThese Washington tactics of trying to shift health care reform backto some committee to languish is exactly why nothing ever gets donearound here The almost unbelievable part of this is that the opponentsof my amendment say the health care bill hurts seniors Yet the billand our amendment is being supported by the AARP the Alliance forRetired Americans Center for Medicare Rights and the NationalCommittee to Preserve Social Security and MedicareWhat are the opponents of my amendment actually sayingthat AARP andother senior advocates dont know what they are doing They know whatthey are doing and they also know what is in the bill The AARP hasseniors best interests in mind and they want what is best forMedicare in the long run This bill makes tremendous strides to a moresolvent more stable Medicare Program for years to comeUnfortunately in the hopes of eventually trying to kill the billthere are people who are making claims that are frightening ourseniorsmeant to frighten themhere and also in Colorado wherepeople have been calling on their phones convinced that somehow I wantto cut their benefits Nothing could be further from the truth Ibelieve strongly in the sacred trust we have created with our seniorsThat is why I introduced this amendment Seniors are looking for simpleclarity and health care reform can help their livesThis amendment says in the clearest and most unambiguous of termsas directly as we can say it that nothing in this bill will cutguaranteed Medicare benefits All guaranteed Medicare benefits stayintact for every senior in Colorado and all across the country Seniorswill still have access to hospital stays to doctors home health carenursing homes and prescription drugsThe second part of the amendment goes further and says clearly anddirectly to seniors that we will use this bill to further protect andstrengthen Medicare We will extend the life of the Medicare trustfund We will lower premiums or cost share increase Medicare benefitsand improve access to providers You dont need to believe me Look atthe CBO These improvements will be paid for with money saved inMedicare under this billWhat is so regrettable about the debate and so tragic is if wedont actually get this done Medicare would be bankrupt in just 7yearsin 2017 In the Senate bill we are now considering we extendthe trust funds solvency by 5 years We lower premiums for seniors by30 billion over 10 years That is real money back in the pockets ofour seniors We eliminate copays that seniors now have to pay forpreventive care That means when seniors go to the doctor for acolonoscopy they would not have to make the copay like they have tounder current law When they go to get a mammogram the same is trueWe know preventive care like that saves lives and also moneyMost seniors live on a fixed income Free preventive care is the bestway to encourage seniors to seek important medical precautions Morepreventive care is proven to save lives and lower health care costsMr President health care reform will cut the cost of brandnameprescription drugs in half for those who are stuck in the gap ofcoverage between initial and catastrophic coverage We eliminate the20percent cut physicians would otherwise see next year making sureseniors can continue to see their own doctorOpponents of health care reform dont have a plan to protect seniorsand strengthen the Medicare Program I have heard more criticism aboutthe number of pages in the bill than I have heard about a responsiblealternative that would extend the life of Medicare and make the otherbenefits that are in this billI wanted to come to the floor with a simple and straightforwardmessage to seniors We will protect Medicare This bill does We willmake sure nobody touches your guaranteed benefits This bill does Wewill make sure Medicare is around for future generations This billgets us started in that direction That is why I have introduced thisamendment and why I support health care reformEverything I have said today is entirely consistent with the findingsof the CBO the nonpartisan organization that advises this ChamberThis legislation makes explicit the commitment that all of us share tothe seniors across the United States of America It is my hope thatonce this amendment passes we can get beyond the debate we have hadover the last 72 hours and get on to the substantive aspects of thebillI urge support for my amendment I yield the floor  President I wish to sum up the debate over Medicarein the Senate health bill and on the motion and amendment before usOnly in Washington DC could an effort to extend the life ofMedicare somehow be distorted as being bad for seniors We know fromthe Congressional Budget Office a nonpartisan organization thatsupports both sides of the aisle that this Senate bill does not takeaway any seniors guaranteed Medicare benefits It extends Medicaresolvency for 5 additional years My amendment simply confirms these twofactsI am the first person who would insist we have an open process forthis debate I think there are ideas on each side of this debate onthis bill that are worth considering and should be considered But itis why I find it so confounding that opponents of my amendment want tosend the entire bill back to committee so debate stops How can wereturn home to the people of our States and admit to them we just gaveup and sent health care back to the committee for another roundThe people who do not want change are the people who are content toleave it the same and do not have a theory about how to extendMedicare They would have seniors believe the bill is bad for seniorsYet AARP the Alliance for Retired Americans the Centerfor Medicare Rights and the National Committee to Preserve SocialSecurity and Medicare beg to differ They disagree They agree withthis amendment and with the underlying bill Senior advocacyorganizations grassroots organizations with their ears to the groundhearing the voices and concerns of seniors support health care reformand they agree that with my amendment this bill strengthens Medicareand preserves seniors benefitsWith the Senate bill finally reaching the floor seniors are lookingfor simple clarity on how health care reform can help their livesNothing in this bill will cut guaranteed Medicare benefits and thisbill will extend Medicare solvency for 5 additional years It actuallymakes the system work better instead of cutting or adding to a programIt actually changes the way Medicare works so it will be stronger andmore stablePeople may disagree with the prescription but as a general mattereverybody knows the status quo is unsustainable and this bill helpsseniors It eliminates the copay seniors have to pay for preventivecare We know preventive care saves lives and it saves moneyAs we close debate on my amendment and the alternative motion tocommit the bill to committee I urge all the Members of this body toconsider the consequences of inaction My amendment affirms what thecurrent Senate bill does to help seniors and strengthen Medicare Weall know even more can be done so lets continue this debate andreject the motion to commit the bill back to the Senate committeeI urge every Member of this body to support my amendment Please voteyes on the Bennet amendment and protect our seniorsI yield the floor
S_OH_VOINOVICH,2009-12-03, President over the past several months I havecome to the floor on a couple of occasions to remind my colleagues andthe American people about the unsustainable fiscal crisis confrontingthis countryOur national debt has exceeded 12 trillion for the first time inhistory In fact from 2008 to 2009 alone the Federal debt willincrease 22 percent boosting the countrys debttoincome ratioornational debt as a percentage of GDPfrom 70 percent last year to 86percent this year We have not seen this kind of debt to GDP ratiosince the Second World War 65 years agoThe American people know that this is unsustainable but my Senatecolleagues from on the other side of the aisle continue to ignore thisreality I pledged that I would continue to cry the emperor has noclothes until we did something to address this crisisI should explain Most people know the story The Emperors NewClothes by Hans Christian AndersonIn the tale an emperor goes about the land wearing a nonexistentsuit sold to him by a new tailor who convinced the monarch the suit ismade of the finest silks The tailorstwo swindlerstell the emperorthat the threads of his robes will be so fine that they will lookinvisible to those dimwitted or unfit for their position The emperorand his ministers themselves unable to see the clothing lavish thetailor with praise for the suit because they do not want to appeardimwitted or incompetentWord spread across the kingdom of the emperors beautiful new robesTo show off the extraordinary suit a parade was formed People linedthe streets to see the emperor show off his new clothes In this casethe health care reform bill before the SenateAgain afraid to appear stupid or unfit everyone pretends to see thesuit It is only when a child cries out the emperor wears noclothes does the crowd acknowledge that the emperor is in factnakedLike the little boy crying out those of us on this side of the aisleare pointing out this bill is fiscally not responsibleYet while not addressing our current health care challenges the socalled health care reform bill we are debating also creates newprograms at a time when we arent paying for the one we already haveand it adds 25 trillion to what we are already spendingI learned as a mayor and as a Governor if you cannot afford what youare doing how can you take on new responsibilitiesWe could be using this opportunity to fix our health care system byfinally working to lower health care costs and pass those savings on tocitizens who are already overburdened by an expensive health caresystemYet instead of commonsense incremental reforms that increase accessto affordable quality health care reduce the costs of health care forall Americans and lower our national health care spending we havethis bill before usUnfortunately the bill violates the medical principle first do noharm Instead it is more of the samemore spending and more taxesonan already struggling economy this at a time when we are currentlywitnessing the worst recession this country has experienced since theGreat DepressionThe legislation we are considering when fully implemented as Ipointed out spends 25 trillion to restructure our health caresystem Yet it fails to rein in the cost of health spending in the nextdecade According to the Congressional Budget Office the FederalGovernments commitment to health care that is the cost of healthcare paid for by the Federal Government would actually increase Inother words we are adding more on to this extraordinary debt we haveunfunded mandates we havein terms of MedicareThe bills proponents will tell you it is paid for But as DavidBroder points out in his November 22 Washington Post editorialWhile CBO said that both the Housepassed bill and the oneReid has drafted meet Obamas test by being budget neutralevery expert I have talked to says the public has it rightThese bills as they stand are budgetbustersAnd that is what many people are hearing right now from theirconstituents particularly many of those individuals who are takingadvantage of the Medicare Advantage ProgramFurthermore as former CBO Director Douglas HoltzEakin pointed outin the Wall Street Journal this bill uses every budget gimmick andtrick in the booksWhat are these gimmicks Most troubling to me and what my colleagueson the floor have been discussing for the last few days is what thebill does to the Medicare ProgramI think we need to be honest with the American people The MedicareProgram is already on shaky footing Despite 37 trillion in unfundedunfundedfuture Medicare costs and the prediction that the Medicaretrust fund is expected to be insolvent by 2017 this bill calls for465 billion in cuts to Medicare not to fix the program but as Isaid to create new programsFor example this health care bill fails to acknowledge the 250billion that is necessary to reform the Medicare physician paymentformula to ensure that our Nations seniors will be able to see thedoctor of their choice in the future I have heard it firsthand fromfamily and friends that in some places in Ohio Medicare beneficiariesalready face delays for physician servicesRight in my hometown I have had doctors tell me George if I havesomebody before they are Medicare eligible and they go on Medicare Iwill take care of them I am not taking anymore new Medicare patientsbecause of the reimbursement system I heard the same thing in terms ofMedicaidWe have a problem out there Sadly my friends on the other side ofthe aisle do not want to be honest with the American people and includethe cost of the physician payment fix in the bill It should be thereLets be honest about it Lets be transparent It is another exampleI think of the smoke and mirrors and budget gimmicks and tricks thatformer CBO Director Douglas HoltzEakin mentionedLike I said we must fix our health care system to help millions ofAmericans who find themselves without insurance and those struggling topay their health insurance premiums We must increase competition inthe private market make it easier for small businesses and individualsto purchase insurance and reform our medical liability system I callthis malpractice lawsuit abuse reform We should have done that a longtime ago But the fact is that the trial lawyers do not want that tohappen So we are doing nothing about a problem that is causingphysicians to give unnecessary tests that are driving up the cost ofhealth care in this countryMost important we need to focus our efforts on jobs jobs jobsjobs jobs because one of the best things we can do to increase healthcare coverage is to help businesses start to hire again I need a jobOne of the reasons I need a job is when I have a job in mostinstances I have some form of health care We have a lot of people whoare being dropped off We need more jobs We should be concentrating onthat if we want to up the number of people who can get health careTo repeat we do not need to create another set of governmentprograms that spends an additional 25 trillion to build a newentitlement system when we cannot afford the one we have now That isthe biggest thing with me If you cannot afford what you have how canyou take on more When we do that we are being fiscally irresponsibleWe should deal with what we have It is amazing to me If you lookaround the country States are cutting their expenses and they areraising taxes And what are we doing in Washington We are taking onmore expensive programs we cannot afford That is what I think istroublesome to me as a debt hawkWe need to understand what we are doing The American people arepaying attention and they know that the emperor has no clothes when itcomes to doing something about our unsustainable fiscal crisisWe are losing our credibility and our credit worldwide They know itis immoral to be putting this debt on the backs of our children andgrandchildren I believe this health care bill does that exactly Itexacerbates our current fiscal situationThere are lots of good things out there a lot of good things we allwould like to do But just like a family if you cannot afford what youare doing now how can you afford to take on more responsibility interms of debtMr President I yield the floor  President I rise today to join my good friend andChairman on the Oversight of Government Management SubcommitteeSenator Akaka to ensure that security clearance reform efforts begunin recent years continue by cosponsoring the Security ClearanceModernization and Reporting Act of 2009Since the 1990s the Governments Accountability Office GAO hasdocumented problems with the Department of Defenses DoD personnelsecurity clearance program and in 2005 added the program to its highrisk list DoDs personnel security clearance program has remained onthe 2007 and 2009 high risk listsIn an effort to address this matter and improve the securityclearance process Congress set benchmarks for the time taken to issueclearances in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of2004 IRTPA IRTPA also required the President to select a singleagency or office to oversee the security clearance process across thefederal government and required uniform policies regarding the securityclearance process reciprocal recognition of security clearances amongagencies an evaluation of technology to expedite security clearanceprocesses and a plan to reduce the length of the security clearanceprocess While progress has been made to decrease the amount of time ittakes to obtain a security clearance more improvement is needed tofully reform the security clearance process but reform efforts havebeen delayed this year by an interagency review of the securityclearance reform initiatives undertaken over the past several yearsTo ensure that the good work begun with passage of IRTPA in 2004 Iam pleased to cosponsor Senator Akakas legislation that extendsIRTPAs reporting requirements relating to security clearance reformefforts beyond their current 2011 expiration date and requires moredetails in those reports about the amount of time required byindividual agencies to conduct both security clearance investigationsand adjudications To ensure that efforts begun over the past severalyears continue the bill codifies portions of Executive Order 13467which deals with reforming processes related to eligibility for accessto classified information The bill also calls for the development ofthe strategic plan GAO has been asking for since the DoD personnelsecurity clearance program was put on its high risk list in 2005 andrequires a more detailed information technology strategy relating tosecurity clearance reform effortsI am proud to cosponsor this bill and thank the Senator from Hawaiifor his work on this legislation to address such an important issueBy Mr KERRY for himself Mr Cardin Mr Kaufman MrsGillibrand and Mr MenendezS 2835 A bill to reduce global warming pollution

S_RI_REED,2009-12-03, President I think it is important to focus on thefiscal difficulties we have today but I think it is also important torecognize the probable causes of these huge deficits two warsunfunded no attempt to fund them spent simply by running up thedeficit tax cuts which were unfunded and which did not ultimatelygenerate the kind of sustained economic growth and job growth thattheir supporters advertised and then the Medicare Part D program anentitlement program which was also completely unpaid forToday we have people talking about entitlement reform how that is akey aspect of health reform But so many of my colleagues on theRepublican side supported President Bush when heproposed the Medicare Part D program a worthy program in concept butin the context of not paying for it it is a concept that is costing usgreatly todayAdditionally it is particularly ironic at this moment because weare considering a MCCain motion that would report this health care billback to the committee with the instructions to restore 400 billion inspending roughly over 10 years I cannot think of anything morecontrary to the notion of entitlement reformWhat we have tried to do in this bill is to restructure Medicare sothat it will continue providing quality health care but also recognizethe high costs we are facing going forward and the general economicclimate we face today Again let me remind you in January 2001 theunemployment rate was about 46 percent When President Obama tookoffice it was double that and growing and continuing to growWe have seen some effects to limit this growth but it is still acritical issue Again this reform package is designed not only to dealwith the quality of health care accessibility to health care andaffordability of health care but it is designed to over the longterm begin to rein in costs that are absolutely out of controlThose suffering the most from this course are the American peopleand in some respects small business men and women Their health carecosts are going up faster than any other costs and in many instancesfaster than wages and it is unsustainableIf in my State of Rhode Island we do not take effective action wewill see within several years premiums reaching 24000 to 30000 ayear for a family of four We cannot sustain thatIf someone is interested in taking the very difficult step ofentitlement reform they would reject the MCCain motion But there areother reasons to reject the amendment as well First the funding thathas been eliminated from the current health care system and the systemgoing forward has been eliminated because it does not improve careThis is particularly true in Medicare AdvantageThis was a program that was developed and sold essentially to theAmerican people as cost containment for Medicare This was one of theproposals that would rein in outofcontrol health care costs by givinginsurance companies the ability to manage more effectivelyOf course what we have seen is a significant increase in payments toMedicare Advantage payments over traditional Medicare Of course theseinsurance companies can manage health care very well as long as theyare receiving very significant premium payments from beneficiariesBut those premiums do not essentially go to better health care Itcertainly goes however to better profits for the insurance companiesIndeed with Medicare Advantage there is a rebate given to eachinsurance company This is not the case with traditional Medicare Therebate was designed essentially to provide again lower cost access tohealth care benefits for the consumers of Medicare AdvantageThe GAO found that 19 percent of Medicare Advantage beneficiariesactually pay more than traditional Medicare for home health care and 16percent pay more for inpatient services Here is the irony We arepaying the insurance companies more but the beneficiaries of MedicareAdvantage are indeed are also paying more So there is no costsavings in this regard in this program at leastThe other point which is I think critical and I alluded to is thatfor the same services you receive in Medicare Advantage there is onaverage a 14percent increase overall for those similar services intraditional MedicareWe have to I think take tough steps to eliminate these overpayments but steps that will enhance the quality of care for seniorsand that is what is being done in this bill While some of theseresources are being used to help redesign a system for all Americansthere will also be significant improvements for seniors for care thatis more effective and efficient and less costlyLet me suggest something else We are all paying right now for thecost of uninsured Americans It has been estimated that every privateinsurance plan in this country is payingevery individual payerbusinesses or individualabout 1000 a year for uncompensated careThat is the cost hospitals shift from their uncompensated care on tothe insurance providers the carriers and that is translated intohigher premiums for all AmericansUnder this legislation the hospitals will now see patientspresenting themselves with an insurance card Mr President over 94percent of Americans it has been estimated will be covered under ourproposal So instead of showing up for free care they will be under aninsurance plan The hospitals will benefit Medicare Medicaid and thewhole health care system will benefitAgain this is one of the changes that would be reversed by theMCCain motionAlso we have taken steps so that hospitals will be much moreeffective in managing their patient flow Readmissions will hopefullybe reduced by some of the provisions in this legislationThere are many things we should do and will do but I believe we cansuccessfully balance expanding our coverage system protecting qualityof care but also recognizing as has been suggested the fiscalimplications not just for the moment but going forward I suggest ifsomeone is serious about entitlement control serious about the fiscalimplications of this legislation or any other legislation they willnot simply order the committee to restore these cuts They would dosomething much more proactive and indeed support what I believe aresensible sound proposals to provide quality to ensure that over thelong run Medicare is more solventIn factthe final pointthe legislation before us would extend thelife of Medicare the solvency of Medicare over at least 5 years Sofor those people who say we are trying to end Medicare their solutionis simply to let it go bankrupt apparently in 2017 or to simply ignoreit and let it find its own fateWe can do better I urge rejection of the MCCain motion I yield thefloorThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Udall of New Mexico The Senator fromWyoming is recognized  President I ask unanimous

BINGAMAN for himself Mr Isakson and Mr KohlS 2832 A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Actof 1974 to require a lifetime income disclosure to the Committee onHealth Education Labor and Pensions  President I rise today to introduce the TransitionalFederal Medical Assistance Percentage FMAP Act and I am pleased todo so with the support of Senators Brown Whitehouse Akaka DurbinKlobuchar and Begich This bill is an important step in continuing theconversation about how we can help our States businesses andindividuals as our economy recoversIn my State of Rhode Island the economic downturn has beenparticularly hard hitting on families and businesses As a result theState has seen a decline in tax revenue and an increased enrollment insafety net programs like Medicaid Revenue from the sales tax is downover 7 percent income tax receipts are down 23 percent and corporatetax revenue is down nearly 10 percent At the same time unemploymentrates have soared to new heights topping 13 percent earlier this yearIn the past 2 years 40000 Rhode Islanders have lost their employersponsored health insurance Many of these individuals have come to relyon Medicaid for health coverage This has caused great strain on theStates resources and its Medicaid program In November we learnedthat the estimated Medicaid caseload for the year will cost over 40million more than what the State had initially estimated in its budgetThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act which I supportedprovided States with additional Federal assistance through 2010 Stateshave used these funds to help balance their budgets minimize harmfulcuts in public services and very importantly to prevent taxincreases in many cases However even with the funding from theRecovery Act Rhode Island will close the current fiscal year 2198million in the redA total of 38 States have looked ahead to fiscal year 2011 and theyhave estimated 92 billion in combined deficits in the coming year Asthe State fiscal year nears and more States have had ample time toanalyze their fiscal health it is expected that the total shortfallwill likely equal 180 billionAs Congress debates health reform and works to ensure that everyAmerican has access to health insurance in 2014 we must not forgetabout ensuring that Americans have access to health insurance betweennow and then as the economy slowly recovers and as state budgets beginto heal During this tough time we need to help individualsbusinesses and States and I am particularly concerned with makingsure our States have the resources to provide adequate health careUnless Congress acts on FMAP legislation States will be forced touse their limited resources to cover an expanded Medicaid populationbeginning in January 2011 Since States are planning their fiscal year2011 budgets which will begin in July many Governors are requestingCongress act now to provide States with additional Federal supportThe Transitional FMAP Act would extend the enhanced FMAP fundingwhich we passed in the Recovery Act for two additional quarters Thisextension accounts for the prolonged recession and ensures that thepressure of Medicaid needs do not overwhelm the States The bill wouldalso begin a slow decrease of enhanced FMAP funding from July 2011through December 2013 This will help States as they recover and ensurethat States do not experience a gap in assistance prior to healthreformrelated FMAP levels beginning in January 2014Mr President this additional funding is important for Statesbusinesses and individuals I know that Chairman Baucus and LeaderReid are well aware of the importance of FMAP and have a history toworking to aid our States I look forward to working with them and myother colleagues to provide States with necessary

S_AK_MURKOWSKI,2009-12-22, Madam President I want to speak about smallbusinesses because we have all been talking about the impact to smallbusinesses Under this bill as we know small businesses are going tobe penalized 750 per employee if even one of their employees seeksgovernmental health care through Medicaid or through Federal subsidiesSo if you have 50 or more employees you can be expected to pay finesin an amount of 750 per employee which amounts to over 37000 or3000 for that individual employeeI think we need to put it into perspective in terms of who thesebusinesses are These are the solopractitioners like the onelawyeroffice or the small doctors office If these individuals purchasehealth care in the individual market they are going to see theirpremiums go up an extra 1160 per year for a familynearly 3000more in 2016Alaska is defined as a highcost State If you are a small businessthat can afford to pay good health and dental benefits for youremployees and those benefits amount to 8500 per individual or 23000per family in a highcost State such as Alaska you look to be hitwith a 40percent excise tax because you basically want to provide youremployees with good benefitsAgain according to ISERAlaska is a high cost state and thus roughly 50 percent ofhealth plans in Alaska will be subject to the tax by 2016compared to only 19 percent average in the Lower 48Again by 2016 50 percent of the plans in my State will be subjectto this 40percent excise taxI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter wereceived from the municipality of Anchorage Police and Fire RetireeMedical TrustThere being no objection the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record as followsMunicipality of Anchorage Police  Fire Retiree MedicalTrustDecember

Future Act of 2009 alsocontains these changes and could become effective January 12010Three provisions in the bill that are of particular concernare1 Inclusion of health care benefits as taxable

health plan designis apt to be considered to have an excess benefit Thiswould make it subject to a 40 excise tax There is also anaggregation rule for the value of employee coverage withmultiple employers or retiree medical example veterans andrehired police officers and fire fighters If a retireewould purchase MOA Health Insurance that is consideredexcessive the 40 excise tax would be incurred by thegeneral fund of the Medical Trust One may argue that the taxis a tax to the employer The argument can also be made thatthe Trust is an integral part of the Municipality This was aconclusion determined in IRS PLR0616496 Thus the tax wouldbe payable from the Trust general fund assetsSEC 9001 EXCISE TAX ON HIGH COST EMPLOYERSPONSOREDHEALTH COVERAGE P 1979any excess benefit with

counter OTC medicine Retiredpolice officers and fire fighters also currently are allowedthis reimbursement as part of their medical benefit Underthe rules of this bill these reimbursements would no

DISTRIBUTIONS FOR MEDICINE QUALIFIED ONLY IF FORPRESCRIBED DRUG OR INSULIN p 1997This bill contains expenses that should be considered andplanned for accordingly A December 2009 press release

PatientProtection and Affordable Care Act unveiled November 18Mercer estimates that one in five employers offer healthcoverage that would be deemed too generous and thus besubject to the Acts 40 percent nondeductible tax on theexcess valueTwo letters have been sent to the MOA informing them ofthese matters The dates of these letters were November 25and December 5 2009 Since then Larry Baker Senior PolicyAdvisor in the Mayors Office informed me that the MOAsbenefit consultant The Wilson Agency affirmed that thecurrent MOA health plans are going to be subject to the 40excise tax They are contacting Senator Begich but beyondthat he did not specify what the course of action was goingto beI recommend two points of action Bring the PFRMTmembership up to date of this situation And contact SenatorBegich to inform him of the negative impact that these billswill have on our retired police officers and fire fightersmedical benefitSincerelyLorne BretzPlan AdministratorWe received this letter last week In the letter they citespecifically three provisions in the bill that are of particularconcernNo 1 inclusion of health care benefits as taxable income toemployeesIt statesNot only will this increase the employees taxable incomebut the Municipality of Anchorages payroll tax will alsoincreaseThe second point is the taxation of the municipalitys health careplansThis tax will be imposed on the employer The currentmunicipality health plan design is apt to be considered tohave an excess benefit This would make it subject to a40 excise taxThey go on to sayThere is also an aggregation rule for the value of employeecoverage with multiple employers or retiree medical If aretiree would purchase the municipalitys Health Insurancethat is considered excessive the 40 excise tax would beincurredOne may argue that the tax is a tax to the employer Theargument can also be made that the Trust is an integral partof the Municipality Thus the tax would be payable from theTrust general fund assetsTheir third point isCurrent municipal employees are able to be reimbursed taxfree from money they have placed in their flexible spendingaccount for over the counter medicine Retired policeofficers and firefighters also currently are allowed thisreimbursement as part of their medical benefit Under therules of this bill these reimbursements would no longer beallowed This is a reduction in employee benefits It is alsolikely to encourage an increase in the utilization of moreexpensive nonOTC prescriptions as they are a coveredexpenseThere are about 400 members that are part of the Police and FireRetiree Medical Trust When they find out as I am sure they will thatessentially they are going to be taxed on their planI think most ofthese firefighters and police officers dont view themselves as havingaccess to a Cadillac plan They are just firefighters and policeofficers But this is coming from their trust fund expressing greatconcern over what we have in front of usI have mentioned that we have received a copy of an opinion piecefrom a primary care provider in Anchorage who has outlined why she isopting out of the Medicare system in AlaskaI ask unanimous consent to have her letter printed in the RecordThere being no objection the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record as followsFrom the Anchorage Daily News Dec 18 2009Opinion Doctors and Patients Not Feds Know BestBy Ilona Farr MDI have made the heartwrenching decision as a physician toopt out of Medicare I do so after working with Sen StevensSen Murkowski and Rep Young for a decade in hopes we

physiciansadministrative burdens promote electronic medical recordswith mandated reporting of outcomes data and increasebusiness costs so it will be impossible for small practicesto surviveMy decision to withdraw from Medicare was also precipitatedby US Preventive Services Task Forces recommendation thatbreast cancer screening mammograms should only be done onwomen between age 50 and 74 Approximately 48 percent of mypatients with breast cancer developed it before age 50 Up to12 percent of my practice mostly young mothers could havedied if this were a national guidelineThe Senate bill has this task force and other committeesdetermining what tests will be covered for patients I amconcerned that penalties may be imposed on insurancecompanies and maybe providers for going against theseguidelines The Hippocratic Oath compels us to protect thehealth of all humans throughout life and many provisions inthese health care bills would cause us to violate that oathPhysicians and patients not government should decide thebest most costeffective medical treatment for patientsGovernment should not dictate to insurance companies orproviders which tests can or cannot be covered Medicine ischanging too rapidly for guidelines to be made at a nationallevelI have worked in government medical facilities and inprivate practice for the last 26 years Physicians providetimelier less costly and more patientoriented care if notoverseen by hordes of nonproducing governmentadministratorsI am in favor of reform but current bills before Congresswill collapse our health care system and work against thefreedoms we are guaranteed under the Constitution Governmentshould not be allowed to force people to purchase healthinsurance mandate what health care services you are allowedor increase our taxes astronomically to support a hugegovernment health care bureaucracy that will bankrupt us asindividuals and as a nation One of the things we dont have in this legislation isa provision that relates to medical malpractice It has been statedthat in Alaska you tried medical malpractice reform and we haventseen the positive impactsI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statementfrom the Alaska State Medical Association along with an article thatwas published in Alaska Medicine in September of 2009 entitledMalpractice Relief Lower Premiums Tort Reform Add to AlaskasAppealThere being no objection the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record as followsAlaska Physicians Group Senator Erred on Tort ReformAnchorage Alaska Dec 21 2009The Alaska State MedicalAssociation ASMA which represents physicians throughoutAlaska and is primarily concerned with the health of allAlaskans is taking issue with Sen Mark Begichs stance onmedical liability reformIn an interview with Fox News on Dec 7 2009 Alaskasjunior senator opined that tort reform in his home state hasnot worked ASMA asserts that Begich did not accuratelyportray the facts in that nationally broadcast interview andthat medical liability reform in Alaska serves as a shiningexample for the other 49 statesAlaskas physicians have worked hard for at least thelast 35 years to achieve meaningful and equitable liabilityreform measures ASMA President Brion J Beerle MD wrotetoday in a letter to Sen Begich Those efforts haveresulted in a stable marketplace for insurers that providemedical professional liability coverage to Alaskasphysicians at rates that are competitiveMore than 90 of medical liability coverage in Alaska isprovided by two notforprofit insurersMIEC and NORCALthat are owned by their policyholders mutual insurers andoverseen by boards of governors all of whom are physicianswith representation on those boards by Alaska physiciansThe cumulative result of the Alaska physicians advocacyhas been a success for physicians and their patientsBeerle wrote For example according to the MedicalLiability Monitor Survey 2008 premiums paid by Alaskasinternists average just 24 of those paid by the interests inthe five most expensive states general surgeons pay about25 and obstetriciansgynecologists pay about 31 Accordingto that same 2008 survey the premiums for those samespecialties are in the lowest quartile of all states plus theDistrict of ColumbiaMIEC also has returned excess earnings to itspolicyholders in 16 of the last 19 years and NORCALpolicyholders received dividends in 12 of the last 18 yearsMIEC has in addition reduced its rates by 5 in 2009 andalso for 2010 the ASMA president addedWriting on behalf of the association he leads Beerle notedthat because of tort reform premiums Alaskas physicians payfor liability coverage is generally not significant in thecost of operating a medical practiceThe factor that does have a material effect is the costof practicing defensive medicine he wroteThe American Medical Association has estimated that theannual cost of the practice of defensive medicine in theUnited States ranges from 99 billion to 179 billionUntil medical liability reforms similar to those enactedin Alaska are adopted nationwide the additional costs of thepractice of defensive medicine will continue to be a driverin the cost of health care in Alaska and throughout thecountry Beerle concludedFrom Alaska Medicine Sept 2009Malpractice ReliefBy Andrew Firth and Roger HolmesIt is seemingly a universal truth that wherever onepractices in the United States malpractice insurance coststoo much But in Alaska the average medical malpracticepremiums are lower than at least 35 other states a nationalsurvey showsPhysicians in Alaska pay much less than their colleagues inthe nations five most costly states according to theMedical Liability Monitor Survey 2008 Premiums paid byAlaskas internists average 24 percent of those paid byinternists in the five highest states surgeons here payroughly 25 percent and obstetriciangynecologists pay about31 percent The top five states vary by specialty Some ofthe difference in cost may be societal but part of it has todo with the tort reforms that have passed or not passed ineach stateIn Alaska our history is similar to many states where thecosts are lower Its a state with an active medical societythe Alaska State Medical Association an engagedmembership a broad coalition of providers and an enlightenedlegislative body that recognizes the connection betweenmalpractice costs and access to careIn 1975 Alaskan physicians suddenly were confronted with adisappearing market for medical malpractice insurance TheLegislature stepped in and created the Medical IndemnityCorporation of Alaska MICA a quasistate agency fundedwith state money but run by a private board of directorsappointed by the governor At the same time the Legislaturemodified the law governing medical malpractice claims Amongthe key changesThe burden of proof was codified making it clear that apractitioner could only be judged against those in the samefield or specialtyRes ipso loquitur a legal doctrine that switched theburden of proof to the healthcare provider in certaininstances was abolishedThe law required that juries be told that injury alone doesnot raise a presumption of negligence or misconductPlaintiffs were prohibited from filing inflammatorypleadings asking for millions of dollarsThe law of informed consent was codifiedThe law prohibited claims that a healthcare provider hadorally agreed to achieve a specific medical resultPlaintiffs were prohibited from obtaining a recovery forsums that had been paid by collateral sources except for aselect few federal programs that must by law seekreimbursementDuring the 1970s and 80s physicians encountered rising andfalling malpractice costs as the insurance cycle reacted tochanging claim experience in Alaska and elsewhereculminating in the departure of several medical professionalliability MPL insurers in the late 1990sIn the mid1990s the Alaska State Medical Association andseveral MPL insurers joined with the Alaska State Hospitaland Nursing Home Association Providence Hospital and thebusiness community to press for additional tort reforms Theresult was the 1997 Tort Reform ActAmong its achievements was a cap on noneconomic damages of400000 except in cases of severe disfigurement or severepermanent impairment in which the cap rises to 1 millionPunitive damages were limited and the standards forawarding them were tightened Prejudgment interest was tiedto the federal discount rateAlaskas current rate is 325percent Joint and several liability was abolished in favorof comparative fault in which each party is responsible onlyfor its percentage share of the total fault And parties wereprohibited from using experts in medical malpractice casesunless the expert is licensed trained and experienced in thesame discipline or school of practice as the physician andcertified by a recognized boardA coalition called Alaskans for Access to Health Carecomprising ASMA Alaska Physicians  Surgeons the hospitalassociation and Providencewent back to the Legislature in2005 and argued for an even lower noneconomic damage cap forhealthcare providers The result was a limit of 250000 inall cases except when damages are awarded for wrongful deathor a severe permanent physical impairment that is more that70 percent disabling For those the limit is 400000Since then Alaska has enjoyed a stable malpracticeclimate with both of its major insurance carriers reducingrates andor returning profits through dividenddistributionsThe caps make a big difference For example NORCAL Mutualwhich writes policies in Alaska and California also doesbusiness in Rhode Island which does not limit noneconomicdamages in malpractice casesMost rates for physicians with at least three yearspractice experience mature rates in Rhode Island are atleast double the mature rates for physicians in AlaskaNORCAL Marketing and Communications Manager Brent Samodurovwrote in an email to Alaska Medicine For several medicalspecialties NORCAL Mutuals rates for Rhode Island are nearlytriple those for AlaskaMPL carriersThere are two major MPL insurers in Alaska MIEC andNORCAL Both companies are owned by their policyholdersmutual insurers and are overseen by a board of governorsconsisting of physiciansMIEC came to Alaska in 1978 and is sponsored by ASMANORCAL became active in 1991 after it purchased MICAAccording to data published by the National Association ofInsurance Commissioners MIEC wrote 697 percent of allmedical malpractice premiums for physicians in the stateduring 2008 and NORCAL wrote 234 percent Ten other carriersshared the remaining 69 percent of the marketTypical of these types of policyholderowned companiesboth MIEC and NORCAL have a long history of returning profitsto policyholders through dividend distributionsNORCALs Alaska clients have received dividends in 12 ofthe past 18 years the most recent amounting to 12 percent ofeach eligible policyholders premium as of Sept 30 2008according to Samodurov He noted Dividends declared aredirectly related to the companys loss experience in eachstateMIEC has a similar record of returning profits to itsAlaska members MIEC policyholders have received dividends in16 of the past 19 years in amounts that average 288 percentof basic premiums for 1 million3 million limits in eachone of the past 19 years The bottom line is from the Alaska State MedicalAssociationThe cumulative result of Alaska physicians advocacy hasbeen a success for physicians and their patientsAgain we have seen the positive impact in Alaska because of the lawswe have passed It is unfortunate that we didnt take that opportunityas we dealt with health care reform these past many monthsI yield the floorExhibit 1December 21 2009US SenateWashington DCDear Senator We are writing to express our strongopposition to language contained in the Managers Amendmentto HR 3590 which excludes the construction industry fromthe small business exemption contained in the bill We regretthat this is our first opportunity to address this issuethough thefact that the Managers Amendment was made public less thantwo days before the first vote on the matter has increasedthe difficulty of playing a constructive role in thelegislative processIn recognition of the negative impact that a mandate toprovide health insurance will have on employers HR 3590exempts employers with fewer than 50 employees from the fineslevied on those who cannot afford to provide their employeeswith the federal minimum standard of health insuranceHowever the Managers Amendment singles out the constructionindustry by altering the exemption so that it applies to onlythose firms with fewer than 5 employeesThis narrowly focused provision is an unprecedented assaulton our industry and the men and women who every day make thebold decision to strike out on their own by starting abusiness Our members benefit packages reflect the realityof their business models and they proudly offer the besthealth insurance coverage that they can afford It isunreasonable to presume that small business owners can bearthe increased cost of these new benefits simply becauseCongress mandates that they do soIn the real world where the rhetoric surrounding thislegislation will meet the stark reality of the employerstruggling to make payroll this special interest carve outis simply another bill to pay in an industry that with anunemployment rate exceeding 18 and more than 200 billion ineconomic activity lost in the past year already isstruggling to surviveAnd we would be remiss if we failed to question thejustification for singling out the construction industry tobear such a burden We are unaware of any data or evidencethat suggests that the needs and struggles of a constructioncontractor with fewer than 50 employees are so different fromthose of small business owners in other industries andabsent such convincing evidence we are left to assume thatthis specific provision is merely a political payoff tosatisfy the desires of a small constituencyAs Congress moves forward in the legislative process forHR 3590 we strongly encourage you to address this onerousprovision that needlessly singles out small constructionindustry employersSincerelyAir Conditioning Contractors of America American Instituteof Architects Associated Builders and

articulate comments of my friend from Florida We recognize thathis time in the Senate has been relatively short but in terms of anindividual jumping in with both feet and embracing the challenges weclearly have in front of us and representing the constituents of theState of Florida in the manner he has I think that deserves publicrecognition and I thank the Senator for his leadershipWe have had occasion to talk about the similarities between Alaskaand Florida You might not think there would be much in relationshiptheremy being from the North and the cold versus the sunny South inFlorida But when it comes to our senior populations this is where wetruly have a shared interest Florida has probably the largest numberof seniors per capita and in my State of Alaska we are the State thathas the fastest growing population of seniors per capitaOne might not think of Alaska as being a retirement haven but moreand more we are becoming so and we share the same problems when itcomes to access When you cant get in to see a provider when thatinsurance card is all we have given you then we havent done anythingto provide for a level of care to improve the situation for theresidents of Florida or the residents of Alaska So what we are doingtodayas we move toward final passage on legislation that I wouldconcur with the Senator from Florida does not fix the problemwe arenot dealing with how we appropriately and adequately provide for accessto quality health care We have much work remaining before usWe have had some time these past couple daysactually these pastcouple weeksas we have spent a considerable amount of time in ouroffices waiting for votes at 1 in the morning or votes at 7 oclock inthe morning and I have had a chance to go through some things on mydesk but I have also had an opportunity to spend a lot of timechecking to see what people are saying when they are contacting ouroffice The volume of correspondence whether in emails or faxes orphone calls coming in from Alaskans during this time has beenabsolutely unprecedentedI think typically in the legislative calendar about this timeseveral days before Christmasyou dont see constituents contactingtheir Senators and pounding the drum Well let me tell you the peoplein Alaska are pounding the drum In just the past 24 hours we havegotten probably close to about 500 health care emails that have comein Overwhelmingly these are emails from constituents saying No thisis not good You must do what you can to prevent this reform packageas you call it from moving forwardIt seems the longer the people from Alaska the longer the peoplefrom around this country have to look at what is contained in this2000plus page bill the more they realize the negative impacts theconsequences to them and their families and their businesses and theyare no longer silent I have had so many calls and letters coming frompeople saying I have never weighed in with you before never weighedin with my delegation but this is something I cant keep silent onWhen you look at some of the ones that have come in these are justtodays This is one from a woman in Anchorage who says Yesterday onthe TV news I heard about the sweetheart deal Senator Nelson maderegarding the rest of us paying Nebraskas Medicare bill forever Tosay I am angry is putting it mildlyThere is a gentleman in Fairbanks who writes in I am very skepticalabout this mandatory health insurance that apparently everyone willhave to buy inHere is one from a fellow in Anchorage also He says You are movinga health care bill that cant be understood unless a person has a lawdegreeAnother individual and this is an interesting one He and his familyapparently own four indoor tanning businesses in Alaska We need to geta little sunshine even if it is not what God has provided us Butthese are good businesses and he says When did this go from a 5percent tax increase for cosmetic surgery to 10 percent for indoortanning anyway And he adds Adding another 10percent tax hike onsmall businesses like indoor tanning will likely drive many familiesjust like mine into bankruptcyI could go on and on in terms of the stacks of correspondence andphone calls we have gotten but suffice it to say the more peopleunderstand what is in this legislation the greater their concerns areand the greater their outrage as they learn what is contained in itOne of the things I learned just yesterday which I dont think wehave gotten the focus or the attention onand this is a concern thatwas raised by the Anchorage homebuilders and the Alaska State HomeBuilding Association They have pointed out that as an industry thehomebuilders industry they are being unfairly singled out in thisbillWe have talked about the employer mandate that is contained in thislegislation and that mandate applies to those businesses with 50 ormore employees But there is a zing in this legislation to homebuilderswho are now responsible for providing federally approved healthbenefits if they have five or more employeesLook at what is going on throughout this country in terms ofindustries that have taken a real hit with this economic downturn andthis recession The homebuilding industry has suffered incrediblyduring this downturn On top of depressed house prices and increases inhome foreclosures now we are now going to punish them with an employermandate that treats them worse than any other employer In other wordsif you have five or more employees as a homebuilder you need to knowthat your industry is the one the only one that will be subject to theemployer mandate of 750 per employeeIn Alaska we checked to see how many individuals are homebuilderswithin the State We have about 250 homebuilders in Alaska But whenyou look to see how many individuals they employ that is about 3078employees it is about 12 employees to every builder So the totalhomebuilding industry that would be impacted is about 800 employers inmy StateYesterday there was a letter sent to Members of the Senate This isfrom the homebuilding industry as well as many other associatedindustriesthe airconditioning contractors the builders andcontractors the electrical contractors I wish to mention some of thestatements that are contained in this letter Again it is writtenyesterday They sayWe are writing to express our strong opposition to languagecontained in the managers amendment which excludes theconstruction industry from the small business exemptioncontained in the bill The fact that the managers amendmentwas made public less than 2 days before the first vote on thematter has increased the difficulty of playing a constructiverole in the legislative processI will take a little detour from the letter This is part of theproblem You have these organizations and groups and there is a listof about a dozen of them here that have signed on to this letter Theyhad literally hours before we were forced to vote on the managersamendment They did not know what was in the bill and how it impactedthem They go on to sayThe managers amendment singles out the constructionindustry by altering the exemption so it applies only tofirms with fewer than 5 employees This is an unprecedentedassault on our industry It is unreasonable to presume thatsmall business owners can bearthe increased costs of these new benefits simply becauseCongress mandates that they do soThey go on to conclude in the letterWe are unaware of any data or evidence that suggests thatthe needs and struggles of a construction contractor withfewer than 50 employees are so different from those of smallbusiness owners in other industries and absent suchconvincing evidence we are left to assume that this specificprovision is merely a political payoff to satisfy the desiresof a small constituencyThose are some pretty strong words there toward the end But it doescause you to wonder why in this legislation we are going to requirethat businessesonly businesses in excess of 50 employees are going tobe subject to this mandate Why this unprecedented assault on thehomebuilders I dont get it But what it does cause me to get is thatthere is a heck of a lot more out there that the more we read it themore we sit down and we connect the dots the more we realize this fishwe have set out on the front porch is going to continue to stinkIt stuns me We have the homebuilders up in Alaska who are besidethemselves saying Can you take a look at this and let me know how theSenators feel What are you going to do about this Lisa is thequestion I have receivedThis is something we all have to reckon withMadam President at the conclusion of my remarks I ask unanimousconsent that a copy of the letter be printed in the RecordThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mrs Shaheen Without objection it is soorderedSee Exhibit 1 I am going to speak a little bit about how aspects ofthis legislation have impact specifically on my State As a ruralState sometimes the impacts we see are different than you have in moreurban States Our geography is different our lack of providers ourhigh senior population our extremely expensive costs there are a lotof dynamics at play that cause real issues and real concernsThere have been many words that have been exchanged on this floorabout what this bill doesnt do or what it does do I find it helpfulto go to the experts the think tank in my State and ask them flatout We have an institution at the University of Alaska called theInstitute of Social Economic Research I take what they have to sayvery seriouslyI also take very seriously what our Congressional Budget Office hasto say what the CMS Actuary has to say because as my colleague fromFlorida pointed out these are the independent arbiters These are theguys whose job it is to work the numbers I would like to discuss someof the findings from the University of Alaska and also try to inject alittle bit of common sense into the debate as to what it means forAlaska how it increases their premiums how it raises that cost curveon the Federal health care expenses the taxes on small businesses forthe individuals the families the health benefits of the police thefirefighters other public protective service people who put theirlives on the line for so many These are the things about whichunfortunately we might not be getting the full pictureOur colleagues on the other side have claimed that health carecoverage will be expanded Again lets go to our nonpartisanentitiesthe CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation The averagepremium per person if you purchase in the individual market is goingto be 10 to 13 percent higher in 2016 than the average premium undercurrent law That tells you if these Federal scorekeepers are correctyour premiums are going to go up under this health bill if you buyinsurance yourselfIn Alaska according to ISERagain the Institute for Social andEconomic Researchyou have about 28000 Alaskans who would pay 12percent more for their premiums It is going to cost an individual inmy State an extra 1100 per year and a family in my State nearly3000 more per year for the coverage by 2016Again you have to ask the question Is health care expanding Thisbill forces you to purchase federally approved health care otherwiseyou have to pay the penalty of 750 or 2 percent of your income if youearn more than 37500If you look at Alaskas population this is going to bring in morethan 50 percent of Alaskas population who are going to be penalized ifthey fail to have health insurance Again you ask the question Ishealth care coverage going to be expandedSince the law we are advancing is going to require that you buyfederally approved health insurance and then we are going to penalizeyou if you do not buy it then what you have is the heavy hand of theFederal Government that forces you to buy health insurance which isgoing to cost about 12 percent more once this bill is enacted12percent more than it would todayThe Democrats will also talk about the hidden tax on families and howthat will go away because once this bill passes under this billeveryone is going to have coverage Alaskans and all Americans who donot get federally approved health insurance that the Federal Governmentis going to require that you have they are going to be fined 750 2percent of your taxable income and what the Democrats will not tellyou when they say health care coverage is going to be expanded or thehidden tax is going to go away is those with income greater than37500again affecting over 50 percent of the people in my Stateare going to be taxed a full 2 percent of their household income oncethe bill is fully phased in if they do not get health insurance It isthis penalty that is going to raise 15 billion to help pay for thisbill This is how we are paying for the billCBO and CMS told us the taxes on medical deviceswhether they aretongue depressors or xrays or blood sugar metersthese are going tobe passed on to the individuals so you are going to be taxed for vitalmedications and other health products The question you then have toask yourself OK so do these hidden costs actually go awayI suppose they do because they are no longer hidden What we willhave done is we will have raised your premiums we will have increasedthe penalties on those earning more than 37500 who did not buy intohealth insurance and we will have taxed your tongue depressors and xrays to pay for the billIn addition the smallest of the small businesses are going to betaxed if they do not provide insurance for their employees andindividuals and couples earning over 200000 they are going to bepenalized because they are the higher income earnersThe Democrats are also telling you that as Medicare patients theyare going to get some good positive things They will get freepreventive services This is good This is absolutely great We shouldbe encouraging preventive servicesBut as my colleague from Florida was explaining as I mentionedafter this bill passes are any of the 13I think we are down to only12 nowprimary care doctors in Alaska in the Anchorage area anywayaccepting new Medicare patients We are saying we are going to providethis service to you at no cost But again if you cant get anybodywho will take you as a patient how are we helping you We have heardfrom a doctor in Anchorage In fact I have an opinion piece that waspublished just this week in the Anchorage Daily News She indicates sheis dropping out of Medicare and she is doing it because of thislegislationI ask unanimous consent that be printed in the RecordThere being no objection the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record as followsFrom the Anchorage Daily News Dec 18 2009OPINION Doctors and Patients Not Feds Know BestBy Ilona Farr MDI have made the heartwrenching

developed it before age 50 Up to12 percent of my practice mostly young mothers could havedied if this were a national guidelineThe Senate bill has this task force and other committeesdetermining what tests will be covered for patients I amconcerned that penalties may be imposed on insurancecompanies and maybe providers for going against theseguidelines The Hippocratic Oath compels us to protect thehealth of all humans throughout life and many provisions inthese health care bills would cause us to violate that oathPhysicians and patients not government should decide thebest most costeffective medical treatment for patientsGovernment should not dictate to insurance companies orproviders which tests can or cannot be covered Medicine ischanging too rapidly for guidelines to be made at a nationallevelI have worked in government medical facilities and inprivate practice for the last 26 years Physicians providetimelier less costly and more patientoriented care if notoverseen by hordes of nonproducing governmentadministratorsI am in favor of reform but current bills before Congresswill collapse our health care system and work against thefreedoms we are guaranteed under the Constitution Governmentshould not be allowed to force people to purchase healthinsurance mandate what health care services you are allowedor increase our taxes astronomically to support a hugegovernment health care bureaucracy that will bankrupt us asindividuals and as a nation It is no secret in my State of Alaska and in far toomany States around this country we do not have enough providers thatwill take these individuals ISER has said seniors in low paymentMedicare States will be forced to wait in line Alaska is one of twoStateswe are I think second to last in terms of Medicare paymentsand where we stack up in relation to the reimbursement ISER goes on tostateIndependent of the doc fix in Alaska the remainder ofseniors are at risk of long lines to see a primary caredoctor and overflowing to community health center andhospital emergency rooms where existing capacity is highlylikely to be quickly overwhelmed and long wait times becomeincreasingly commonISER has also said that additional new insured patients are going tohurt Medicare beneficiaries and they stateFederal healthcare reform applied to Alaska likely willexacerbate an already very challenging situation for Alaskasseniors as baby boomers age into Medicare and findingthemselves waiting in line behind a rapidly expanding line ofbetter paying private plansWe are told 5 years from now our Medicare population is going toincrease by 50 percent We cannot accommodate those who are Medicareeligible now Our boom is not sustainableThe CMS Actuary has saidThe Reid bill reduces payments to health care providerswhich is unlikely to be sustainable on a permanent basis Asa result providers could find it difficult to remainprofitable and absent legislative intervention might endtheir participation in the Medicare programIt is happening Doctors providers physicians are making thosedecisions as we speak They are opting out So this is not sometheoretical approach to the problem This is happeningMadam President how much time do we have on our side If I may ask my colleague from Kansas do I understandthe Senator is seeking about 10 minutes
S_NH_GREGG,2009-12-02, They are using to fund the underlying bill and theunderlying bill expands a variety of initiatives in the area ofMedicaid and in the area of a brandnew entitlement for people who areuninsured to subsidize the government plan  The CLASS Act is another classic gimmick of budgetaryshenanigans which I would like to speak to briefly I know the Senatorfrom Montana had a question or maybe he has gone past that point and wehave answered all his questions I can move on to the CLASS Act  TheCLASS Act needs to be explained It is a great title We come up withthese wonderful motherhood of titles We attach them to things andthen suddenly they take on a persona that has no relationship to whatthey actually do The CLASS Act is a longterm care insurance programwhich will be government run It is another takeover of private sectoractivity by the Federal Government But what is extraordinarilyirresponsible in this bill is we all know in longterm care insurancethat you buy it when you are in your thirties and your forties Youprobably dont buy it when you are in your twenties You buy it in yourthirties forties and fifties You start paying in premiums then Butyou dont take the benefits The cost of those insurance products dontincur to the insurer until people actually go into the retirement homesituation which is in their late sixties and seventies most likelyeighties in our culture today where many people are working well intotheir seventies So there is a large period of people paying in andthen 30 or 40 years later they start to take outWhat has happened in this bill which is a classic Ponzi schemeinfact ironically the chairman of the Budget Committee did call it aPonzi scheme the Senator from North Dakota Mr Conradthey arescoring these years when people are paying into this new program andbecause the program doesnt exist everybody who pays into it startingwith day one the beneficiaries of that program arent going to occuruntil probably 30 or 40 years later They are taking all the money thatis paid in when people are in their thirties forties fifties andsixties as premiums They are taking that money and they are scoring itas revenue under this bill and they are spending it on otherprogrammatic initiatives for the purposes of claiming the bill isbalanced It adds up to about 212 billion over that 20year period2010 to 2029OK So you spend all the premium money What happens when thesepeople do go into the nursing home do require longterm care when theybecome 75 80 90 years old There is no money It has been spent Ithas been spent on something else on a new entitlement on expandingcare to people under Medicaid on whatever the bill has in it So weare going to have this huge bill that is going to come due to our kidsone more time We already are sticking them with 12 trillion of debtright now and we are going to raise the debt ceiling sometime in thenext month to I dont know what it is going to be but I have heardrumors it may be as high as 13 more trillion We know we have another9 trillion of debt coming at us just by the budgets projected for thenext 10 years Now we are going to 30 years from now have this hugebill come in as the people who decided to buy into the CLASS Actsuddenly go into the retirement home There will not be any money therefor them It is gone It will have been spent by a prior generation tomake this bill balancedThe CLASS Act has been described as a Ponzi scheme relative to itseffect on the budget It is using dollars which should be segregatedand protected under an insurance program If this were an insurancecompany for example they would actually have to invest those dollarsin something that would be an asset which would be available to pay forthe person when they go into the nursing home so they are actuariallysound But that is not what happens under this bill Under this billthose dollars go out the door as soon as they come in for the purposesof representing that this bill is in fiscal balance It is not It isnot in fiscal balance obviouslyEven if you were to accept these incredible activities of budgetarygimmickry the fundamental problem with this bill is it grows thegovernment by 25 trillion and we cant afford that when we alreadyhave a government that well exceeds our capacity to pay for itInevitably we will pass on to these young pages as they go into theirearning careers and raise their families a government that is soexpensive they will be unable to buy a home send their kids tocollege or do the things they wish to do that give one a quality oflifeI have certainly taken more than my fair share of time at this pointThe Senator from Louisiana was going to go nextI yield the floor  Madam President it is the tradition in this body that aperson seeking recognition gets recognized is it not  Madam President I ask unanimous consent that at theconclusion of remarks of the Senator from California I be recognized  President I ask unanimous consent that the nextRepublican speaker be the Senator from Louisiana Senator Vitter President at this point I rise to speak generallyaboutthe bill and specifically about this Medicare proposalthe proposal inthe bill and the motion that has been offered by Senator MCCain whichI think is an excellent ideaLets start with the size of this bill It is unusual that we wouldbe considering a bill of this size and not have had more time to take alook at it but the bill itselfand I am glad that the chairman of theFinance Committee has essentially agreed with this earlier todaycosts25 trillion when it is fully implemented25 trillion When mybudget staff took a look at this billand we only had a brief time todo it obviously last weekand came up with that number people onthe other side of the aisle said regrettably No that is a bogusnumber The number is 840 billion it is not a 25 trillion billHowever it is 25 trillion when it is fully implemented When theprogrammatic activity of this bill is under full steam over a 10yearperiod it will cost over 25 trillion That is hugehugeIn an earlier colloquy I heard the chairman of the FinanceCommitteewho does such a good job as chairmanmake the point Wellit is fully paid for It is fully paid for in each 10year period Thatis true literally I give him credit for that But two questions areraised by that fact The first is this Why would you expand theFederal Government by 25 trillion when we cant afford the governmentwe haveThe resources that are being used to pay for this should they evercome to fruition are resources which should probably be used to makeMedicare solvent or more solvent or alternatively to reduce our debtand deficit situation as we confront it as a nation We know for afact that every year for the next 10 yearseven before this bill isput in placewe are going to run a 1 trillion deficit every yearbecause that is what President Obama has suggested We know for a factthat our public debt is going to go from 35 percent of our grossnational product up to 80 percent of our gross national product withinthe next 6 years without this bill being passed We know we are in aposition where we are headed down a road which is basically going tohand to our children a nation that is fiscally insolvent because of theamount of debt put on their back by our generation through spending andnot paying for itSo why would we increase the government now by another 25 trillionwhen we cant afford the government we have That is the question Ithink we have to ask ourselves Isnt there a better way to try toaddress the issue of health care reform without this massive expansionof a new entitlementcreating a brandnew entitlement which is going tocost such an extraordinary amount of money and dramatically expandMedicaid which is where most of the spending comes from in this billa massive expansion of Medicaid and a massive new entitlement createdthat we dont have todayThis bill when it is fully implemented will take the size of theFederal Government from about 20 percent of GDP or a little lesswhereit has historically been ever since the postWorld War II periodup toabout 24 or 25 percent of GDP To accomplish that and claim you arenot going to increase the deficit requires a real leap of faithBecause it means that to pay for thisand this is why the MCCainmotion is so importantyou are going to have to reduce Medicarespending by 1 trillion when this bill is fully implemented1trillion over a 10year window In fact during the period from 2010 to2029 Medicare spending will be reduced in this bill by 3 trillionThose dollars will not be used to make Medicare more solvent And weknow we have serious problems with Medicare Those dollars will be usedto create a brandnew entitlement and to dramatically increase the sizeof government for people who do not pay into the hospital insurancefund for people who have not paid Medicare taxes for the most partbut rather for a whole new population of people going under expandedMedicaid and people getting this new entitlement under the public planSo if you are going to reduce Medicare spending in the first 10 yearsby 450 billion and the second 10 years fully implementedthere issome overlap there but fully implemented 1 trillion and then over a19year period the two decades by 3 trillion instead of using thosemoniesthose seniors dollarsto try to make Medicare more solventthey are going to be used for the purposes of expanding and creating anew entitlement and expanding MedicaidThis is hard to accept as either being fair to our senior populationor being good policy from a fiscal standpoint Why is that Because ifwe look at the Medicare situation we know Medicare as it is structuredtoday has an unfunded liability of 55 trillion55 trillion Thatmeans in the Medicare system we do not know how we are going to pay 55trillion worth of benefits we know we are now obligated forThe answer we get from the other side of the aisle is Well this 55trillion number goes down because this bill cuts Medicare andtherefore the benefit structure reduces But do the revenues or thereduction in that go toward the purpose of making Medicare moresolvent No Those monies are taken and spent Those monies are takenand used to create a larger government They arent used to reduce thedeficit or to reduce the debt all of which is being driven in largepart by this 55 trillion worth of unfunded liability as we goforward No they are being used to create a brandnew entitlement whichhas nothing to do with seniors and a brandnew entitlement which isgoing to be paid for in large part by seniors or by a reduction intheir benefit structureThat makes very little sense because essentially you are takingmoney out of the Medicare system and using it to expand the governmentwhen in fact what we should be doing if you are going to take moneyout of the Medicare system is you should be using it to reduce theobligations of the governmentthe debt obligationso the Medicaresystem becomes more affordable That is not the goal here howeverThen of course there is the practical aspect of this We know thesetypes of proposals are plug numbers to a great degree because we knowthis Congress is not going to stand up to a 12 trillion cut inMedicare over the next 10 years and a 3 trillion cut in Medicare overthe next 20 years Why do we know that I know it from personalexperience I was chairman of the Budget Committee the last time wetried to address the fact that we have an outyear liability in Medicarethat is not affordablethis 55 trillion number We know it is notaffordable We know we have to do something about it So I suggestedwhen I was chairman of the Budget Committee that we reduce Medicarespending or its rate of growthnot actual spending its rate ofgrowthby 10 billion over a 5year period less than 1 percent ofMedicare spending My suggestion was that we do that by requiringprimarily we get most of that money by requiring senior citizens whoare wealthy to pay a reasonable proportion of their Part D premium andthen take those moneys and basically try to make Medicare a little moresolvent with it We got no votes from the other side of the aislenone zeroon that proposalNow they come forward with a representation that they are going toreduce Medicare spending and benefits to seniors by 3 trillion overthe next 20 years and 400someodd billion over the next 10 years andthey expect this to be taken seriously Of course not This is allgoing to end up being unpaidfor expenditures in expansion of theseprogramsThese brandnew entitlements that are being put in this bill and thisexpansion of other entitlements that do not deal with Medicare by theway are going to end up being in large part paid for by creating moredebt and passing it on to our children As I mentioned earlier that isa fairly big problem for our kids They are going to get a country asit is today that has about 70 trillion in unfunded liability just inthe Medicare and Medicaid accounts to say nothing of the otherdeficits we are running up around here Now we are going to throwanother huge amount on their backsSome percentage of this 25 trillionprobably a majority of itwill end up being added to the deficit and debt as we move out into theoutyears even though it is represented that it is not going to be Theonly way you can claim you are going to pay for this of course iswith these Medicare cuts andthese tax increases that are in this bill and these fee increases Weare going to spend a little time on the tax increases and fee increasesand the speciousness of those proposals but right now we are focusingon MedicareIn any event what we have is a bill that takes government andexplodes its size We already have a government that is pretty big20percent of our economy You are exploding it to 24 percent of oureconomy and then you are saying you are going to pay for that bydramatically reducing Medicare spending It does not make anyphilosophical sense and it certainly does not pass the test of whathappens around here politicallyIn addition there is the issue of how this bill got to a score inthe first 10 years that made it look as if it was more fiscallyresponsible I have heard people from the other side Again I respectthe chairman of the Finance Committee for acknowledging that this billwhen fully implemented is a 25 trillion bill But a lot of folks areclaiming this is just an 843 billion bill that is all it is in thefirst 10 years that is all it costs There are so many major budgetgimmicks in this bill that accomplish that score that Bernie Madoffwould be embarrassedembarrassed by what this bill does in the area ofgamesmanshipLets start with the fact that it begins most of the fees most ofthe taxes and most of the Medicare cuts in the first year of the 10years but it does not begin the spending on the new program the newentitlements until the fourth and fifth year So they are matching 4and 5 years of spending against 10 years of income and Medicare cutsand claiming that therefore there is a balanceIronically it is represented and rumoredand I admit this is arumorthat originally they were going to start the spending in thethird year under this bill Of course nobody knew what the bill wasbecause it was written in private and nobody got to see it But thenthey got a score from CBO that said it didnt work that way so theysimply moved the spending back a year and started it in the fourthyear They sent it back to CBO and CBO said If you take a year ofspending out in the 10 years and you still have the 10 years of incomefrom the taxes fees and cuts in Medicare you get a better score Wewill give you a better score You will get closer to balance It is apretty outrageous little game of hide the pea under the shellThis is probably the single biggestin my experience and I havebeen on the Budget Committee for quite a whilein my experience it isthe single biggest gaming of the budget system I have ever seen aroundhere But it is not the only one there is something here called theCLASS Act  I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Utah forpurposes of a question  It is about 16 to 17 percent of our gross nationalproduct   It takes the spending from 16 to 17 percent to about 20percent of GDP  The Senator from Utah of course being a senior member ofthe Finance Committee is very familiar with those numbers and that isabsolutely correct  I think that is the biggest in the context of what itgenerates in the way of Pyrrhic nonexistent savings because itbasically says we are really not spendingbecause it doesnt fullyimplement the plan in the first year it says we are not spending thatmuch money In fact we know that when the plan is fully implementedit is a 245 trillion not a 840 billion bill   If I can first answer the question of the Senator fromUtah and then I will be happy to answer the chairman of the FinanceCommitteeThe Senator from Utah basically is correct in his assumptionEssentially they are claiming an approximately 400someodd billionsavings in Medicare over 10 years which they are then using to financethe spending in this bill over the last 5 years 5 to 6 years of the10year window In the end after you fully implement this bill and youfully implement the Medicare cuts it represents 3 trillion ofMedicare reductions over a 20year periodWhere does it come from It comes from two different accountsprimarily One is just about anybody who is on Medicare Advantagetodayabout 25 percent of those people will probably completely losetheir Medicare Advantage insurance and it is 12000 people in NewHampshire so say 4000 people   About 25 percent of those people will lose their Medicareinsurance under this proposal mostly in rural areas And secondbecause there is 160 billion of savings scored You cant save thattype of money in Medicare Advantage unless people dont get theMedicare Advantage advantageSecond it comes in significant reductions in provider payments Howdo provider payments get paid for when they are cut I ask the Senatorfrom Utah I suspect it is because less health care is provided  It certainly affects the hospitals and it probablyaffects the doctors I have heard the Senator from Montana say they aregoing to straighten out the doctor problem down the road but that isanother 250 billion of spending which we dont know where they aregoing to get the money from But yes it would affect in my opinionall providersdoctors hospitals and other people who provide healthcare to seniors You cannot take 450 billion out of the Medicaresystem and not affect peoples Medicare  The Medicaresystem is headed toward insolvency and it goes cashnegative in 2013I believemaybe it is 2012in the sense that it is paying out lessthan it takes in and it has an unfunded liability that exceedsactually 38 trillion now I think it is up around  I think the Senator from Utah has asked one of the corequestions about this bill Why would you use Medicare savingsreductions in Medicare benefits which will definitely affectrecipients for the purposes of creating a new program rather than forthe purposes of making health care more solvent if you are going to dothat in the first place And are these savings ever going to reallycome about One wonders about that also  Actually I would yield to the Senator from Utah on thatissuenot the floor but yield on that question because I think theSenator from Utah was there when Medicare Advantage was drafted as alaw  I believe it is a legal part of Medicare MedicareAdvantage  And this would have a massively disruptive effect onpeople who get Medicare Advantage because you are going to reduce itthe scoring is there will be a reduction in Medicare Advantage paymentsof approximately 162 billion I believe it is and there is no way youare going to keep getting the advantages of Medicare Advantage if youhave that type of reduction in payments  If the Senator will allow me to respond the problem hereis we have rolled the Medicare issue into this major health reformbillor the other side hasand they have used Medicare as a piggybank for the purposes of trying to create a brandnew entitlement whichhas nothing to do with senior citizens Yes Medicare needs to beaddressed It needs to be reformed The benefit structure probably hasto be reformed But we should not use those dollars for the purposes ofexpanding the government with a brandnew entitlement We should usethose dollars to shore up Medicare so we dont have this massiveinsolvency
S_UT_HATCH,2009-12-02,  Will the Senator yield  What is the current cost of our health care across theboard in this country without this bill 5 trillion  The Senator is saying they are going to add if youextrapolate it out over another 10 years 25 trillion  If I understand my colleague correctly he is saying toreach this outlandish figure of 843 billion literally they do notimplement the program until 2014 and even beyond that to a degree butthey do implement the tax increases  Is that one of the budget gimmicks my colleague is talkingabout  You mean they are not using this 500 billion to shore upMedicare and to help it during this period of possible insolvency witha 38 trillion unfunded liability They are not using it for thatpurpose  Am I correct that the Democrats have saidand they seemto be unified on this billthat literally this bill is budget neutralBut as I understand it in order to get to the budget neutrality theyare socking it to a program that has about 38 trillion in unfundedliabilities called Medicareto the tune of almost 500 billion or 12 trillion in order to pay for this Am I correct on that No 2 whois going to lose out when they start taking 500 billion out ofMedicare And what are they going to do with that 500 billion Arethey going to put it into something else Are they using this just as abudgetary gimmick What is happening here As the ranking member on theBudget Committee today you really could help all of us understand thisbetter  How many people on Medicare are on Medicare Advantage  That will be what percentage of people on Medicare  How does that affect the doctors  Am I wrong in saying Medicare is already headed towardinsolvency and that it has up to almost 38 trillion in unfundedliability over the years for our young people to have to pay for  Then how can our friends on the other side take 12trillion out of Medicare which is headed toward insolvency to use forsome programs they want to now institute anew  I heard someone say today on the floorI dont know whoit was I cant rememberthat Medicare Advantage really isnt part ofMedicare Is that true  I was there in the Medicare modernization conferencealong with the distinguished chairman of the committee Senator Baucusand others when we did that because we were not getting health care torural America The MedicareChoice plan didnt work Doctors would nottake patients Hospitals could not pay they could not take patientsThere were all kinds of difficulties in rural America So we didMedicare Advantage and all of a sudden we were able to take care ofthose people Yes it costs a little more but that is because we wentinto the rural areas to do itBut this would basically decimate Medicare Advantage wouldnt itwhat is being proposed here And that is part of Medicare   How can they take 12 trillion out of Medicare That isnot all Medicare Advantage Medicare Advantage is only part of thatthe deductions they will make there But how can they do that and stillrun Medicare in a solvent constructive decent and honorable fashion  For what purpose are they using it  There is no questionhe is a great Senator I have always enjoyed working with him and wehave done an awful lot together I want to compliment SenatorWhitehouse too a terrific human being and great addition to thisSenate and I have a lot of respect for him He gives me heartburn fromtime to time as does Senator Dodd On the other hand they are greatpeople and very sincere Our chairman of the committee Max Baucus isa wonderful man He is trying to do the best he can under thecircumstances I applaud him for it Senator Stabenow from Michigan andI have not seen eye to eye on a lot of things but we always enjoybeing around each otherThis is a great place there is no question about it We have greatpeople here But that doesnt make us any less unhappy about what weconsider to be an awful billBut right now today let me talk about a few specific things Todaythe senior Senator from Illinois came to the floor and spoke about myefforts to reduce the costs associated with medical malpracticeliability I dont think his statement should go unanswered Not onlywere a number of his statements simply incorrect as factual mattersbut some of them even bordered on being offensive I am not offended Ican live with it I can take criticism but some of them I think were alittle bit over the topFirst of all he referred to the recent letter I received from theCBO which indicated that the government would realize significantsavings by enacting some simple tort reform measures I dont knowanybody in America who has any brains who doesnt realize we have to dosomething about tort reform when it comes to health care According tothe CBO these measures would reduce the deficit by 54 billion over 10years That is a lot of money Private sector savings would be evenmore significant According to the CBO we would likely see a reductionof roughly 125 billion in private health care spending over the same10year period and that in my view is a low estimate Democratsapparently want the American people to think these numbers are soinsignificant that this issue should be ignored in this health carebill and I have to respectfully disagreeI may be one of the few Senators in this body who actually triedmedical malpractice cases I actually defended them I defendeddoctors hospitals nurses health care practitioners I understandthemThere are cases where there should be huge recoveries I would be thefirst to admit it I saw the wrong eye taken out the wrong leg takenoff the wrong kidney You only have two of each of those You bet yourbottom dollar we settled those for significant amounts of money But Ialso saw that the vast majority of the cases were frivolousbrought to get the defense costs which then only ranged from 50000 to200000 depending on the jurisdiction If a lawyer can get a numberof those cases they can make a pretty good living by bringing thosecases just to get the defense costs which of course adds to all thecosts of health care There is no use kidding about itFurthermore Senator Durbin the distinguished Senator from Illinoiscited the same CBO letter in order to claim that the tort reformmeasures supported by many on my side of the aisle would cause morepeople to dieGive me a breakI can only assume he is referring to the one paragraph in the CBOletter that addresses the effect of tort reform on health outcomes Inthat single paragraph the CBO referred to three studies One of thesestudies indicated that a reduction in malpractice lawsuits would leadto an increase in mortality ratesone of the threeThe other two studies cited by the CBO found that there would be noeffects on health outcomes and no negative effects could be expectedSo lets be clear the CBO did not reach a conclusion in this caseThese studies were cited only to show that there is disagreement inthis area and once again the majority of the studies cited said therewould be no negative effects on health outcomes Apparently omittingdata and studies that disagree with your conclusions is becoming commonpractice among policy makers these daysIn his speech earlier today the distinguished Senator from Illinoisalso discounted the prominence of defensive medicine in our health caresystem saying only that some doctors perform unnecessary andinappropriate procedures in order to avoid lawsuits Once again thefacts would contradict this generalization A number of studiesdemonstrate this For example a 2005 study of 800 Pennsylvaniaphysicianswhere I used to practice lawin highrisk specialtiesfound that 93 percent of these physicians had practiced some form ofdefensive medicine That was published in the Journal of the AmericanMedical Association June 1 2005In addition a 2002 nationwide survey of 300 physiciansthis is theHarris Interactive Fear of Litigation Studyfound that 79 percentof physicians ordered more tests than are necessary Think about thatIf 79 percent are ordering more tests than are necessary you canimagine the multibillions of dollars in unnecessary defensive medicinethat comes from that But that is not the end of that Fear ofLitigation Study Seventyfour percent of physicians referredpatients to specialists who in their judgment did not need any suchreferral Think about itreferring people to specialists that theyknew they didnt need Think of the cost the billions of dollars incost Fiftytwo percent of physicians suggested unnecessary invasiveprocedures The word invasive is an important word Fiftytwopercent Why Because they are trying to protect themselves by makingsure that everything could possibly be done Fortyone percent ofphysicians prescribed unnecessary medications This is a nationwidesurvey of 300 physiciansThe costs associated with defensive medicine are realI would sayunnecessary defensive medicine because I believe there are somedefensive medicine approaches that we would want the doctors to do butnot to the extent of these doctors ordering more tests than arenecessary ordering more specialists than are necessary suggestingunnecessary invasive procedures unnecessary medications This is themedical profession itself that admits thisIn another study Pricewaterhouse found that defensive medicineaccounts for approximately 210 billion every year or 10 percent of thetotal US health care cost Here are some more facts from thePricewaterhouse study Of the 22 trillion spent every year on healthcare in the United States as much as 12 trillion can be attributedto wasteful spending12 trillion of 22 trillion Yet theDemocrats want to deny that unnecessary defensive medicine is beingutilized to a significant extent According to this study defensivemedicine is the largest single area of waste in the health care systemIt is on par with inefficient claim processing and care spent onpreventable conditionsYet despite these overwhelming numbersand I know some Democratswill say that is Pricewaterhouse and they must have been doing it atthe expense of somebody who had an interest Pricewaterhouse and otheraccounting firms generally try to get it right They got it right hereThose of us who were in that business can attest to itYet despite these overwhelming numbers my friends on the other sidehave opted to overlook them and instead relate horrific storiesassociated with doctors malpractice apparently trying to imply thatRepublicans simply dont care about these truly tragic occurrencesHowever nothing could be further from the truth In fact in all theproposals that have been offered during this debate there has not beena single suggestion to prevent plaintiffs from obtaining thecompensation for actual losses they have incurred not one suggestionthat they should Instead we have sought to impose some limits on thenoneconomic damages All economic damages damages awarded for actualloss past present and futureare fine fair game Weve sought onlyimpose some limits on the noneconomic damages in order to define theplaying field encourage settlement and introduce some level ofpredictability to the systemIt is no secret that personal injury lawyerssome of themareprolific political contributors to those politicians who fight againsttort reform With a Democratic majority and a Democrat in the WhiteHouse their lobbying efforts during this Congress have reachedunprecedented levels Given this reality it is obvious why triallawyers have not been asked to give up anything in the current healthcare legislationSupporters of this health care bill will be asking the Americanpeople to pay higher health care premiums for seniors to give upMedicare Advantage which 25 percent of them have enlisted in forbusinesses to pay higher taxes for medical device manufacturers to paymore just to bring a device to the market that may save lives or makelives more worth living The only group that has not been asked tosacrifice or change the way they do business happens to be the medicalliability personal injury lawyersI would hope we would focus our efforts more on helping the Americanpeople than on preserving a fundraising stream for politicians Sadlythat doesnt appear to be happening in the current debateAs I said there are some very honest and decent attorneys out therewho bring cases that are legitimate where there should be high rewardsBut the vast majority I can personally testify are less thanlegitimate and the resulting costs are costing every American citizenan arm and a leg It is something we ought to resolve We ought toresolve it in a way that takes care of those who truly have injuriesand get rid of these frivolous cases driving up the cost for everyAmericanNot too long ago I talked to one of the leading heart specialists inWashington He acknowledged we all order a lot of tests and so forththat we dont need that we know we dont need But we do it so thatthe history we have of the patient shows we did everything possible torule out everything that possibly could occur even though we know wedont need to do it To be honest under the current system oflawsuits I dont blame them They are trying to protect themselvesWe should also discuss the shortage of doctors we have going intohighrisk specialties We have areas in this country where you cantget obstetricians and gynecologists to the people Law schools willtell you at least the ones I know that there arent that many youngpeople going into obstetrics and gynecology today because they may notmake as much money and the high cost of medical liability insurance isso high that they really cant afford to do it And of course theydont want to get suedSo much for that I love my distinguished friend from Illinois andhe knows it I care for him But let me tell you I think he knowsbetter He knows that I know better I would be the first to come tobat for somebody who was truly injured because of the negligence of aphysician I dont have any problem with that at allI just thought I would make a few comments about this but again saythat I understand some of the excesses that go on on the floor Butthat was an excess this morning even though I know my dear friend issincere and dedicated and one of the better lawyers in this bodyHaving said that I will end on that particular subjectLet me once again take a few minutes to talk about the Medicareprovisions in this Democratic Party health care billThroughout the health care debate we have heard the President pledgenot to mess with Medicare Unfortunately that is not the case withthe bill before the Senate To be clear the Reid bill reduces Medicareby 465 billion to fund a new government program Unfortunatelyseniors and the disabled in the United States are the ones who sufferthe consequences as a result of these reductions Everyone knowsMedicare is extremely important to 43 million seniors and disabledAmericans covered by the Medicare ProgramThroughout my Senate service I have fought to preserve and protectMedicare for both beneficiaries and providers Medicare is already introuble today The program faces tremendous challenges in the very nearfuture The Medicare trust fund will be insolvent by 2017 and theprogram has more than 37 trillion in unfunded liabilities This isgoing to be saddled onto our children and grandchildrenThe Reid bill will make the situation much worse Why is that thecase Again the Reid bill cuts Medicare to fund the creation of a newgovernment entitlement program More specifically the Reid bill willcut nearly 135 billion from hospitalswhere are they going to getthis money120 billion from Medicare Advantage almost 15 billionfrom nursing homes more than 40 billion from home health careagencies and close to 8 billion from hospice providers These cutswill threaten beneficiary access to care as Medicare providers find itmore and more challenging to provide health services to Medicarepatients Many doctors are not taking Medicare patients now because oflow reimbursement ratesLet me stress to my colleagues that cutting Medicare to pay for a newgovernment entitlement program is irresponsible Any reductions toMedicare should be used to preserve the program not to create a newgovernment bureaucracyAs I just said the President has consistently pledged We are notgoing to mess with Medicare Once again this is another example of astraightforward pledge that has been broken over the last 11 monthsMaybe you cannot blame the President because he is not sitting in thisbody The body is breaking itThis bill strips more than 120 billion out of the Medicare AdvantageProgram that currently covers 106 million seniors or almost one out offour seniors in the Medicare Program According to the CongressionalBudget Office under this bill the value of the socalled additionalbenefits such as vision care and dental care will decline from 135to 42 by 2019 That is a reduction of more than 70 percent inbenefits You heard me right 70 percentDuring the Finance Committees consideration of health care reform Ioffered an amendment to protect these benefits for our seniors many ofwhom are lowincome Americans and reside in rural States and ruralareas However the majority party would not support this importantamendment The majority chose to skirt the Presidents pledge about noreduction in Medicare benefits for our seniors by characterizing thebenefits being lostvision care dental care and reduced hospitaldeductiblesas extra benefitsLet me make the point as clearly as I can When we promise Americanseniors we will not reduce their benefits lets be honest about thatpromise So we are either going to protect benefits or not It is thatsimple Under this bill if you are a senior who enjoys MedicareAdvantage the unfortunate answer is no they are not going to protectyour benefitsAll day today we had Members on the other side of the aisle claimthat Medicare Advantage is not part of Medicare This is absolutelyIhave to tell you it is absolutely unbelievable I would invite everyMember making this claim to turn to page 50 of the 2010 Medicare andYou Handbook It saysA Medicare Advantage is another health coverage choice youmay haveGet these wordsas part of MedicareLet me repeat thatA Medicare Advantage is another health coverage choice youmay have as part of MedicareHey that is the Medicare 2010 Medicare and You Handbook Who iskidding whom about it not being part of MedicareSo the bottom line is simple If you are cutting Medicare Advantagebenefits you are cutting MedicareI also heard the distinguished Senator from Connecticut this morningmention that the bureaucratcontrolled Medicare Commission will not cutbenefits in Part A and Part B Well once again my friends on theother side are only telling you half the story So much fortransparency On page 1005 of this bill it states in plain EnglishInclude recommendations to reduce Medicare payments under Cand DI am just waiting for Members on the other side of the aisle to comedown and now claim that Part D is also not a part of Medicare We allknow it isIt is also important to note that the Director of the nonpartisanCongressional Budget Office has told us in clear terms that thisunfettered authority given to the Medicare Commission would result inhigher premiumsIt is important details such as these that the majority does not wantus to discuss and debate in full view of the American people They callit slowwalking They call it obstructionism Making sure we takeenough time to discuss a 2074page bill that will affect everyAmerican life and every American business is the sacred duty of everySenator in this Chamber We will take as long as it takes to fullydiscuss this bill and you can talk for a month about various parts ofthis bill that are outrageous and some that are really good too inall fairnessnot many howeverI have heard several Members from the other side of the aislecharacterize the Medicare Advantage Program as a giveaway to theinsurance industry You know when you cannot win an argument youstart blaming somebody else So they want a government insurancecompany to take the place of the insurance industry Well maybe thatis too much They want it to compete with the insurance industry Buthow do you compete with a governmentsponsored entity And there arecomments that the socalled government plan will cost more than thecurrent insurance businesses they are so criticizing I am not happywith the insurance industry either but by gosh lets be fairLet me give everyone watching at home a little history lesson on thecreation of Medicare Advantage I served as a member of the HouseSenate conference committee which wrote the Medicare Modernization Actof 2003 The distinguished Senator from Montana would agree with me itwas months of hard slogging work every day to try to come up with theMedicare Modernization Act of 2003 Among other things this lawcreated the Medicare Advantage Program It gives people vision caredental care et ceteraWhen conference committee members were negotiating the conferencereport back then in 2003 several of us insisted that the MedicareAdvantage Program was necessary in order to provide health carecoverage choices to Medicare beneficiaries At that time there weremany parts of the country where Medicare beneficiaries did not haveadequate choices in coverage In fact the only choice offered to themwas traditional feeforservice Medicare a onesizefitsallgovernmentrun health programBy creating the Medicare Advantage Program we were providingbeneficiaries with choice in coverage and then empowering them to maketheir own health care decisions as opposed to the Federal Governmentmaking them for them Today every Medicare beneficiary may choose fromseveral health plansWe learned our lessons from MedicareChoice which was in effect atthe time and its predecessors These plans collapsed especially inrural areas because Washington decidedagain government got involvedto set artificially low payment ratesIn fact in my home State of Utah all of the MedicareChoice planseventually ceased operations because they were all operating in thered You cannot continue to do that It was really stupid what we wereexpecting them to do I fear history could repeat itself if we are notcarefulDuring the Medicare Modernization Act conference we fixed theproblem We increased reimbursement rates so all Medicarebeneficiaries regardless of where they livedbe it Fillmore UT orNew York Cityhad choice in coverage Again we did not wantbeneficiaries stuck with a onesizefitsall Washingtonrun governmentplanThere were both Democrats and Republicans on that committee by theway and the leader was of course the distinguished Senator fromMontana I admire him for the way he led it and I admire him fortrying to present what I think is the most untenable case here on thefloor during this debate He is a loyal Democrat He is doing the besthe can and he deserves a lot of credit for sitting through all thosemeetings and all of that markup and everything else and sitting dayinand dayout on the floor hereToday Medicare Advantage works Every Medicare beneficiary hasaccess to a Medicare Advantage plan if they so choose and close to 90percent of Medicare beneficiaries participating in the program aresatisfied with their health coverage But that can all change shouldthis health care reform legislation currently being considered becomelawIn States such as Utah Idaho Colorado New Mexicojust to mentionsome Western StatesWyoming Montanayou can name every StateruralAmerica was not well served and we did Medicare AdvantageChoice in coverage has made a difference in the lives of more than 10million Americans nationwidealmost 11 million Americans The socalled extra benefits I mentioned earlier are being portrayed asgym memberships as opposed to lower premiums copayments anddeductiblesTo be clear the Silver Sneakers Program is one that has made adifference in the lives of many seniors because it encourages them toget out of their homes and remain active It is prevention at its bestIt has been helpful to those with serious weight issues and it hasbeen invaluable to women suffering from osteoporosis and jointproblems In fact I have received several hundred letters telling mehow much Medicare Advantage beneficiaries appreciate this program Theybenefit from it Their lives are better They use health care lessThey do not milk the system They basically have a better chance ofliving and living in greater healthThroughout these debates throughout these markups throughout thesehearings that have led us to this point every health care bill I knowof has a prevention and wellness section in the bill that willencourage things such as the Silver Sneakers Program that has benefitedsenior citizens so much and was not one of the major costs of MedicareAdvantageAdditionally these beneficiaries receive other services such ascoordinated chronic care management which is important coordinatedchronic care management for seniors dental coveragereally importantfor lowincome seniors vision carecan you imagine how important thatis to people over 60 years of age How about those who are over 70 or80 years of age And hearing aidscan you imagine how important thatis to our senior citizens This program helps these seniors and ithelps them the right wayLet me read some letters from my constituents These are real livesbeing affected by the cuts contemplated in the billRemember there is almost 500 billion cut by this bill fromMedicare which goes insolvent by 2017 and has an almost 38 trillionunfunded liabilityLet me read this letter from a constituent from Layton UTI recently received my healthcare updater for 2010 I am ina Med Advantage plan with Blue CrossBlue Shield Thanks tothe cuts in this program by Medicare my monthly premiumshave risen by 49 and my office visit copay has increased150 Senator Hatch I am on a fixed income and this hasreally presented a problem for me and many others I know onthe same program And at my age I certainly cant find a jobthat would help cover the gap I worked all my life to enjoymy retirement and thanks to the current economy Ive lost alot of those monies that were intended to help supplement myincomeThis letter is from a constituent from Logan UT where the greatUtah State University isPlease stop the erosion of Medicare Advantage for seniorsVery many of us are already denied proper medical and dentalcare not to mention those who cannot afford neededmedications Hardest hit are ones on Social Security who arejust over the limit for extra help but cannot keep up withthe rising medical costs that go way beyond the socalledcost of living increases which we are not getting thisyear anyway If those in government who make these decisionshad to live as we do day to day I think we would find betterconditions for seniors The difference in decision makingchanges when you are hungry and cold your own selfHere is a constituent from Pleasant Grove UTPlease do not phase out the Medicare Advantage programsenior citizens need it Our supplement insurance rates go upevery year and our income does not keep pace with the cost oflivingHere is a constituent from Salt Lake City UTWe met with our insurance agent this morning about theincreased costs of our Medicare Advantage plans due to thehealth care reform bill now before CongressOur premium costs have already been significantly increasedwith the coverage substantially decreased We are in our 80sand cannot afford these increases and are hurt by thedecreased coverage We are writing to you to have you stopthe cuts and restore the coverage to Medicare Advantageplans This is an issue that is very important and very realto us at this point in our lives Please stop the cuts andrestore coverageI cant support any bill that would jeopardize health care coveragefor Medicare beneficiaries I truly believe if this bill before theSenate becomes law Medicare beneficiaries health care coverage couldbe in serious troubleI have been in the Senate for over 30 years33 to be exact I pridemyself on being bipartisan I have coauthored many bipartisan healthcare bills since I first joined the Senate in 1977 Almost everyone inthis Chamber wants a health care reform bill to be enacted this year Idont know of anybody on either side who would not like to get a healthcare bill enactedOn our side we would like to do it in a bipartisan way but thisbill is certainly not bipartisan It hasnt been from the beginning Wewant it to be done right History has shown that to be done right itneeds to be a bipartisan bill that passes the Senate with a minimum of75 to 80 votes We did it in 2003 when we considered the Medicareprescription drug legislation and I believe we can do it again todayif we have the will and if we get rid of the partisanship I doubtthere has ever been a bill of this magnitude affecting so many Americanlives that has passed this Chamber on an almostor maybe in acompletestraight partyline vote The Senate is not the House ofRepresentatives This body has a different constitutional mandate thanthe House We are the deliberative body We are the body that has inthe past and should today be working through these difficult issues tofind clear consensus True bipartisanship is what is neededIn the past the Senate has approved many bipartisan health carebills that have eventually been signed into law I know a lot of themhave been mine along with great colleagues on the other side whodeserve the credit as well The Balanced Budget Act in 1997 includedthe HatchKennedy SCHIP program How about the Ryan White Act I stoodright here on the Senate floor and called it the Ryan White bill Hismother was sitting in the audience at the time How about the OrphanDrug Act When I got here we found that there were only two or threeorphan drugs being developed These are drugs for population groups ofless than 250000 people It is clear that the pharmaceutical companiescould not afford to do the pharmaceutical work to come up withtreatments or cures for orphan conditions So we put some incentives inthere we put some tax benefits in there We did some things that wereunique If I recall it correctly it was about a 14 million billToday we have over 300 orphan drugs some of which have becomeblockbuster drugs along the line They wouldnt have been developed ifithadnt been for that little tiny orphan drug bill That was a majorbill when I was chairman of the Labor and Human Resources CommitteeThey now call it the Health Education Labor and Pensions CommitteeHow about the Americans With Disabilities Act Tom Harkin stoodthere I stood here and we passed that bill through the Senate Itwasnt easy There were people who thought it was too much FederalGovernment too much this too much that But Senator Harkin and Ibelievedas did a lot of Democrats and a lot of Republicans as thefinal vote showedthat we should take care of persons withdisabilities if they would meet certain qualificationsHow about the HatchWaxman Act We passed that Henry Waxman a dearfriend of mine one of the most liberal people in all of the House ofRepresentatives and who is currently the very powerful chairman of theEnergy and Commerce Committee over there we got together put asideour differences and we came up with HatchWaxman which basicallyalmost everybody admits created the modern generic drug industryBy the way most people will admit that bill has saved at least 10billion to consumers and more today by the way every year since 1984I could go on and on but let me just say I have worked hard to tryand bring our sides together so we can in a bipartisan way do what isright for the American peopleLet me just tell my colleagues if the Senate passes this bill in itscurrent form with a razor thin margin of 60 votes this will become onemore example of the arrogance of power being exerted since theDemocrats secured a 60vote majority in the Senate and took over theHouse and the White House There are essentially no checks or balancesfound in Washington today just an arrogance of power with one partyramming through unpopular and devastating proposals such as this oneafter anotherWell let me say there is a better way to handle health care reformFor months I have been pushing for a fiscally responsible and stepbystep proposal that recognizes our current need for spending restraintwhile starting us on a path to sustainable health care reform Thereare several areas of consensus that can form the basis for sustainablefiscally responsible and bipartisan reformThese includeReforming the health insurance market for every American by makingsure no American is denied coverage simply based on a preexistingcondition Some of my colleagues on the other side have tried to blastthe insurance industry saying they are an evil powerful industry Weneed to reform them no question about it and we can do it if we worktogetherProtecting the coverage for almost 85 percent of Americans whoalready have coverage they like by making that coverage moreaffordable This means reducing costs by rewarding quality andcoordinated care giving families more information on the cost andchoices of their coverage and treatment options andI said itearlierdiscouraging frivolous lawsuits that have permeated oursociety and made the lives of a high percentage of our doctorsespecially in those very difficult fields of medicine painful andthose fields not very popular to go into today And of course wecould promote prevention and wellness measuresWe could give States flexibility to design their own uniqueapproaches to health care reform Utah is not New York Colorado is notNew Jersey New York is not Utah and New Jersey is not Colorado EachState has its own demographics and its own needs and its own problemsWhy dont we get the people who know those States best to make healthcare work I know the legislators closer to the people are going to bevery responsive to the people in their respective States I admit someStates might not do very well but most of them would do much betterthan what we will do here with some big albatross of a bill that reallydoes not have bipartisan supportActually in talking about New York what works in New York will mostlikely not work in Colorado let alone Utah As we move forward onhealth care reform it is important to recognize that every State hasits own unique mix of demographics Each State has developed its owninstitutions to address its challenges and each has its own successesWe can have 50 State laboratories determining how to do health care inthis country in accordance with their own demographics and we couldlearn from the States that are successful We could learn from theStates that make mistakes We could learn from the States that crossbreed ideas We could make insurance so that it crosses State linesCan you imagine what that would do to costs We could do it Butthere is no desire to do that today with this partisan billThere is an enormous reservoir of expertise experience and fieldtested reform We should take advantage of that by placing States atthe center of health care reform efforts so they can use approachesthat best reflect their needs and their challengesMy home State of Utah has taken important and aggressive steps towardsustainable health care reform They already have an exchange They aretrying some very innovative things By anybodys measure the State ofUtah has a pretty good health care system Is it perfect No But wecould help it to be with a fraction of the Federal dollars that thisbill is going to cost This bill over 10 years is at least 25trillion and I bet my bottom dollar it will be over 3 trillion Thatis on top of 24 trillion we are already spending half of which theyclaim may be not well spent We know a large percentage of that is notwell spentLike I say my home State of Utah has taken important and aggressivesteps toward sustainable health care reform The current efforts tointroduce the defined contribution health benefits system and implementthe Utah health exchange are laudable accomplishmentsA vast majority of AmericansI believe this to be really trueagreea onesizefitsall Washington government solution is not the rightapproach That is why seniors and everybody else except a very few areup in arms about these bills That is what this bill is bound to forceon us a onesizefitsall Washingtonrun controlled governmentprogram I am not just talking about the government option That is asmall part of the argument today If we pass this bill we will haveWashington governing all of our lives with regard to health care Icant think of a worse thing to do when I look at the mess they havemade with some very good programsUnfortunately the path we are taking in Washington right now is tosimply spend another 25 trillion of taxpayer money to further expandthe role of the Federal Government I just wish the majority would takea step back keep their arrogance of power in check and truly work ona real bipartisan bill that all of us can be proud of They have themedia with them selling this bill as less than 1 trillion Give me abreak Between now and 2014 yes they will charge everybody the taxesthey can get and the costs they can get but the bill isnt implementeduntil 2014 and even some aspects not until 2015 That is the only waywith that budgetary gimmick they could get the costs to allegedly bedown below 900 billion But even the CBOcertainly the Senate BudgetCommitteeacknowledges that if you extrapolateI think my colleagueson the other side acknowledge that if you extrapolate it out over afull 10 years you have at least 25 trillion and in somecircumstances as much as 3 trillionHow can we justify that With the problems we have today a 12trillion national debt going up to 17 trillion if we do things likethis How can we justify it How can we stick our kids and ourgrandkids and our great grandkidsmy wife and I have all three by theway kids grandkids and greatgrandkids How can we stick them withthe cost of this bill This is just one bill I hate to tell you someof the other things that are being put forth in not only this body butthe other How come we do it on bills that are totally partisan billsIf we look at what has happened the HELP Committee the HealthEducation Labor and Pensions Committee came up with a totallypartisan bill Not one Republican was asked to contribute to it Theyjust came up with what they wanted to do It was led by one staff onCapitol Hill It is a very partisan bill Then the House came up withtheir bill Not one Republican tomy knowledge had even been asked to help and it is a tremendouslypartisan billboth of which are tremendously costly tooThen the distinguished Senator from Montana tried to come up with abill that would be bipartisan in the Finance Committee but in the endeven with the Gang of 6and I was in the original Gang of 7 but Icouldnt stay because I knew what the bottom bill was going to be andI knew I couldntI couldnt support it So I voluntarily left notbecause I wanted to cause any problems but because I didnt want tocause any problems I found myself coming out of those meetings anddecrying some of the ideas that were being pushed in those meetings Ijust thought it was the honorable thing to do to absent myself from theGang of 7 It became a Gang of 6 and then the three Republicans finallyconcluded that they couldnt support it eitherBut I will give the distinguished chairman from Montana a great dealof credit because he sat through all of that He worked through all ofit He worked through it in the committee but then it became apartisan exercise in committee by and largeYes there were a couple of amendments accepted My gosh look atthat Then what happened They went to the majority leaders office inthe Senate and they brought the HELP bill and the bill from theFinance Committee and they molded this bill this 2074page bill withthe help of the White House Not one Republican I know of had anythingto do with it although I know my dear friend the distinguishedmajority leader did from time to time talk with at least oneRepublican but only on as far as I could see one or two veryimportant issues in the bill There are literally thousands ofimportant issues in this bill not just one or two There are some thatare more important than others but they are all importantI am not willing to saddle the American people with this costlyoverly expensive bureaucratic nightmare this bill will be I hope mycolleagues on the other side will listen and I hope we can start overon a stepbystep approach that takes in the needs of the respectiveStates that is not a onesizefitsall solution that both Republicansand Democrats can work on which will literally follow the principlesof federalism and get this done in a way that all of us can be proudofI dont have any illusions and thus far it doesnt look like thatwill happen But it should happen That is the way it should be done Iwarn my friends on the other side if they succeed in passing this billwithout bipartisan supportif they get one or two Republicans I dontconsider that bipartisan support You should at least get 75 to 80votes on a bill this large which is onesixth of the American economy17 percent of the American economy You should have to get 75 to 80votes minimally It would even be better if you can get more as we didwith CHIP and other bills On some we have gotten unanimous votesonbills that cost money by the way Republicans have voted for themtoo Republicans will vote for a good bill even if it costs some moneyWe are not about to vote for something costing 25 trillion to 3trillion I dont think the American people are going to stand for itBeware my friends of what you are doing I can tell you right nowthis isnt going to work I want to make that point as clear as I canWith that I yield the floorThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Bennet The Senator from Illinois isrecognized  President I rise and offer my congratulations to theReal Salt Lake soccer team the newly crowned champions of Major LeagueSoccer While Utah has a number of sports teams with proud traditionsboth collegiate and professionalReal Salt Lake has brought to my homeState its first major professional championship since 1971 when theUtah Stars won the ABA title Fans throughout Utah are thrilledReal Salt Lake came to Utah in 2004 and faced difficulties during itsfirst three seasons In just its fourth season however Real Salt Lakemade an improbable run to the Western Conference Finals despite onlysneaking into the playoffs on the last day of the regular season Theyeventually lost that game by a score of 10 but with their firstplayoff appearance and opening their new world class soccerspecificstadium their future was filled with promising signsIn 2009 Real Salt Lake delivered on that promise Once again it wasthe last team to qualify for the playoffs and was the lowest overallseed Despite barely squeaking into the playoffs this team ofoverachievers sure made some noise once they got there They quicklyreeled off a string of consecutive upsets against glitzier opponentswith established stars dispatching topseeded and defending MLSchampion Columbus and then powerhouse Chicago and its star CuauhtemocBlancoOn November 22 the title game in Seattle pitted the littleknownupstarts of Real Salt Lake against the Western Conference championsthe Los Angeles Galaxy and its megastars Landon Donovan and DavidBeckham After 90 minutes of regulation play and 30 minutes ofovertime the game remained tied at 11 In the penalty kick shootoutReal Salt Lake emerged victorious 54 as Donovans potential gametyingspot kick sailed harmlessly over the crossbar Real Salt Lake haddelivered the first championship of its kind in Utah in nearly fourdecadesand it couldnt have come in a more exciting fashion or to amore deserving group of athletesIn the end it wasnt the Galaxy of stars that prevailed it was RealSalt Lake with its philosophy that mirrors the words emblazoned on thesign in its home locker room THE TEAM IS THE STAR That teamworkwas certainly on display in the title tilt against Los Angeles It wasreflected in Real Salt Lake Robbie Findleys breakout 64thminutestrike that knotted the score at 11 and made the teams overtime andpenalty kick heroics possible It was reflected in the play of SaltLake goalkeeper and Cup final MVP Nick Rimando who turned awaypenalties from LAs Jovan Kirovski and Edson Buddle before bestingDonovan Finally RSLs determination to overcome the odds also mirrorsthat of its owner Dave Checketts coach Jason Kreis and generalmanager Garth Lagerweyall of whom turned the team into a championdespite the naysayers who said it couldnt be doneNo Real Salt Lakes roster did not have the leagues biggest starsBut in the words of midfielder Clint Mathis better known as CletusRSL was the better team in every game As much as anything elsethat explains why champion Real Salt Lake is now the brightest light inMSLs firmamentOnce again I congratulate Real Salt Lake on this accomplishmentSenator Bennett and I have introduced a resolution expressing theSenates congratulations for Real Salt Lake and I urge my colleagues tooffer their support
S_KS_BROWNBACK,2009-12-22, Madam President I am glad to join my colleagues intalking about the health care bill If you looked in the New York Timestoday there was a fullpage ad describing the bill I am putting it uphere the same thing that was in the New York Times today It startswith the question I want to receive care from my doctor This on onepage puts the 2600 pages in kind of what you are going to see withthis bill It is convoluted It is difficult It is expensive This iswhat you are going to get This was in the New York Times today Thisis where I sit or this is what is going to happen to me in this overallsystem It is no wonder the American public doesnt want this They arenot excited about this They are not excited about what it is going todo to the budget25 trillion That is about 700 million a day ifyou are counting in millions a day as one way to look at itThere are some interesting things hidden within the bill One of thethings I want to point out is the transfer of wealth from young peopleto old One of the things that has really bugged me about what we havedone in so many of the government systems hereit has been a wealthtransfer from younger people to olderSeveral of my children are students and working parttime jobs andthey are paying payroll taxes They say What is this payroll tax goingto I say Well talk to your grandparents and tell them to say thankyou to you These are funds collected that are going to pay for theirretirement funds They do and the grandparents say thank you But itdoesnt seem to be satisfying to them because they are saying Whyarent I putting this in something I am saving money for me so that Ican have something later on instead of this sort of OK I am payingand they are getting What is going to be there when I get thereThat sort of wealth transfer from young people to old peoplecontinues in this bill Look at this wealth transfer Younger workerswill pay more for health insurance premiums so that older workers canpay less Their cost at age 25 will go up 25 percent for healthinsurance premiums If you are 64 it will go down 20 percent forhealth care This is another one of the wealth transfers that takeplace It isnt right It is taking from the kids It is taking fromthe grandkids It should not be continued It is continued in thisbillYou can look at it another way Subsidies in this bill godisproportionately to older Americans Average subsidies for the 55yearolds are nearly 10 times that of a 25yearold A 25yearold getsa subsidy of 458 a 55yearold gets a subsidy of 4427anotherwealth transfer from younger to olderThen you can look at the claims in this bill that there are going tobe tax cuts for the middle class That is if you are in the luckygroup For every lowtomiddleincome family with a tax cut three lowtomiddleincome families have a tax increase in this bill by thestructure of this bill by this structure this convoluted difficulttonavigate hardtounderstand expensive 25 trillion structureThat is where we stand Likely to pass this body and then go to theHouse of Representatives where there is a major issue that is stillbrewing difficult and must be dealt with and that is the issue ofpublic funding of abortion that is in this billIf you want to cut some of the cost out of this thing why dont youtake some of those expenses out of this That would be one way to cutback some of the expenses But in the House bill they included Stupaklanguage which continued the Hyde tradition and law of the land thatthe government will not pay for abortions other than cases of rapeincest and life of the mother Except now buried in the Senate billin the Reid amendment is the public funding of abortion which wehavent done for yearsYesterday I talked to both Congressman Stupak and Senator NelsonThey both agree that the Stupak language is far superior It doesntpublicly fund abortions whereas what is in this bill now does Youdont need to take my word Here is what others have said The USConference of Catholic Bishops who want a health care bill but areopposed to the public funding of abortion and opposed to abortion sayThe bill is morally unacceptable unless and until itcomplies with longstanding current laws on abortion fundingsuch as the Hyde amendmentWe voted on this floor for the NelsonHatch amendment which is nownot in the billYou dont have to take that You can take Bart Stupak Democrat fromMichigan who voted for the bill in the House He saysIt is now not acceptable A dramatic shift in Federalpolicy that would allow the Federal Government to subsidizeinsurance policies with abortion coverageThe American public doesnt want that either The latest poll ofDecember 22 shows that 72 percent of Americans oppose using any publicmoney in the health care overhaul to pay for abortion including 54percent of Democrats and 74 percent of Independents That is where theyare That is where the public isNational Right to Life which is the gold standard on standing up forlife saysThe Reid managers amendment requires that all enrollees inan abortion covering plan make a separate payment into anaccount that will pay for abortions The bill also containslanguage that is intended to prevent or discourage anyinsurer from explaining what this surcharge is to be usedfor Moreover there is nothing in the language to suggestthat payment of the abortion charge is optional for anyenrolleeThis base bill has another thing in it It takes the individual optout and moves to it a State optout So while lets say Kansas may optout of the abortion funding in the bill they still have to pay theirtaxes that go to another State to pay for abortions there which areequally offensive to my people or other States that dont want to seethis funding take placeIt doesnt address the issue of having preventive services includeabortion There was discussion that we are not going to includepreventive services in it but that is not in the language There wasdiscussion We tried an amendment That is not there It can still bedefined Now it may ultimatelyunwind the entire bill based upon the funding of abortion that is inthe Senate bill It will be up to House Members a number of whom arevery concerned and quite fired up about this particular piece to takethis out I know Congressman Stupak is working to do that wants to seethat done agrees with Senator Nelson that his language is farsuperior actually does that It is supported by the Catholic Bishopsthe National Right to Life and other prolife groups that say the wayto go is the Stupak languageIt is not what is in the Senate bill The Senate bill will actuallyfund abortions Then we go through the specifics as I have in here ofthe various places that it has I met with Senator Nelson about thosespecifics I have addressed a number of those concerns I know hecontinues to work on it but at the end of the day this is one of thosebabies you cannot split You need to have the Stupak language in thisbill I am afraid at the end of the day that is not going to be inthere I know Congressman Stupak is pushing very hard for itsinclusion and I wish him all the bestIf this legislation passes this body it is going to be up to theHouse of Representatives to put in that Stupak language And they cando it It is my hope they will do it I do not think the overall billshould be passed but certainly you should not have this piece offunding in this bill in breaking the longstanding work we have had inthe Hyde agreement in the Hyde languageThank you very much Madam President How much time do we haveremaining on our side Madam President in that concluding minute what Iwould like to briefly speak about is the overall processI think there are people in this body who did not want to includethings such as abortion funding in the bill But when you operate in aclosed process like this these sorts of things end up happeningbecause the people who work on these issues are excluded I certainlywas not consulted I am not saying anyone said Well look we are notgoing to get your vote anyway so we do not need to have it But if youdo not want to have abortion funding in it one should look past thatand say Lets get the people who understand and work on this issueand we agree we should not have it in there that is what PresidentObama said it should not be in thereand lets see what languagepasses by their musterThat was not done Unfortunately that is part of what has happenedin this process I think it is tragic that it has happened that way inthis process I think it is wrong I think it builds a bill that thenpeople are not satisfied with and certainly a process they do notagree with that takes place in this overall billIt is still not too late There is still time to address theseissues now that we have the bill to be able to look at If people ofgood faith on the other side want to get these addressed there areways and we have the language on how to address it It is called theStupak language It has already passed the House of Representatives Itis called the NelsonHatch amendment that was debated here although itwas not passed We can do that It is important that it get doneThis bill is not supported by the American public and particularlythis funding piece that is so offensive to so many Americans We candebate about abortion but the government should not be funding it andthat is agreed to by over 70 percent of the American publicI just ask my colleagues on the other side as you move on forwardwith thisif this bill passes heretake this piece out We know whatlanguage is agreed to and works This piece can be taken out It can betaken out yet And I think the whole bill may unwind if it is not takenoutunwind because of a number of Democrats who voted for the bill onthe House side who want the Stupak language and they do not want theinferior language that was put in on the Senate side that will actuallyallow and start the funding of abortion that we have not done for 30yearsMadam President I thank my colleagues and yield the floor 
S_GA_CHAMBLISS,2009-12-07, Is thereanything in the Bennet amendment that removes the expenditure of almost500 billion from Medicare in the base Reid bill that would require therestoration of those cuts to benefit Medicare versus using it as a fundto pay for the underlying Reid bill  If I understand what the Senator is saying in hisamendment he is requiring the Office of Management and Budget as wellas CMS to certify to Congress basically that the savings that arereferred to in the Bennet amendment as well as in the Senatorsamendment are in fact being used to fund Medicare benefits versusbeing used to fund other benefits outside Medicare until such time asMedicare is fully funded  Would the Senator yield for an additional questionThe language in the Bennet amendment that passed 100 to nothing theother day said basically that Medicare savings should benefit theMedicare Program and Medicare beneficiaries That sounds prettystraightforward pretty simple But let me ask the Senator  Let me address a question to our friend from Wyomingwho is a medical doctor in addition to being an outstanding SenatorWhat we are being asked to believe from the folks on the other sideand what the American people are struggling with and having a hard timebelieving is they are saying that even though they are cuttingMedicare by a total of 450 billionplus over a 10year periodactually the solvency of Medicare is going to be extended They expectthe American people to believe that somehowThe fact is we know from the information we received this springfrom the bipartisan Medicare Commission unless something is doneMedicare is going to become insolvent in the year 2017 pure andsimple What we are doing is not taking the savings they areproposingand we dont agree with them but irrespective of thatirrespective of the savings they are saying are going to be achievedinstead of applying that back we are going to use that to grow thesize of government tie some reimbursement payments to physicians tothe Medicare Program and now we are looking at about a 23percentreduction in payments to physicians as reimbursement under Medicare ifwe dont take some action next year When you put all this togetherthe American people are saying You have to be kidding me How in theworld are you going to extend the life of Medicare by cutting it byalmost 500 billion

the rule is fordebate onlyGeneral Leave I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and toinsert extraneous materials into the RecordMr Speaker this rule provides for consideration of HR 4154 thePermanent Estate Tax Relief for Families Farmers and Small BusinessesAct of 2009 The rule waives all points of order against considerationof the bill except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI andagainst the bill itself The rule provides that the previous questionshall be considered as ordered without intervening motions except 1hour of debate and one motion to recommit with or without instructionsIn the engrossment of HR 4154 the Clerk is directed to add at theend the text of HR 2920 the Statutory PayAsYouGoAct of 2009 aspassed by the HouseMr Speaker this past weekend in honor of the Thanksgiving holidaysNBCs Meet the Press hosted the Reverend Rick Warren in adiscussion on giving and civic duty During the dialogue Rev Warrenstated his belief that it isnt a sin to be rich but it is a sin todie rich While I dont agree with Rev Warren on many issues I ask mycolleagues to now reflect on the meaning of those words The Reverendwas speaking of course of the importance of charity and our moralobligation to improve the condition of our fellow man whenever andwherever we canToday I speak to you with the same sense of dutyduty to our countrythat has allowed me personally to achieve personal wealth and in turnto help othersMr Speaker the bill before us under this rule is a significant taxcut Without this bill the estate tax will return in the year 2011 ata much lower exemption amount an exemption of 1 million instead of anexemption at a rate of 35 million and at a much higher tax rate atax rate of 55 percent rather than a tax rate of 45 percent which wehave under this billWe all know that the occasion of the death of a loved one is a verydifficult time for family and friends The price of love isunfortunately loss and thats a price that we all must pay at somepoint in our lives While no act of government can ease this emotionalpain today we have the opportunity to at least give families who haveachieved great success some surety in their ability to ensure that thenext generation will receive the benefit of their worksAn estate tax distorts a free market less than an income tax Insteadof taxing productive capital it takes taxes from a random heir On arevenueneutral basis I for one would much rather pay taxes afterdying than before dying And however much an income tax may distort themarket an estate tax distorts it less on a revenueneutral basisMr Speaker allow me to be clear Individuals like myself whothrough hard work have been able to start businesses create jobs andas a result have been rewarded with the financial resources to providea high standard of living for our families have a duty to our fellowAmericans to pay our fair share And an estate tax the existence of anestate tax is critical to prevent a permanent aristocracy from arisingin this countryWhen I think of the everyday tax burden for my constituents or forthat matter for my staff and associates as a proportion of theirincome as a result of sales taxes property taxes let alone incometaxes I can think of no credible argument for suggesting that anestate tax is unreasonable I also take comfort in knowing that withthe passage of this bill we are locking in that 99 percent of myconstituents will never pay the estate tax According to The UrbanBrookings Tax Policy Center under this proposal only 25 percentthats 14 of 1 percent of debts would be subject to an estate taxWe ask those who labor to build the roads to also shoulder the costWe ask those who educate our Nations children to also help pay for theschools Shouldnt we ask those who die with wealth to help give back alittle to those around them I say to my colleagues this is fair thisis rightWhen factoring the full costs of being a member of a society itsvery clear that all too often we ask the most of those who have theleast For our country to continue to prosper we cant just rely onthe middle class to support our Nations public safety and welfare andto cushion the success of families who are successful in this countryI can personally tell you as one of those Americans thats in the 25percent I would gladly pay an estate tax to give back to the 9975percent of families who do the heavy lifting in this country every dayand ensure that they never have to pay this tax and that family farmscan be passed down to the next generation and small operating familybusinesses will be subject to no estate taxYes Mr Speaker I agree with Rev Warren that its no sin to berich but I disagree that it is a sin to die rich A lifes work shouldrightly be a benefit to ones heirs and ones causes My belief that afamily farm a family business or simply accumulated wealth should bepassed from one generation to the next is consistent with the fact thatthose who benefited the most from the freedom and security that thiscountry offers should pay their fair share for the benefits and thelandscape that allowed them to reach the level of success that theydidWhat all Americans deserve rich or poor is the knowledge that at atime of great personal pain for families the stress will not beexacerbated by a complex or uncertain tax policy Thats one of themany reasons I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this rule andthe underlying billThroughout our history transfer taxes have been used to fundcritical operations of the Federal Government The modern estate taxwas established by the Revenue Act of 1916 to offset declining importtariff revenues as a result of and to finance the United Statesparticipation in World War I Since World War I the estate tax hascontinued to provide Federal revenues that have financed World War IIand the New Deal and have helped end the Great Depression The estatetax includes importantly an unlimited deduction for charitablegiving In 2006 nearly twothirds of charitable requests came fromestates valued over 10 millionWhat a way for Americans to leave a legacy for the next generationUniversities hospitals and arts organizations have come to rely onthese contributions from our Nations most wealthy One need only toura college campus to see the direct impact of the philanthropy on ourstudents and its effect on our future displayed prominently on plaquesoutside many campus buildings like those at the University of Coloradoin Boulder which I representHR 4154 the Permanent Estate Tax Relief for Families Farmers andSmall Businesses Act does exactly what it says The bill will makepermanent the lowest estate tax rate our Nation has seen in a decademaking the current rate permanent and giving families the ability toplan ahead for an orderly transfer of assets Business owners will beable to plan ahead to ensure that their employees will still have a joband their company will be able to continue to provide for theirfamilies after theyre gone Farmers will be able to keep their land intheir familyI remind my colleagues that the 35 million exemption means that nofamily will pay any estate tax unless the estate is valued at at least35 million It is substantially higher than it has been in thisdecade and without our action today we put families in a situation ofunnecessary financial uncertainty at a time when their head and theirhearts can least afford it Without this bill the estate tax willreturn in the year 2011 at a much lower exemption amount of 1 millionand a much higher tax rate of 55 percentMr Speaker I reserve the balance of my timeMr LINCOLN DIAZBALART of Florida I would like to thank my friendthe gentleman from Colorado Mr Polis for the timeMr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consumeEight years ago Mr Speaker the Republicanled Congress passedlegislation that provided over 13 trillion in tax relief by amongothers gradually increasing the exemption for the estate tax whiledecreasing the tax rate itself As part of that legislation the estatetax also known as the death tax is set to disappear next year Theunderlying bill would undo the repeal of the death tax and insteadbring back the tax extend the estate tax rate of 45 percent andinclude an unindexed exemptionI believe these are excessively high rates of taxation especiallywhen we realize that the tax is imposed at the end of a lifetime ofwork on which taxes were paid throughout the stages in which income wasmade It is wrong I believe to tax individuals who have spent theirentire lives working to provide their families with some financialsecurity and so thats why I oppose the underlying legislationThis double taxation which is really what were talking about todayI believe is destructive to familyowned businesses and farms whichare often torn apart or need to be liquidated entirely just to paythose burdensome taxes at the time of death Americans who work hardand pay taxes all of their lives I dont think should be punished forresponsibly saving with yet another tax when they pass awayWhen the country has doubledigit unemployment the current majorityin Congress is threatening small businesses the engines of economicgrowth and job creation in the Nation with even higher tax burdensSmall businesses are often struggling to survive to meet payroll andavoid layoffs and yet this is another example Mr Speaker of thefact that the majority time and time again is proposing legislationthat hampers the ability of small businesses to thrive and to hire newworkersIts unfortunate that the majority feels that they can continuouslyimpact hit small businesses with tax after tax and expect them tosurviveand thrive and retain their workers Thats not the way the economyworksEven if small business owners do not receive an estate tax bill theystill spend resources on estate tax compliance According to a recentsurvey of small and mediumsized manufacturers those small businessesspend an average of 94000 on fees and estate planning costs inpreparation for an estate tax bill Imagine what a small business MrSpeaker could do with that money They could invest it in theircompany to grow their business They could add more workers Insteadthe majority prefers placing more and more burdens And this is but oneexample the legislation being brought forth to the floor today of themajoritys incessant endeavor to place more and more burdens on theengines of our economic growthSmall businesses are responsible for 60 to 80 percent of all new netjobs that were created in the last decade If the majority continueswith their current policies if they continue on this track of placingmore and more burdens on small business the unemployment rate is goingto continue to riseI think what we should be doing is everything possible to lowerunemployment to spur investment and job growth Thats where we shouldbe headingSo I believe what we should be doing is extending the repeal of thedeath tax And many of us in this Congress especially on this side ofthe aisle we feel very strongly on this issue Short of passing thepermanent repeal which I support at the very least I think we shouldenact legislation that sets a reasonable rate provides an appropriateexemption amount and indexes that amount for inflation We already sawwith the alternative minimum tax what not indexing is capable of doingwhen Congress acts in that manner So unfortunately the bill doesnothing of what I just said a reasonable rate and indexing anexemption amountYet we on our side of the aisle will not be able to have a debate onlegislation on a proposal to do just that to index an exemptionamount and set a reasonable rate indefinitely into the future We wontbe able to do that because the majority again is closing down theprocess shutting down debate They promised to do quite the oppositeas you know Mr SpeakerSo lets contrast what the current majority is doing today with theestate tax rule that we passed when we were in the majority That ruleallowed our distinguished colleague Mr Pomeroy to offer his substituteamendment Today we in the minority will be treated much differentlyWe will not be given the opportunity that we gave the currentmajority and Mr Pomeroy We will not be allowed to debate oursubstitute proposal We will not be afforded a vote on our alternativelegislationThe difference in treatment is not an isolated incident but thestandard operating procedure for this majority They continuously closedown the process They shut out Members from both sides of the aislefrom being able to introduce and have debated their amendments and Ithink it is unfortunateI reserve the balance of my time Speaker let me be clear with what happens if theHouse does not pass this bill The estate tax would go away for 1 yearin the year 2010 and then it would return at 55 percent and adeduction of only 1 million so every estate above 1 million would betaxed at a rate of 55 percent Many families would lose their familybusinesses their family farms if we fail to act and pass this bill topreserve the ability of Americans to pass along their assets to thenext generationIt would also create a very bizarre circumstance in the year 2010where there would be an incentive to die I had a friend with a goodsense of humor who stated that his wealthy family his father hadjoked with him that he planned not to stand near the top of a staircasein the year 2010 if that was the caseMr Speaker the estate tax is paid by very few AmericansHistorically fewer than 2 percent of Americans have paid the estatetax and under this bill it will be even less And only 35 percent ofthose who pay the estate tax pay it on small business assets and only5 percent on farms When looking at specifically familyownedbusinesses the number goes down to onehalf of 1 percentMr Speaker let us talk about the options for wealthy families Theestate tax does two important things First it provides revenue togovernment to provide services in the context in which wealth can growprovides the landscaping in our country that allows entrepreneurs andbusinesses to succeed Programs paid for from this revenue fund oursocial safety net our legal structure our public safety programs andour regulatory framework that allows businesses to prosper It is theprotection of the law that allows those who have gained wealth to beable to keep it and transfer it to the next generationThe second and arguably also more important function of the estatetax is to provide an incentive for charitable giving By supportingcharities and nonprofit organizations of their choice the wealthy cansimultaneously give back to the community directly and protect theassets that they leave to their heirsThe estate tax is an important incentive to leverage the work ofgovernment with the efforts of nonprofits to create broad opportunitiesand assistance throughout society By making the rules of the estatetax stable and permanent we give families the ability to plan fortheir future as well as invest in the future of their communitiesWe know that planned giving is an important part of the fundraisingstrategy for the nonprofits that do the good work that government andindustry cannot and there is no denying the link between the estatetax rate and the amount of planned giving A 2004 Congressional BudgetOffice analysis of charitable giving in the year 2000 indicated thatestate tax not only provided an incentive for charitable giving atdeath but also played a role in philanthropic decisions made duringpeoples lives The same report estimated that the repeal of the estatetax would result in a decrease in bequests of anywhere from 16 to 28percent or 13 billion to 25 billion more than total corporatedonations in a yearI ask my colleagues which universities do you know could take a 16to 28 percent hit to their endowment coupled with the decreases in themarket of the last year and yet continue to prepare our students to becompetitive in the global marketplace This is the realworld impact ofwhat would actually occur were the estate tax to be abolished in theyear 2010 not to mention what would happen when it came back at 55percent and only a 1 million deduction the following yearNow imagine in the worst case scenario devised by opponents of theestate tax Imagine that came true for a family that in order to paythe tax the heirs had to liquidate the assets of a business that hadbeen in the family for some time Do opponents of this bill trulybelieve that somehow making the family pay capital gains tax on theseassets if they had purchased them in 1959 would be better I know in mydistrict due to the growth and economic success Colorado has enjoyedtaxation on real estate assets as an example from a 1959 basis wouldbe devastating It would capture a much larger portion of middle classfamilies Many middle class families and indeed wealthy familiesworth 1 million 2 million 3 million would be stuck with large taxbills forcing liquidation if they were forced to pay capital gains taxon a 1950 basis or a 1959 basisI cant tell my constituents that I am against a permanent reductionin the estate tax and yet support a dramatic increase in capital gainstaxation for them which would bring the estate tax to upper middleclass families I hope the majority of my colleagues agree and willsupport the rule and the underlying billI would like to thank Chairman Rangel the members of the Ways andMeans Committee and their staffs for their efforts in bringing thisbill and the gentleman from North Dakota Mr Pomeroy for introducingthis billI urge my colleagues to consider that 9975 percent of Americans willnever pay this tax and those who do should be thankful that they havehad the opportunity to succeed in this great country and the privilegethe honor of being in a position where they are subject to this taxbecause their estates are worth more than 35 millionI would like to remind my colleagues who stand by the old adage youcant take it with you and I ask my friends and colleagues toconsider the farreaching benefits of charity and a sense of duty tocountry and I ask for the passage of this rule and the underlyinglegislationI reserve the balance of my timeMr LINCOLN DIAZBALART of Florida Mr Speaker I yield 3 minutes tothe gentleman from Georgia Mr Gingrey  I am our final speaker so I reserve the balance of mytime to closeMr LINCOLN DIAZBALART of Florida Mr Speaker I yield 3 minutes tothe gentlewoman from North Carolina Ms Foxx my distinguished friendand colleague from the Rules Committee  Speaker I want to begin by addressing some of themisconceptions and inaccuracies in the arguments that have been made onthe other side of the aisleFirst Id like to address some made by the gentleman from Texas thatthis is a tax on those who have paid the highest tax rates throughouttheir lives Id like to dispute this notion Many of the people whohave accumulated great wealth in this country have throughout theirlives paid the capital gains tax rather than the income tax rate Ifor one and Im I think the fourth or fifthwealthiest Member ofthis bodyIve accumulated some degree of wealth with my success inthe Internet sector starting companies selling them Ive paid thecapital gains tax That is a 15 percent tax not a 396 or a 35 percenttaxIn a moment we will hear some quotes from Mr Buffett Mr Gates andMr Soros three wealthy Americans all supporters of the estate taxThey have also accumulated their wealth and have paid the capital gainsrate In the case of for instance Bill Gates the wealthiestAmerican he has paid a rate substantially below 15 percent due to hischaritable contributions The rate that Mr Gates has paid is probablysomewhere in the 1012 percent tax rangeSo again I have paid less percentage tax than members of my staffhere in Congress that earn 50000 60000 a year They pay a highertax rate So its inaccurate to say that those who are hit with theestate tax have paid the highest tax rate throughout their lives Theremight be some movie stars sports stars highwage earners that havebeen paying the highincome margins highest marginal income tax ratethroughout their lives But the majority of wealth is accumulated onthe capital side and has been subject to the capital gains rate whichhad been 20 percent more recently 15 percent and scheduled to returnto 20 percent regardless well below the highest marginal rateId also like to address a remark made by my colleague from NorthCarolina Dr Foxx She called this the biggest increase ever in theinheritance tax rate Again this is a decrease a decrease in theinheritance tax Yes there is a 1year effect For the year 2010alone its an increase For every other year its a decrease Insteadof 55 percent and 1 million every dollar above 1 million would betaxed at 55 percent if we dont pass this in the year 2011 and beyondWe are reducing thatThis is a substantial decrease one of the largest decreases in theinheritance tax rate to 45 percent from 55 percent in 2011 and beyondAnd were increasing the deduction Were starting that at a 35million estatethats a 7 million estate for a couple that passesaway instead of a 1 million deduction to be clear Id further liketo make it clear that repealing the estate tax and replacing it with acapital gains tax on the increase in basis would be a tax increase asproposed by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle This would bea tax increase for upper middle class families and would actuallyresult in many families losing their family businessesIf you have a 3 million family business family farm under theDemocratic proposal they pay zero tax Under the Republican proposal a3 million family estate or farm with a very low basis they started itmaybe with 100000 in the 1950s so thats a 3 million gain thatwould be subject to 450000 capital gains tax At 20 percent it wouldbe over 600000 in taxes That could result in the family losing thefarm or losing the small business Under the Democratic proposal weallow families to keep family farms and small businesses in the familyMr Speaker this bill is one of many steps that Congress must taketowards an equitable Tax Code The bill highlights Democraticcommitments to fairness by making permanent the current estate taxexemption of 35 million 7 million total at a maximum tax rate of45 percent Opponents of this bill may say the estate tax should berepealed Well thats supporting a debt finance tax cut of 13trillionYes repealing the estate tax in its entirety would result in anincrease in the deficit of 13 trillion Thats 1 trillion in lostrevenue and 277 billion in increased interest payments on our growingnational debt Does that sound like fiscal responsibility The onlyresult of repealing the estate tax would be that the 25 percentquarter of 1 percent of the wealthiest American families will pay asmall estate tax while other Americans wont have to suffer fromincreased debtMr Speaker lets be honest with the American people The estates ofthose 9975 percent of Americans will continue to be tax free As forthose 25 percent that are subject to the tax such as Bill Gatesestate such as my own we understand that the government thatprotects our business activities the traditions that enable us to relyon certain things happening thats what creates capital and enablesnet worth to increaseThose are Bill Gates words not mine But I strongly agree InWarren Buffetts opposition to the repeal of the estate tax he saidthat the repeal of the estate tax would be akin to choosing the 2020Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold medal winners inthe 2000 Olympics because without the estate tax you in effectwill have an aristocracy of wealth which means you pass down theability to command the resources of the nation based on heredity ratherthan meritAmerica is and should be a meritocracy Estate tax helps prevent apermanent aristocracy of the wealthy from arising in this country Someopponents of the estate tax claim that it forces families to hand overhalf of their wealth to the government But the facts simply dontsupport this claim The truth is that few estates pay any estate taxwhatsoever and those that do pay less than 20 percent of the value oftheir estate We also know that the claims of rampant liquidation offarms is completely untrue In fact the American Farm BureauFederation acknowledged to The New York Times that it couldnt find asingle example of a farm to substantiate the claim even when theestate tax was higher 55 percent rather than the 45 percent it istodayId like to give a quote from the president of the National FarmersUnion who says Family farmers and ranchers are insulted by thosewho use farmers as the reason for eliminating estate taxes Id alsolike to give a quote from George Soros George Soros said The estatetax is the least damaging of all our taxation because it does notinterfere with wealth creation It increases social equality It is soobvious estate taxation is a valuable taxation and we should keepitAgain on a revenue neutral basis I would much rather pay 1000 intax after I die than before when Im using that capital to createvalue and jobs or at least I was before I got to CongressMr Speaker our choice here is clear We can pass this bill whichwill remove the impact of the estate tax from 9975 percent ofAmericans and give those who will pay this tax a substantially largerdeductible We can make sure that family businesses and family farmswont be subject to onerous taxation Or we can increase the deficit byover 1 trillion and increase taxes for estates of 2 million 3million 4 million with sizable capital gains within those estatesOnce again I thank Chairman Rangel the members of the Committee onWays and Means and their staffs as well as Representative Pomeroy forbringing this important legislation to the floor In America its nota sin to be rich nor is it a crime to die rich This bill gives ourNations wealthiest families the ability to know exactly what theirobligation to the Nation that fostered their wealth will be And it isfair and it is justMr Speaker Id ask my colleagues to join me on the side of factsequity and the 99 percent of Americans who will never pay this tax andwho wish thatthey were lucky enough to be successful enough to pay this tax andremind them that a no vote is a vote against these principlesI ask my colleagues to vote yes on the Permanent Estate TaxRelief for Families Farmers and Small Businesses Act of 2009 I urgea yes vote on the previous question and I urge a yes vote onthe ruleThe material previously referred to by Mr Lincoln DiazBalart ofFlorida is as followsAmendment

S_OH_BROWN,2009-12-02, President I certainly appreciate Senator Vittersempathy for victims of breast cancer for people who obviously shouldbe tested for breast cancer in many cases more frequently than theyare I am sorry about Wendys mothers death from breast cancerI think though that Senator Vitter missed the larger point Whilemost of us in this Chamber disagree with the finding of that Bushappointed commissioncommittee commission task forceI think thebigger question is that a whole lot of the status quo which SenatorVitter has defended sort of ad hominem the bigger question is underthe status quo so many women arent getting tested for breast cancerIt is estimated that 4000 breast cancer deaths could be prevented justby increasing the percentage of women who receive breast cancerscreeningThat is why the Mikulski amendment is so important It is importantbecause in this country today if you take a group of 1000 women whohave breast cancer and who have insurance and 1000 women who havebreast cancer who dont have insurance those who dont have insuranceare 40 percent more likely to die So the issue is that committeeIthink that commission made a mistake We pretty much most of us herethink that commission made a mistake I am not sure why those peoplewhom President Bush put on the commission made the decision they didIt should have been oncologists sitting Senator Vitter is right aboutthatThe larger point is that women without insurance dont get testedand women without insurance are 40 percent more likely to die of breastcancer than those with insurance At the same time as the PresidingOfficer knows in the State of Maryland women typically pay more fortheir insurance than men do on the averageSo if we are going to do this right it means we need insurancereform which is what this legislation does No more preexistingconditions no more men and women who have their insurance canceledbecause they got too sick last year and had too many expenses and theinsurance companies practiced rescission and they cut them off No moreif I have insurance and if I have a child born with a preexistingcondition do I lose my insuranceI come to the floor pretty much every day reading letters from peoplein Ohiofrom Galion and Girard and Gallipolis and Lima all over myState Typically people were pretty happy with their insurance if theyhad written me a year ago these people But today these people writingfound out their insurance doesnt cover what they thought it did Theyend up losing their insurance because of a preexisting condition Theycant get insurance because they once had breast cancer They have hadthis discrimination against them because of gender or geography ordisability That is what is important about the bill and what isimportant about the Mikulski amendmentThat is why I would hope Senator Vitter as he is pushing forassistance for women with breast cancerI applaud him for thatwouldgo deeper than just dismissing the recommendations of one governmentcommission and that in fact he would advocate for better testingmore frequent testing for women who are not getting tested often enoughtoday and that the rates for women would be comparable to the ratesfor men That is again why the Mikulski amendment is so importantI will repeat The health reform legislation as is will finally putan end to discrimination discrimination that charges womensignificantly higher premiums because they have had childrenIt is considered a preexisting condition by some insurance companiesif a woman had a Csection because she might get pregnant again and sheis going to have another Csection and that costs more A woman with aCsection has a preexisting condition A woman who has beenin somecases with some insurance companies policiesvictimized by domesticviolence has a preexisting condition because the boyfriend the husbandor whoever hit her the one time the insurance companies would suggestis going to do it again So she has a preexisting condition What kindof health care system is thatThat is why I suggest Senator Vitter support the Mikulski amendmentand support this legislation In fact it will put rules on insurancepolicies so people will be treated in a different way than they havebeen in the pastLet me talk for a moment specifically about the Mikulski amendmentand why it is so important It will ensure that women are able toaccess needed preventive care and screenings at no additional cost Oneof the things in spite of the MCCain amendmentand I appreciatedSenator Baucuss comments a minute ago about how ironic it is I was inthe House of Representatives for 14 years and in the Senate now for thelast 3 or so I have heard so many colleagues eviscerate Medicare Theyhave tried to cut Medicare privatize it and come at it from alldifferent directions repeatedly over these last 15 years Now they wantto tell us they are the ones who want to protect Medicare In factthis legislation saves money and saves lives and this legislationsaves MedicareOne of the things this legislation does for Medicare beneficiaries isit will begin to provide these preventive care screenings so seniorswill pay no copay It is not cutting Medicare and services as myfriends on the other side sayall those who are opposed to every partof the bill most of whom have tried to slow this legislation down Wecannot even vote on the MCCain amendment We are ready to do it butthe Republicans dont seem to want to move forward on this legislationLet me go back to why the Mikulski amendment makes so much sense Allhealth care plans would cover comprehensive womens preventive care andscreenings requiring that recommended services be covered at no costto women We know that to get preventive screenings and careif wemake them at no cost the chances of people getting them aresignificantly higher More than half of women delay or avoid preventivecare because of the costs One in five women at age 50 has not receiveda mammogram in the past 2 yearsThat isnt because the Commission appointed by the former PresidentBush made this decision it is not because of their bureaucraticdecision that Senator Vitter rails about and many of us agree with itis not because 1 in 5 women age 50 has not received a mammogram it isthat they dont have insurance in most cases and they cannot affordthe mammogramIn 2009 some 40000 women will lose their lives to breast cancer4000 breast cancer deaths onetenth of those could have beenprevented by increasing these preventive screenings These kinds ofmammograms this preventive care and these doctor visits will becovered for free for womenThis amendment would broaden the comprehensive set of womens healthservices that health insurance companies must cover and pay forFor instance it would ensure that women of all ages are able toreceive annual mammograms covered by their insurer It would encouragecoverage of pregnancy and postpartum depression screenings Pap smearsscreenings for domestic violence and annual womens health screeningsIt makes so much sense It would save the lives of women and it meanswomen would suffer from a lot less illnesses It will save money forthe health care system because these illnesses will be detected muchearlier and women will get the kind of care they should That is whatthis whole legislation is about and what the Mikulski amendment willadd toThis amendment will remove any and all financial barriers topreventive care so we can diagnose diseases and illnesses earlywhenwe have the best chance at being able to save lives obviouslyUnderstand again this legislation and the Mikulski amendment aresupported by the National Organization for Women the NationalPartnership of Women and Families the American Cancer Society CancerAction Network and all kinds of womens organizations They understandthis is the best thing for women in this countryI hope the Senate can proceed to a vote on this amendment I hope myRepublican colleagues will not just talk about the bad decision of thisCommissionand most of us think it was a bad decisionbut actually dosomething about it something substantive and give women in thiscountry a fairer shake from health care insurance companies and coverthese preventive services and cancer screenings It will make a bigdifference if we can move forward and expand preventive health careservices to womenI yield the floorThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Merkley The Senator from Oklahoma isrecognized  I say to Senator Dodd we remember 10 years ago when theinsurance companies came to the government and said we can do somethingthat later became Medicare Advantage and we can do it lessexpensively They said we can do it for 5 percent less than the cost ofMedicare and the government unfortunately made the agreement with themto sign up to do that Then what happened in the last 10 years is theinsurance lobbyists came here and lobbied the Bush administration andlobbied the Congress and got bigger payments It is a subsidy for theinsurance companies but you and Senator Baucus and Senator Durbin saidit is not Medicare it is private insurance privatized form ofMedicare that serves the insurance companies very well is thatcorrect but doesnt serve the seniors in this country
S_OK_COBURN,2009-12-02, President I wish to pick up where Senator Brown leftoff I will describe one of my real patients but I will not use herreal name I will call her Sheila Sheila was 32 years old Shecame in with a breast mass I examined it and thought it was a cyst Isent her to get an ultrasound which confirmed a cyst OK We did amammogram to make sure The mammogram said it looks like a cyst Thestandard of care for somebody with a cyst is to watch it expectantlyunless it is painful because 99 percent of them are benign cysts Ihad the good fortune to do a needle drainage on her cyst 3 days aftershe had her mammogram There were highly malignant cells within thecyst She has since diedThe reason I wanted to tell the story about Sheila is because whatthe Senator from Ohio in supporting the Mikulski amendment doesntrecognize is we dont allow the Preventive Services Task Force to setthe rules and guidelines We do something worse We let the Secretaryof HHS set the guidelinesThe people who ought to be setting the guidelines are not thegovernment they are the professional societies that know theliterature know the standards of care know the best practices andin fact the Mikulski amendment doesnt mandate mammograms for womenIt leaves it to HRSA the Health Resources Services Administrationwhich has no guidelines on it today whatsoeverSo what you are saying with the Mikulski amendment is we want thegovernment to once again decideall of us are rejecting what thePreventive Services Task Force has said but instead we are going toshift and pivot and say we will let the HRSA decide what your careshould beThe other aspect of the Mikulski amendment I fully agree with Idont think there ought to be a copay on any preventive services Iagree 100 percent But the last place we ought to be making decisionsabout care and process and procedure is in a government agency thatNo 1 is going to look at cost as much as at preventive effectivenessIf the truth be known the Preventive Services Task Force from acost standpointas a practicing physician I know how to read whatthey put outfrom a cost standpoint it is exactly right From aclinical standpoint they are exactly wrong because if you happen tobe under 50 and didnt have a screening mammogram and your cancer wasmissed to you they are 100 percent wrong You see the governmentcannot practice medicine effectively What we are trying to do in thisbill throughout is have the government practice medicine whether it isthe comparative effectiveness panel or the Medicare Payment AdvisoryCommissionWhat we have asked is for the government to make decisionsLet me tell you what that is That is the government standing betweenme and my patient It is denying me the ability to use my knowledge mytraining my 25 years of wellearned gray hair and combine that withfamily history social history psychological history where it mightbe important and clinical science and me putting my hand on a patientsuch as I did Sheila Most physicians would never have stuck a needlein that cyst and she would not have lived the 12 years that she livedShe would have lived 1 or 2 years But she got 12 years of life becauseclinical judgment wasnt deferred or denied by a government agencyThere is a wonderful member of the British Parliament who happens tobe a physician When we were debating the issue of the comparativeeffectiveness panel which will be applied to whatever HRSA or theSecretary does I asked him What about the national institute ofcomparative effectiveness in England Here is what he said As aphysician it ruins my relationship with my patient because no longeris my patient 100 percent my concern Now my patient is 80 percent myconcern and the government is 20 percent of my concern So what I do isI take my eye off my patient 20 percent of the time to make sure I amcomplying with what the national institute of comparative effectivenesssayseven if it is not in my patients best interestWhen we pass a bill that is going to subterfuge or undermine theadvocacy of physicians for their patients the wonderful health care wehave in this country will decline There are a lot of other thingsabout the bill I dont agree with But the No 1 thing as a practicingphysician that I disagree with is the very factthe thing I am mostopposed to as a practicing physicianI like best practices I useVanderbilt in my practice I like them They make me more efficient andmake me a better doctor But they are not mandated for me when I seesomething that in my judgment and in the art of medicine I get to gothe other way because I know what is best for my patientWhat we have in this bill is what we passed with the stimulus billthe comparative effectiveness panelwhich is utilized in this billand we have the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission saying you have tocut Where do we cut Whose breast cancer screening do we cut nextyear When we have the Commission saying we have to unless we actaffirmatively in another way we are dividing the loyalty of everyphysician in this country away from their patients They are no longera 100percent advocate for their patients This is a governmentcentered bill It is not a patientcentered billGoing back to the Mikulski amendment and what will come with theMurkowski amendment the Murkowski amendment is far better It doeseverything Mikulski does but doesnt divide the loyalty or advocacy ofthe physician Here is what it does The Murkowski amendment saysnobody steps between you and your doctornobody not an insurancecompany not Medicare or Medicaid We use as a reference theprofessional societies in this country who do know best whether it befor mammograms and the American College of Surgeons the AmericanCollege of OBGYNs the American College of Oncology the AmericanAcademy of Internal Medicine or the American College of Physicianswhich have come to a consensus in terms of what best practices are butdont mandate what will or will not be paid for when in fact the artof medicine is applied to save somebodys life such as SheilasFor you see if this bill passed Sheila would have lived 2 yearsinstead of 12 Ten years was really important to her family She got tosee the children I delivered for her grow up One of them she got tosee marriedIf we decide the government is going to practice medicine which iswhat this bill doesthe government steps between the patient and theircaregiver deciding in Washington what we will dowhat you will haveis good outcomes 80 percent of the time and disasters 20 percent of thetime That is not what we wantI do not deny that there are plenty of problems in my profession interms of not being as good as we should be of not having our eye onthe ball some of the time of making mistakes some of the time I donot deny that But what I do embrace is most people who go into thefield of medicine go in for exactly the right reason that is to helppeople It is so ironic to me that we have a bill before us that limitsand discourages and takes away the most altruistic of all effortswhich is to do 100 percent the best right thing for your patientThe reason having HRSA or the Secretary set guidelines is bad isbecause most patients do not fit the textbook Here is what thetextbook says but this patient has this condition this history andthis finding that are different What we have done in this bill ismultiple times take the learned judgment of caregivers and say Youwill bow to what the Federal Government says you will bow to what HRSAsays you will bow to what the Secretary of HHS says Seventyfivetimes in this bill there are new programs created 6950 times in thisbill are requirements for the Secretary to set up new rules andregulations If you do not think that will put the government betweenyou and your care you have no understanding of health care in thiscountry and you have no understanding of the problems we face todaybecause of Medicare and Medicaid rules that interrupt and limit theability for us to care in the best way for our patientsI am for the prevention aspects of the Mikulski amendment I think itis a great idea As a matter of fact it should not be just aboutwomen It should be about screening for prostate cancer for men aswell It should be about treadmills for people with high cholesterolIt should be about true preventive measures Why were they notincluded Because what we have done under the Mikulski amendment is892 million over 10 years We want to do this for one group but wewill not do it for the otherIf you think the government will not get in between let me givethree examples right now which violate Federal law today The Centerfor Medicare and Medicaid Services today violates Federal law Theyration the following three thingsIf in fact you are elderly and you have a complication with yourcolon and you are a highrisk patient to have a perforation if you wereto have a colonoscopythat is when we go in with a fiber optic lightto look at the colonMedicare denies the ability for you to have a CTautomated cameracentered swallowedpill colonoscopy which isavailable The technology is proven and is being used outside ofMedicare You cannot have a video colonoscopy by way of a remotecontrol camera Why did CMS eliminate that They eliminated it becauseit costs too much So if you are 87 years old and you have a mass inyour colon and you cannot have a regular colonoscopy you cannot evenbuy this procedure it is against the law because Medicare forbids itNo 2and this has happened to me numerous timeswomen with severeosteoporosisa loss of calcium in their bones at 50 years of agediagnosed with a DEXA scan in a screening prevention so they do not geta collapsed vertebra or break a hip you put them on a medicine Themedicines are expensive there is no question but they really do workSome medicines work for some people other medicines work for othersOnce you do a DEXA scan under Medicare rules you cannot do anotherone for 2 years So you cannot check to see if the medicine is workingafter 6 months to see if you see an improvement in the calcificationof a womans bones because Medicare said it is too expensive and weare doing too many of them Rather than go after the fraud in DEXAscans what they did was ration the careHere we have a woman and you have diagnosed her properly You havestarted her on the medicine but you have to wait 2 years What happensduring that period of time if you are given a medicine that is notworking effectively Because it did not work in her case you have towait 2 years and her osteoporosis advances and she falls and breaks herhip because Medicare said we were doing too many of themTake what CMS did to all the oncologists in this country They saidwe are paying too much money for EPOGEN EPOGEN is an acronym forerythropoietin which is a chemical that is kicked out by your kidneysto cause you to make red blood cells When you get chemotherapy forbreast cancer or colon cancer like I have had sometimes thatchemotherapy not only kills your cancer but it kills your blood cellsBecause we were using too much EPOGEN Medicare put out a rulerationing EPOGEN and said Unless you have a hemoglobin of X amountyou cannot get a shot of EPOGEN and by the way you cannot take yourown money and buy it either The doctor will get fined if he gives itto you if you dont meet the guideline What happens For 80 percent ofthe patients it worked fine But for those patients who have othercomorbidother conditions such as congestive heart failure or chronicobstructive pulmonary diseaseemphysemawhere significant drops inhemoglobin can cause organ failures in other parts of the body therewas no exception made by CMS for a physician to make a judgment andsay This rule should not apply here because this patient is going toend up in the hospitalMy oncologist told me a story of one of his patients who could notget EPOGEN It ended up that their heart failure was exacerbatedbecause they got anemic from the chemotherapy ended up on a ventilatorin ICU and died Why did they die Because they got heart failure Whydid they get heart failure Because they got too anemic Why did theyget too anemic Because Medicare would not allow the doctors to givethem the medicineWhat is wrong with the bill what is wrong with the Mikulskiamendment is we rely on government bureaucracies to make the decisionsabout care rather than the trained learned experienced truly caringcaregivers in this country to make those decisions Instead of goingafter the fraud in Medicare which is well in excess of 90 billion ayear we decided we will ration careThe authors of this bill are going to say No that is not true Butwhen I offered amendments in committee to prohibit rationing ofMedicare servicesto prohibit itit was voted down Every person whovoted for moving on this bill voted against the rationing Why wouldthey do that Because ultimately the feeling is We know betterWashington knows better We know your patients better We know how topractice medicine better We are going to take ivory tower doctors whodo not have real practices anymore we are going to take retiredresearchers and we are going to tell you how to practice And we aregoing to save money by limiting what you can getThe chairman of the Finance Committee has said we do not truly cutMedicare Advantage that the services are not reduced The chairmansown bill on page 869 subtitle C part CI wont go through readingitreduces Medicare Advantage payments The differential from 135toI will read it to the chairman The chairman is shaking his headLet me read it to him Let me also reference what CBO has said I willbe happy to yield to the chairman if he wants to talk now    No required reductions in what  President will the Senator yield for a minute  Reserving the right to object I will ask for 2additional minutes for my side  How about 1  The first comment Ihave is about relying on what Wall Street analysts say today They haveabout this much credibility in this country today Look at the economicsituation we find ourselves in because of whatWall Street analysts have said That is the first point I would makeThe second point is that the majority whip yesterday said we shouldcut Medicare Advantage because of the 14 percent Senator Dodd justrecently went after the Patients Choice Act because we actually makeit be competitively bid without any reduction in benefits Your billfor every Medicare Advantage cuts 50 percent of the benefits out Itcuts the benefitsThe difference isand I agree with the majority whipwe do need tohave the savings in Medicare Advantage but the way you get that isthrough competitively bidding it while at the same time maintaining therequirements for the benefits that are offered There is a bigdifference in those two Ours ends up being pure savings to saveMedicare The savings in this bill are to create a new entitlementThe other point I wish to make is if you are a senior out therelistening and if you are going to be subject to the new increase inMedicare tax for the first time in history we are going to take theMedicare tax and not use it for Medicare we are going to use it forsomething else under this bill This onehalf of 1 percent is now goingto be consumed in something outside of Medicare So no longer do wehave a Medicare tax for the Medicare trust fund We have a Medicare taxthat funds the Medicare trust fund plus other programsI say to my colleagues I think we want a lot of the same things Howwe go about itthe Senator from Montana recognized the fact that weare going to increase payments to primary care physicians Ask yourselfthe question why only 1 in 50 doctors last year who graduated frommedical school is going into primary care Why do you think that isCould it be that the government that is setting the payment ratescreated a maldistribution in remuneration to primary care physicianstherefore they choose to go where they can make 200 percent more overtheir lifetime by spending 1 additional year in residency rather thandoing primary careWhat this bill does and what the Senator from Arizona is trying todo by sending this bill back is to refocus it on the fact thatMedicare money ought to be used for Medicare If in fact we are goingto slow the growth of Medicare can we do that without cuttingbenefits To slow the growth in this bill for 11 million Americans whonow have Medicare Advantage will diminish their benefits That is outof the 120 billion that is going to comeYou cannot tell a senior who is in a rural area today who is on theeconomic lower rungs of the ladder who uses Medicare Advantage toequalize their care with somebody who can afford a Medicaresupplemental policy you cannot tell them this is not going to decreasetheir benefits and their care because it is And in the bill itactually states that it is going to decrease their benefits  The Senator would probably be interested to knowand Iknow my colleagues on the other sidethat the American MedicalAssociation now represents less than 10 percent of the activelypracticing physicians in this country The physicians as a whole inthis country are adamantly opposed to this bill The reason they areopposed to this bill is because you are inserting the governmentbetween them and their patient That is why they are opposed to thisbillSo you have the endorsement of the AMA which represents less than 10percent of the practicing doctorsactively practicing doctorsin thiscountry because not only will it increase payments but CPT coderevenue is protected That is the revenue AMA gathers from the paymentsystem that continues to be fostered in this bill which is their mainsource of revenue  One of the questions and one of the promises was If youhave what you have now and you like it you can keep it What ishappening under this bill for 11 million seniors on Medicare Advantagethat is not going to happen If they like it they are not going to beable to keep what they have You cant deny that That is the truthMedicare Advantage needs to be reformed There is no question aboutit I agree As the Senator alluded to in the Patients Choice Act weactually save 160 billion in the Patients Choice Act but we dontdiminish any of the benefits and we do that because CMS failed tocompetitively bid it because when it was writtenand I understand whowrote itwhen it was written we didnt make them competitively bid itYou could get the same savings actually get more savings and notreduce benefits in any amount if you competitively bid that productBut we have decided we are not going to do thatThe second point I make with my colleagues is the vast majority ofpeople on Medicare Advantage are on the lower bottom economically Theycant afford an AARP supplemental bill They cant afford to pay anextra 150 or 200 a month So what happens most of the time withMedicare Advantage is we bring people up to what everybody else inMedicare gets because most people can afford84 percent of the peoplein this country can afford to buy a Medicare supplemental policybecause Medicare doesnt cover everythingYour idea to try to save money I agree with But cutting thebenefits I do not agree with You are right Senator Dodd the basicguaranteed benefits have to be supplied to Medicare Advantage and thenthe things above that which you get from the supplemental policy whatyou can afford to buy is what these people get And what you aretaking away from poorest of our elderly is the ability to have the samecare that people get who can afford to buy a supplemental policy Thatis the difference I appreciate my chairman for his courtesy in yielding thetime  Reclaiming my time I ask unanimous consent to haveprinted in

a 13 billion reduction in Part Bpremium receiptsNote Under current law extra benefits include health care services net covered by Medicare such as visioncare and dental care and subsidies of beneficiaries outofpocket costs for Part B or Part D premiums orcost sharing for Medicarecovered benefits Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act extrabenefits would include health care services not covered by Medicare and subsidies of beneficiaries outofpocket costs for cost sharing for Medicarecovered benefits The fact is if you like what you have you cannot keepit for 26 million Americans You can say that is not true That iswhat CBO says Here are their numbers They sent the report to thechairman    I agree with the chairmanthat they are overpaid    This morning the claim made bythe chairman and Senator Dodd is that Medicare Advantage is notMedicare Medicare Advantage is Medicare law It was signed into lawIt is a part of Medicare The chairman would agree with that How did we get there How did we get there How did we get there towhere they are overpaid We have an organization called the Center forMedicare and Medicaid Services They are the ones who let the contractare they not They in fact are Twentyfive percent of theoverpayment has to be rebated to CMS today the Senator would agreewith that Seventyfive percent for extra benefits 25 percentrebate How did we get to where they are overpaid Because we have agovernmentcentered organization that is incompetent in terms of howthey accomplished the implementation of that billWhat was said by Senator Dodd this morningand I confronted himalready on it but it bears repeatingis that the Patients Choice Acteliminates the dollars without eliminating the services because itmandates competitive bidding with no elimination in services forMedicare Advantage So if you want to save money competitively bidrather than go through eight pages of reductions year by year in thepayments that go back to Medicare AdvantageWe have this complicated formula that nobody who listens to thisdebate would understand I know the chairman understands it because hehelped write it But the fact is 26 million Americans according toCBO will see a significant change in their Medicare benefits MedicareAdvantage is Medicare Part C We have had a kind of a differential madethat it isnt really Medicare It is Medicare And 20 percent of thepeople in this country who are on Medicare are on Medicare Part CMedicare Advantageand they like it And why do they like it Becausemost of them dont have enough money to buy a supplemental Medicarepolicy to cover the costs that are associated with deductibles andcopays and outliers So I agree with the chairman that MedicareAdvantage is overpaid but I disagree with the way you are going aboutgetting thereI also disagree with taking any of the money that is now being spenton Medicare Part C and creating another program I think all that moneyought to be put back into the longevity of MedicareIn case you dont understand how impactful that is we now owe inthe next 75 yearsactually we dont owe it because none of theSenators sitting here will be around Our kids are going to get to payback 44 trillion in money for Medicare we will have spent that weallowed to grow in fraud close to 100 billion a year and then didnothing about it This bill does essentially nothing about that 100billion a year or 1 trillion every 10 years If we were to eliminatethatwhich this bill does notwe would markedly extend the life andlower the debt that is going to come to our childrenThat leads me to the other important aspect of the health caredebate We know when you take out the funny accountingthe Enronaccountingin this bill and you match up revenues with expenses youare talking about a 25 trillion bill The chairman of theFinance Committee readily admits he has it paid for and CBO says youhave it paid for But how does he pay for it He pays for it with the26 million people who like what they have today and who are going tolose what they have today He pays for it by raising Medicare taxesThen the Medicare taxes he raises he doesnt spend on Medicare hespends that on a new entitlement program Think about what we aredoing Is there a better way to accomplish what we are doingI thank the chairman for indulging me and allowing me to continuethis long I will wind up with a couple of statements and then sharethe floor with himYou know after practicing medicine for 25 years I know we have alot of problems in health care and I appreciate the efforts of thechairman of the Finance Committee to try to find a solution for themIt is not a bipartisan solution but it is a solution And it is asolution that grows the government It puts the government in charge ofhealth care and creates blind bureaucracies that step between you andyour doctor That is one way of doing it But wouldnt a better way beto do the following Lets incentivize people to do the right thingrather than building bureaucracies and mandating how they will do itWouldnt it be better to incentivize tort reform in the StatesWouldnt it be better to incentivize physicians based on outcomesWouldnt it be better to incentivize good behavior by medical supplycompanies DME drug companies hospitals physicians throughaccountable care organizations through transparency for both qualityand priceWe dont have any of that in here What we have is a governmentcentered bureaucracy that according to CBO figures will add 25000Federal employees to implement this program25000 If you call theFederal Government how long does it take you now to get an answer Yetwe are going to add 25000 employees just in health care That is anextrapolation of the amount of agencies dividing what CBO says peragency and per cost they will come up with Wouldnt it be better tofix the things that are broken rather than to try to fix all of healthcareI heard one of my colleagues today say on the floor and I think itis true that people in America are upset with us and I think rightlyso I apologize to the American people for my arrogance I apologize tothe American people for the arrogance of this bill the thinking thatwe got it right that we can fix it in Washington that we dont haveto listen to the people out there that we dont have to listen to thepeople who are actually experiencing the consequences of what we aregoing to do I apologize for the arrogance of saying we can create a25 trillion program and that we know best Well you know what wedont know what is bestAs Senator Alexander has said so many times what needs to happen iswe need to start over We need to protect the best of Americanmedicine And what is the best Well if you get sick anywhere in theworld this is the best place in the world to get sick whether youhave insurance or not If you have heart disease or atheroscleroticdisease this is the best place in the world It costs too much thereis no question but it is the best place If you have cancer you areonethird more likely to live and be cured of that cancer living inthis country than anywhere else in the worldfor any cancer It justcosts too muchThis bill doesnt address the true causes of the cost What are thetrue causes of the cost Well No 1 we know Medicare and Medicaidunderpay and so we get a cost shift that is 1700 per year per familyin this country So you get to pay three taxes in this country onhealth care You pay your regular income tax which goes to pay forMedicaid and it also now starting to pay for Medicare as well youhave to pay 145 percent plus your employer gets to pay 145 percentof every dollar you earn for Medicare and then your health insurancecosts 1700 more per year because Medicaid and Medicare dontcompensate for the actual cost of the care because of the governmentcentered role that is played in terms of the mandates the rules andregulationsWe have a tort system in this country that costs upward of 200billion in waste a year which is 8 percent of the cost Ninety percentof all cases are settled with no wrong found at all on the part ofcaregivers and of the remaining 10 percent only 3 percent findanything wrong Of 97 percent of all the cases only 10 percent go totrial and 73 percent of that 10 percent are found in favor of theproviders So we spend all this money practicing defensive medicine andthere is not one thing in this bill to fix that problem That is 8percentTake your health care premium or your percentage of your health carepremium and apply 8 percent and that is going down the drain becauseI am ordering tests you dont need but I need to protect myself in casesomebody tries to extort money from me with a lawsuit that I know isgoing to get thrown out but I have to have it there to prove it Andthen we have inefficienciesUltimately what we need to do is to protect what is goodincentivize the correct behavior in what is wrong and go after thefraud in health care with a vengeanceput doctors in jail hospitaladministrators in jail Dont slap them with a fine and ban them fromMedicare Put them in jail The people who are stealing our grandkidsmoney up to 100 billion a year need to go to jail We play pay andchase We pay everybody and then we try to figure out whether theydeserve to get paid Nobody else does that but the government doesand that is who we are getting ready to put in charge of another 25trillion worth of health careOne of the reasons health care is in trouble in this country is that61 percent of all the health care is run through the government todayLook at TRICARE for our military look at VA care look at Indianhealth care at SCHIP and Medicaid There is an estimate of 15 billiona year in fraud in New York City alone on Medicaid That is oneestimate per year in one city on Medicaid And then Medicare And weare going to say those are running so good that we ought to moveanother 25 trillion or 15 percent of health care to where we are at76 percent of all health care is run by the government I reject thatout of hand until we can demonstrate we are good at what we doWhat we ought to be doing is turning it back The private sectorisnt the answer to everything I agree with that I cant stand 80percent of the insurance bureaucrats I deal with But at least I have afighting chance because they will call me back when I need to dosomething for a patient I never get a call back from Medicare They donot call me back The State doesnt call me back on Medicaid when Ineed to do something So I go on and do it and find somebody else topay for it That is the kind of system we have todayThink about the mothers in this country in a Medicaid system where 40percent of the primary care doctors in this country wont see theirchildren That is Medicaid That is realistic Medicaid today in ourcountry So they have a sick kid but they cant get in to a doctoreven though they have insurance They have Medicaid but they cant getin Why cant they get in Because only 1 in 50 doctors last year whograduated from medical school goes into primary care We have createdan abrupt shortage in primary care And No 2 the payment is notenough to pay for the overhead to see the child So you have a weepywoman who is worried about her sick kid and care is delayed if youcant get in It doesnt matter if you have Medicaid if you cant beseen So what happens She goes to the emergency room What happens inthe emergency room We spend three or four times as much as we shouldbecause that is an emergency department The doctor has no knowledge ofthe child or the mother He doesnt want to get sued so we have a 40percent defensive medicine cost in the emergency roomThe answer is not more government health care The answer is creatingthe incentives for people to do the right thing The only way we getthings under control in health care in this country and the only way wecreate access for people in this country is to decrease the cost ofhealth care This bill doesnt decrease the cost of health care If wewant to make sure we do what is best for American medicine while we fixwhat is wrong we will do it one significant part at a time I cantimagine dealing with thousands tens of thousands of more bureaucratsinhealth care and I cant imagine the impact it is going to have betweenme and my patients It is going to severely impact them Do I wanteverybody in this country to have available care Yes 15 percent of mypractice was gratis for people who had no care who had no money Thatis true with a lot of physicians out there in this country It is truewith a lot of labs It is true with a lot of hospitals It is true witha lot of the providers in this country They are caring peopleWe are going to tie them up We are going to put regulations andropes around them We are going to mandate rules and regulations andwe in our arrogant wisdom are going to tell Americans how they aregoing to get their health care I certainly hope not But I am notthinking about me I am thinking about our kids and our grandkidsI will end with one last comment ThomsonReuters in a study put outOctober 9 of this yearit is a very wellrespected firmtheirestimate of the 24 trillion that we spend on health care per year inthis country is that between 600 and 850 billion of it is pure wasteDefensive medicine costs and malpractice is between 250 billion to325 billion by their estimate Not one thing in this bill to addressthatnot one thingFraud there is between 125 and 175 billion per yearinsignificantin this bill 2 billion to 3 billionAdministrative inefficiency 17 percentbetween 100 and 150billion wasted on paperwork in health care every yearProvider errorsthat is mebetween 75 and 100 billion that iseither wrong diagnosis or failure to treat appropriately It is thesmallest of allWhat are we doing We are going to tell the providersthe hospitalsthe medical device companies the drug companies the doctors theradiologists the labs the physical therapistswe are going to tellthem how to do it That is not where the problem isMy hope is that the American people will come to their senses andsay Wait a minute Slow down Stop Fix the important things Fix theworst thing first the next thing second the next thing third thenext thing fourth The unintended consequences of this bill are goingto be unbelievable Nobody is smart enough to figure all this outnobody Nobody on my staff nobody on the Finance Committee nobody inMajority Leader Reids office can predict all the unintendedconsequences that are going to come about because of this billThe chairman has been awfully patient and I see my colleague here tooffer an amendment With that I yield the floorThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Burris The Senator from Oregon isrecognized
S_WY_ENZI,2009-12-10,The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from New Hampshire  I cannot fault the Senator from Montana for his efforts toget a bipartisan solution As I have said many times I am sorry he hadto be cut off by phony time deadlines that kept us from reaching thatkind of a solution and then winding up with things that are in thisbill we are talking about that were not a part of our discussionsagain the things that were proposed by people on this side of theaisle that are not in that billThere were some possibilities for solutions But we wound up withthat same situation of We won the election we get to write the billand it has to be done quickly So I am disappointed in the wholeprocess There has been a bipartisan proposal The chairman of the BudgetCommittee and the ranking member of the Budget Committee have proposeda commission and that bipartisan deal is being chastised here So weare on the bill where 64 percent of the amendments that have beenfiled so far were filed by the Democrats and I keep wondering why theyare filibustering their own billThen when something bipartisan does come up they are opposed to thattoo I know they think the only good ideas come from the other side ofthe aisle and I do get frustrated with that   President I appreciate the statistics the Senator fromMontana cited about how long we have been debating this and how manyamendments we have done That is how few amendments we have doneactually The majority is now filibustering their own bill I have noidea why that is happening We have been calling for votes on both ofthese amendments that have been proposed so far and havent been ableto get the votes I dont understand how they can talk about how manyamendments are being doneI also have to voice some other frustration I dont know how manytimes I have heard the exact same speech by the Senator from IllinoisMr Durbin on this floor talking about the amount of hours that havebeen spent together working on these bills in the HELP Committee andthe Gang of 6 in the Finance Committee It isnt about how many hourswe spend together It isnt about how many hours we spend on the floorIt is whether we are accepting ideas I understand the other party wonthe last election but somehow they will have to get over this attitudethat they won the election they get to write the bill they dont haveto take any ideas from anybody elseIn the HELP Committee I keep pointing out that most of the things weturned in were kind of punctuation corrections and spellingcorrections Any ideas we actually had that appeared to be accepted tobe in the bill were ripped out of the bill before it was actuallyformally printed without talking to us What kind of bipartisan dealis thatAnother thing with the HELP Committee we have only had 10 days ofdebate on this We did more than that in the HELP Committee when wewere marking up the billBut we are having in the words of Yogi Berra deja vu all overagain When we were having that markup the majority withheld asignificant part of the bill a big part of the bill It was thegovernmentrun option part of the bill They wouldnt give us thewording on that I think they were still writing it Maybe that is whatis happening right now too But we couldnt get the text we were goingto write amendments on so that we could deal with the bill I thinkAmerica noticed that in August People said How come everybody isntreading the bill You cant read what you dont haveThe point I am making is right now the newspapers are full ofinformationwell speculation it has to be speculationabout whatthis new Medicare expansion does I havent run into anybody who hasseen the text of that I have asked some of the media and they didntsee the text They got a briefing We havent even had a briefing Themajority side has had a briefing but our folks who have talked tothose folks said Wow that was pretty general How could you make upyour mind on whether you are going to support it based on the littlebit of information you received That is not the way to run any kind ofan organization especially if you want bipartisan votesYou cant write the bill in secret which is what was done with thisbill There wasnt a Republican involved in the behindthedoor stuffLeader Reid did to put together the bill we have now That is notbipartisan Therehasnt been a single person from the Republican side briefed on thisnew proposal that is going to save the worldActually I noticed that the American Medical Association suddenlyleft the bill and said This will be the worst thing that could happento us The hospital associations which have been strong supporters ofthe bill have also said this wont work particularly the Mayo Clinicwhich we have been holding up as one of the prime examples of the wayto do health care saying If this Medicare expansion happens it willcost us millions We wont be able to provide the kind of care we havebeen providingWhat is the deal around here When are we going to actually get tosee something When is the majority actually going to share with usthis marvelous idea they have had What kind of a way to run a businessis thatAre we going to recess for the weekend I dont want to recess forthe weekend I am conscious of the 11 days we have been debating andwe have only covered 14 amendments We have a lot of importantamendments that either will be a part of the bill or will help thepeople in this country to understand what is being thrust on themThere has never been a bill of such importance as this one from thestandpoint of how many people it affects We are talking aboutreforming health care in America That is everybody That is everysingle individual every single provider Every single business will beaffected by this billWe talk about 2074 pages which seems like a lot It would be for anormal bill that you could debate in a limited period which is what weare being asked to do But 2074 pages isnt nearly enough to coverhealth care for AmericaSo why is it only 2074 pages There are hundreds of references inthere to how the Secretary of Health and Human Services is going tosolve all the problems The things we arent able to put into detail inthere we just assign to her and she will magically be able to solvethe problems for American health care After all it is her DepartmentBut that is not going to happen You cant give that many assignmentsto any agency any department any group of people and expect them ina reasonable amount of time to come up with solutions solutions thatought to be decided on by this body the elected officialsnotappointed officials but elected officials That is not going to happenwith this billThe only way that could happen is if we took significant parts of itand put it up one piece at a time and solved it That is what seniorsare asking for They are asking for us to take the Medicare part andgive them some assurance that when we are through it will work We arenot even getting to see a significant part of it We have been pointingout how taking 464 billion out of Medicare will break it will ruinit You just cant steal 464 billion out of Medicare and have it comeout good The majority recognizes that That is why they put in thespecial commission that is going to come to us each and every year andsuggest the kinds of cuts we ought to make to keep that solventThe biggest thing we ought to do is take these cuts that are providedand make them actually apply only to Medicare But how are you going tofund the expansion of Medicare now down to age 55 How do you do thatI guess you charge a premium to those people That is kind of the rumorthat is out there How big of a premium How big of a premium are yougoing to thrust on those people I suspect it is going to be the olderand the sicker people in that 55 to 64age category who are going towant to shift over to MedicareIf it is a higher premium so the system stays solventhaving nothingto do of course with age because we cannot do that under the billor sickness because we cannot do that under the billand those aregood ideasbut those better be up in that range of the highrisk poolsthat the States already havePeople come to me and say You have to do something about health carebecause we cannot afford that highrisk pool it is too expensiveWell how much more are we going to expect the young people to pitch inin their paycheck That is where the Medicare money comes from rightnow They deduct a portion of the paycheck from every single workingAmerican and that goes into Medicare and gets paid out right away toMedicare recipients none of whom or hardly any of whom are the onespaying into the system They are hoping that system is going to bethere when they get olderWhat I am asking for is for the majority to show us the paper andgive us a reasonable time to look at it and give America a reasonabletime to look at it I do not think it is unreasonable for that to be onthe Internet That is a significant part of the bill That would be asignificant bill all by itself It was held from our view when the HELPCommittee did it Incidentally that HELP Committee billthat was puttogether in 2 weeks without our help and put on usparts of it werewithheld as this has been withheld until the last minute and thenthrust inThat is what created this enormous outrage across America of Did youread the bill How can you read the bill if you have not seen anythingin it if it has not been given to you I do not think it is intendedto be given to us until we have to shuffle this thing through at theendThe anticipation was to get this done by Christmastime and themajority side keeps talking about getting this done by ChristmastimeWill we have time to read it before Christmastime Will we have achance to do any amendments on it before Christmastime I am willing tostay around and work through the weekend and keep doing amendments butI would like to see this marvelous idea that is going to solve thewhole problem If it was that marvelous and that good of an idea Ithink it would be shared alreadyMr President I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of ourtimeThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Montana  We have not even seen thisnew piece Nobody wants to show us the new piece They keep talkingabout it They have leaked it to the newspapers but they will not showit to us and then they keep talking about how this bill is going tosolve the deficits for this country that there is 157 billion orsomething saved in the first 10 years That is onlyonlyif you usethe phoney accounting they are using It is only if you dont do thedoc fix It is only if you dont solve the myriad of other things wehave brought outWe have a bill they keep talking about as being the solution Americahas figured it out but the Democrats havent figured it outI see the leader is on the Senate floor I yield the floorRecognition of the Minority LeaderThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Republican leader isrecognized  President it is my understanding the leader spokeunder leader time So we should have an adequate 10 minutes to allocate to theSenator
S_IA_GRASSLEY,2009-12-03, But I do not think the Senator wants togo down that road because do not forget there are 6 years ofprograms of expenditures and there is 10 years of revenue coming inIf you want to play that game you can pay down the entire nationaldebt  I cannot respond to that because I do not know that forsure So I do not want to respond But if you tell me I tend tobelieve everything you tell me  President as I stated earlier the Bennetamendment as written does not protect Medicare So I have amodification I would like to present that ensures Medicare savings inthis bill are not being siphoned off to finance a new and separateentitlement programTo that end I ask unanimous consent to modify the amendment byadding the following before the period at the end of subsection b   and furthermore that notwithstanding any otherprovision of this Act or amendment made by this Act netMedicare savings specified in the most recent estimateavailable from the Director of the Congressional BudgetOffice before enactment are appropriated to the Secretary andshall be used for such purposes and to maintain Medicarepolicies for home health services skilled nursing facilityservices hospice care hospital services and benefitsprovided by the Medicare Advantage program as under theprovisions of such Title as specified on the day before thedate of enactment of this ActEnd of my amendment  President I would like to also make a statementrelated to the amendment that is being presented by the Senator fromColorado Speaking for several Members on my sidehopefully for allthe Members on my sidewe are very concerned as I think we have allmade clear by now that the Medicare savings in this bill are beingused not for preserving Medicare but instead are being used tofinance the creation of a new Federal entitlement programMy understanding of the purpose of the amendment of the Senator fromColorado is to indicate that Medicare savings will be used forextending the solvency of Medicare and the trust fund reducingMedicare premiums and other cost sharing for beneficiaries and toimprove or expand Medicare benefits and access to providersNobody can argue with that purpose the Senator has expressed or hisamendment expresses But the concern on our side that we have with thisamendment is it does not require that the savings from Medicare wouldonlywith emphasis upon the word onlybe used for that purposeAs the Congressional Budget Office has made clear the cuts inMedicare in this bill are not being used solely for Medicare as theSenators amendment suggests but instead are being usedmostly to fund the creation of an entirely new and separate subsidyprogram For the Senator to accomplish what he intends to accomplishwould require entirely different language to ensure that savings fromMedicare in this bill would only be used to protect Medicare benefitsfor seniors as the law now expressesThe right approach would include language making sure seniors havethe same access as they have today to home health services skillednursing facilities and services hospice care hospital servicespreventive benefits and the benefits provided in the MedicareAdvantage Program So the Senate it seems to me should also ensurethat Medicare savings in this bill are not being siphoned off tofinance a new and separate entitlement programIt is very clear to meand I hope we are able to make it clear topeople all 100 Senatorsthat the Bennet amendment as written doesnot protect MedicareI yield the floor  President I will take a short minute to respond toa question But our side has 7  Could we discuss this maybe a little bit later whatyou brought up   Then if I may President I would like to make very clear thatthis objection confirms that the Bennet amendment does not protectMedicare as the other side claims that it protects MedicareI yield the floor  President today I am introducing the CleanRenewable Energy Advancement Tax Extension Jobs Act of 2009 or theCREATE Jobs Act of 2009 for short This is a bill to help all kinds ofbusinesses create jobs and continue pushing ahead on the development ofclean renewable energy My bill extends the tax credit for

S_IL_DURBIN,2009-12-11, President is there a unanimous consent order ofbusinessI would like to say at the outset I respect very much my colleaguefrom the State of Kansas He and I have worked on many issues togetherIn fact we traveled together to Africa a memorable trip for both ofus I am sure visiting the Democratic Republic of Congo Rwanda andmeeting a lot of people in desperate straits I thank him for thatI know he is now preparing for another public career in the State ofKansas with the blessing of the Kansas voters But in the meantime hecontinues to be a very important vital voice in the Senate I thankhim for that as wellWe do disagree on health care reform I know he has had a chance toexplain his point of view I will say I disagree with many of hisconclusions about what we are about what we are trying to accomplishThis is the bill that is before us when we return to the health carereform debate It is 2074 pages long It is the product of 1 yearswork by two major committees in the Senate The House ofRepresentatives spent a similar period of time in three differentcommittees working on it to come up with their work product which theypassed just a few weeks agoThis is historic because we have been promising this and threateningthis and talking about this for decades It was Theodore Roosevelt whofirst raised the question about whether America could accept thechallenge of providing health care for every citizen That was over 100years ago Then of course Harry Truman who in a more modern eraissued the same challenge He was confronted by his critics who saidHe is talking about socializing medicine Must be socialism that HarryTruman is proposing The idea diedThen again Lyndon Johnson raised it in the early 1960s He was amaster of the Senate as he has been characterized in a book that hasbeen written about him He believed he had the power to make thishappen to deal with the health care system across the board in AmericaIt turned out he made a significant contribution with the enactment ofMedicare and Medicaid but could not reach the goal of universal healthcare or comprehensive health care reformThis President President Obama came to us and issued the samechallenge He said we have reached a point of no return The currenthealth care system in America is unsustainable it is unaffordable andthe cost of health care goes up dramatically Ten years ago a familyof four paid an average of 6000 a year 500 a month for health careinsurance Now that is up to twice that amount 12000 average for afamily of four 1000 a month In 8 years with projected increases incosts we expect that the monthly premium for the family of four to goup to 2000 a month 24000 a year We know that represents 40percent of earnings for many people That is absolutely unsustainableWhat we have tried to do first and foremost is addressaffordability How can we make health insurance protection moreaffordable for more families How can we start lessening the annualincrease in premiums and actually help people by substantially cuttingthe cost of premiums for many families It is a big challenge and wehave I think risen to the challenge with this billThe other side of the aisle has ideas they have amendments theyhave speeches they have charts but they do not have a comprehensivehealth care reform bill They do not have a bill that has been sentover to the Congressional Budget Office carefully read and evaluatedIt took weeks to do it They do not have a bill that came back from theCongressional Budget Office considered to be the neutral observer ofaction on Capitol Hill They do not have a bill that came back from theCBO that has been characterized as actually reducing the deficitThis bill according to the Congressional Budget Office will reduceAmericas deficit over the next 10 years by 130 billion and over thefollowing 10 years another 650 billion It is not just dealing withhealth care reform it is dealing with the costs of health care to ourgovernment and reducing our expenditures by significant amounts It isthe largest deficitreduction bill ever considered on the floor of theSenateAlthough the Republicans have many ideas they do not have anythingthat matches this bill in terms of deficit reduction or bringing downthe cost of health care They have not produced a bill which willextend the reach of health insurance coverage to 94 percent of ourpeople in this country which this bill doesFor the first time in the history of the United States of America 94percent of our American citizens will have peace of mind knowing theyhave health insurance Today 50 million do not This bill will take 30million off the uninsured rolls and put them in insurance plans thatcan protect their families and it will help them pay for the premiumsIf people are making less than 400 percent of povertywhich inlaymans terms is about 80000 a year in income If your family makes80000 or less we provide in this bill that we will help you pay foryour premiums The lower your income the more we will help payIf you are making for example as an individual less than 14000 ayear you will not pay for your health care It will be covered byMedicaid the program that is now nationwide and you will not have topay a premium Then as you make more money you will pay a little bitof a premium with help from this billThe Republicans have not produced a plan of any kind that deals withhelping families of limited means modest means pay for their healthinsurance premiums We have The Congressional Budget Office has scoredit One of the major provisions in this billand one I think mostpeople will identify with quicklyis the fact that health insurancereform is included too There is a Patients Bill of Rights in thisbill It basically says we should bring an end to the discriminatorypractices of health insurance companies against American citizens Weknow what we are talking aboutFriends of mine a family I am closer to than any other family inSpringfield IL has a son fighting cancer He is a young man in hisforties He has young children in high school He was diagnosed withmelanoma just a few years ago His oncologist has worked with him withchemotherapy and radiation and with the kind of treatment and drugs andsurgeries he needed As a result of it he has gone through some toughsurgeries and tough treatment His oncologist said at one point Wehave a drug we believe will help you He gave him the drug and thedrug in fact arrested the development of his cancerShortly after the drug was prescribed and administered his healthinsurance company that he paid into for years came back and said Wewill not cover that drug The drug costs 12000 a month It isimpossible for him as the coach of a baseball team at one of ouruniversities to come up with that kind of money His family borrowedmoney to pay for one of the treatments and now they are suing theinsurance company in the hopes that they can get coverageAfter all those years paying in when they finally needed thatcoverage they turned him down I hope he wins that lawsuit This is avery profitable insurance company It is a company that should bepaying but they are not That is one example of thousands we couldtalk aboutThe purpose of this bill is to make sure a friend of mine hisfamily and other families just like his have a fighting chance againstthese insurance companies We say in this bill we are going to providea way for protection for people with a preexisting condition that ifyou have a history of high cholesterol or high blood pressure if youhave some cancer in your family it is not going to disqualify you Youare still going to be eligible for health insurance a policy you canaffordWe also say when it comes to your childrenyou know how it istoday you learn the hard waywhen your kids who are on the familyplan reach the age of 24 they are off We extend that to age 26 whichI think is a little more peace of mind particularly for studentsgraduating from college looking for jobs these days It is not easy Wewant to make sure they are covered with health insurance while they arepaying off their student loans and building their career That is inthis billThere is not a bill from the Republican side of the aisle that dealswith the Patients Bill of Rights In fact it is a rare Senator on theother side of the aisle who even stands and is critical of healthinsurance companies in the way they are treating people in thiscountryI do not know if my friends on the other side of the aisle get backhome enough to meet with some of these families Surely they do Theymust receive mail that tells them about these stories we have all heardabout You would think they would be endorsing our approach in thisbill Instead they are critical of it from start to finishThey talk a lot about taxes I want you to know under this bill ifyou have a small business with 25 or fewer employees we actuallyprovide tax breaks to help you provide insurance for your employeesThere are a lot of businesses momandpop businesses for examplethat cannot afford health insurance that will have a chance now becauseof tax breaks hereThen when it comes to paying for premiums I mentioned earlier ifyou make 80000 or less we provide tax breaks in helping you pay forit The cost of it in tax breaks is 440 billion over 10 years It is ahuge amount of money we are providing to American citizens to give thema chance to pay for their health insurance premiums All we hear fromthe other side is Oh this bill is going to raise taxes It does raisesome It raises taxes on health insurance companies for what we callCadillac health care policiesWe can debate for a long time whether that level of policy 25000is a reasonable level or should be something different But the factis it is a tax on the health insurance company It will likely resultin fewer policies that are that grand and that expansive being issuedI think this is a bill that moves in the right direction It is abill that makes insurance more affordable It is a bill that does notincrease the deficit it reduces it It is a bill that gives people afighting chance against health insurance companies that discriminateagainst their customers It is a bill that extends the coverage ofhealth insurance of 94 percent of Americans It is a bill that looks atputting Medicare on sound footing It adds 5 years of solvency toMedicare5 years There has not been a bill produced on the other sideof the aisle that even adds 1 yearthat I am aware of It adds 5 more years of solvency That is thereason why this bill has been supported by the American Association ofRetired Persons We have support of medical professionals seniororganizations and consumer groups all across America They know as wedo we cannot wait any longerI also wish to make the point that the Senate bill offers significantsavings for seniors The CMS Actuary projects a net 469 billion inMedicare and Medicaid savings over 10 years slightly more than theCongressional Budget Office It extends the life of the Medicare trustfund according to the Office of the Actuary by 9 years That islonger than anyone has projected in previous forecasts but it is asignificant increase almost doubling the life of the Medicare trustfund over what it currently would beIt reduces premiums by 1250 a month by the year 2019 or 300 percouple per year Slowing Medicare growth will lower health care costsfor seniors as well as younger Americans Not only will there be apremium savings but coinsurance will fall as wellThe Senate bill slows the growth of health care costs The Actuaryreport we have for example says     Reductions in Medicarepayment updates for providers the actions of the Independent MedicareAdvisory Board and the excise tax on highcost employersponsoredhealth insurance would have a significant downward impact on futurehealth care cost growth ratesThe bend in the health care cost curve is evident Health care costsunder the Senate bill begin to decline as cost savings begin to kickinI have not mentioned this bill focuses on prevention and wellnesstoo If there is one thing we need it is to encourage people to takecare of themselves and to get a helping hand for the tests they need tostay healthy and to monitor their conditions This preventive care andwellness though we have not been credited by the Congressional BudgetOffice is an important element of this billI think there is one thing on which we should all agree The cost ofhealth care particularly for small businesses is very difficult Onthe Senate floor both Democrats and my friends on the other side ofthe aisle have recognized small businesses are struggling to pay forhealth insurance But there is a real difference We have offered asolution one that is comprehensive and one that has been scored andcarefully analyzed by the Congressional Budget OfficeUnfortunately that has not happened on the other side Theirapproach is basically to criticize what we have proposed but to offerno alternative If they are happy with the current system I understandthat If they will concede that it is hard to produce a bill like thisI would understand that But merely to criticize this withoutalternative a comprehensive alternative that has been carefullyanalyzed I dont think is a responsible approach to the seriousproblem that we face todayThere are reallife stories of people who have contacted me One ofthem I will tell you about involves a small business Right now we knowthat one sick employee of a small business can drive the cost of healthcare for the whole company to limits where they just cant afford itMy friends Martha and Harry Burrows whom I have met are smallbusiness owners in Chicago and they have to wrestle with this problemand try to run a successful business at the same time When they openedtheir toy store Timeless Toys 16 years ago they promised to providehealth insurance to their fulltime employees Martha Burrows saidSince we were covered we wanted to offer the same benefitto our employeesBut as their health care premiums have skyrocketed with leaps of morethan 20 percent at a time the commitment has taken its toll on theirbusiness Providing health insurance to their fulltime staff of sevenmeant cuts not only to profits but also to the wages of theiremployees In general the older employees faced even higher costs Weshouldnt put our Nations employers in a position where the healthcosts of an older worker can make such a huge differenceMarcia saysI dont like making decisions that way I want to basehiring decisions on the quality of the personThe legislation on the floor incidentally deals with the rating ofpremium costs for senior citizens for example and makes a fairerrating system Currently health insurance companies in America areexempt from the antitrust laws Under a bill known as MCCarranFerguson passed in the 1940s they are exempt along with organizedbaseball which means the insurance companieshealth insurancecompanies and otherscan literally sit down in a room and conspirecollude agree on prices they are going to charge If any othercompanies that were supposed to be competing did that in America theywould be sued but not the insurance companies So they can set premiumsand agree on what the premiums will be and they can divide up themarket for the sale of their products sending some companies to onetown and some to another making sure they do not compete against oneanotherThat is the reality of health insurance today What we provide inthis bill is protection against the ratings which discriminate againstpeople because they are elderly or because they are women We putlimits to the rating differences that will be allowed in healthinsurance policies There is no bill I know of from the Republican sidethat even considers or addresses that problemMr President one of the issues that I have tried to focus on in themidst of this recession is our foreclosure crisis Back in December of2006 when the housing markets were humming along and the bankers andbrokers were raking in money the Center for Responsible Lendingpublished a report called Losing Ground That report in Decemberof 2006 estimated that nearly 2 million homes would be lost toforeclosure in the coming years due largely to shoddy subprimemortgagesHere is what the Mortgage Bankers Association told the WashingtonPost when they heard of this study It was authored by the Center forResponsible LendingThe report is wildly pessimistic because most homeownershave prime loans and are not at financial riskThat is what a senior economist at the Mortgage Bankers Associationsaid in December of 2006 He went on to sayThe subprime market is a small part of the overall marketLending industry officials have said that regulatory actioncould injure the subprime marketWhen he speaks of regulatory action he means regulating thesesubprime marketsOn the floor of the Senate I was involved in a debate with a Senatorfrom Texas named Phil Gramm I offered an amendment to a bankruptcybill which Senator Grassley and I worked on which said If you areguilty of predatory lending you will be precluded in bankruptcy frompursuing your claim That was debated on the Senate floor and debatingon the other side against my amendment was Senator Phil Gramm of Texaswho said on the floor of the SenateIf the Durbin amendment passes it will destroy thesubprime mortgage marketWell my amendment failed by one vote and the subprime mortgagemarket continued until it collapsed just a couple of years ago I wishI had had another vote for my amendmentAt the time this debate took place in December of 2006 about 25percent of home loans were subprime So the mortgage bankersunfortunately misled the public about the state of the market at thetime to wave away warnings about any crisis that might be followingand we all know what that has meant to this countryI go back to that episode now because 3 years later in 2009 we havehad more than 2 million foreclosures something the Mortgage BankersAssociation said wouldnt happen In fact the Mortgage BankersAssociation has recently announced that in the third quarter of thisyear nearly one in seven families paying mortgages in this countrywere either behind on their payments or already in foreclosureone outof seven people holding mortgages today It is hard to imagine That isthe highest it has ever beenThe statement from the Mortgage Bankers Association saidDespite the recession ending in midsummer the decline inmortgage performance continuesThree years ago the rosy scenario they painted has now morphed intoamuch more serious situation which they cannot ignore I have beentalking about this foreclosure crisis since early in 2007 I stand herewith some regret and say it is getting worseIn Illinois foreclosure filings in the sixcounty region aroundChicago went up 67 percent in the last quarter This isnt just aproblem for the city of Chicago New filings in Cook County mainlysuburban areas were down 46 percent last quarter The problemunfortunately has migrated to the suburbs All of the socalledcollar counties around Chicago have experienced massive increasesin foreclosure activity Kane County a nearin county to the city ofChicago saw foreclosure filings increase 97 percent in the lastquarter over a comparable period last yearI know the administration is working on this The Home AffordableModification Program is helping some families I know Treasury hasstepped up naming and shaming and hoping that it will provide more datafor the public on which banks are actually trying Some arenot muchbut some are Many are not trying at all to renegotiate mortgages forpeople facing foreclosure But no matter how much the TreasuryDepartment leans on these bankers the big banks that service most ofthese troubled mortgages have simply not stepped up to the plateTreasury reported yesterday that 33 million families are eligiblefor the Home Affordable Modification Program Those are the familieswho are at least 2 months behind on their mortgages and in serious riskof being thrown out in the street How many families based on this 33million families eligible for this program have been able to get abank to commit to a permanent loan modification that will keep them intheir homes There were 31000 out of 33 million less than onetenthof 1 percent of the families in trouble have been able to work out apermanent solution with their bankers That is disgracefulThe big banks that created this mess continue to stand in the way ofcleaning it up They are making billions of dollars while foreclosingon millions of American families Shaming the banks with speeches onthe floor of the Senate isnt going to work We have learned the hardway that many banks are beyond embarrassment You cant embarrassbankers who take billions of taxpayer dollars to stay solvent and toovercome their bad banking policies then turn around and pay millionsout in bonuses to the officers of the same banks You cant publiclyshame bankers into doing something when they simply dont careBut lets be clear Congress hasnt done its part either We have notdone enough to make these banks help the American people who need somehelp I will continue to come to the floor to remind my colleagues thatwe must address this crisis far more aggressively than we have and Iwill continue to look for ways to helpOne last statistic The Wall Street Journal ran a frontpage storyrecently highlighting that one in four homeowners who are paying amortgage today owes more on their mortgage than their house is worthOne in four homeowners is making house payments on a home that is nowunderwater If you owe more than your house is worth and have no extracash lying around you are really vulnerable If there is a sickness inyour family a health care emergency a job loss you could lose yourhome If you are underwater you are likely to stay thereThe 107 million families who find their mortgages are higher thanthe value of their homes are at serious risk of foreclosure Over400000 of those families are at risk in my home State of IllinoisJPMorgan Chase estimates that home prices wont hit bottom until nextyear so it is going to get worse before it gets betterSo do we stand idly by and watch thiswatch people lose their lifessavings and their homes watch these boardedup homes spring up acrossour neighborhoods around towns large and small across America andshake our heads and say it is inevitable We dont have to What wehave to do is lean on these banks legally with new laws that putpressure on them to make a difference Dont appeal to their betternature We have tried that and it didnt work We have to use the lawWe have to stand up for this economy and putting it back on its feetand we have to make the point of saying to these bankers that they haveto negotiate these mortgagesWe need to do our part in the Senate As we focus on health care andjobs and the state of the economy lets not lose sight of thisforeclosure crisis that is devastating neighborhoods across thecountry The economy will struggle to fully recover until more familiesare confident enough in their homes that they are willing to go out andgo shopping again We must do moreMr President I yield the floor  Here is what Iunderstood happened I know Senator Dodd came to the HELP Committeewith a base bill to start with but it is my understanding in theprocess 100 Republican amendments were accepted on that bill If I ammistaken I know the Senator will correct me but  President it is my understanding that we have goneover the original allocation of time and Senator MCCain is coming tothe floor We will of course offer to the minority side whateverextra time we will use so that there will be a like amount available tothem and I will make every effort to shorten my remarksThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The majority has not exceeded itstime There is 12 minutes remaining on the clock But whatever we promised theminority side they will receive like treatment on whatever time weuse President yesterday the majority leader propoundeda unanimous consent request to have four votes with respect to thehealth care bill The Republican leader objected to the consent sincehe indicated they had just received a copy of Senator Lautenbergssidebyside amendment to the Dorgan amendment and so they needed timeto review the amendmentTherefore I now ask unanimous consent that following the period ofmorning business today the Senate resume consideration of HR 3590for the purpose of considering the pending Crapo amendment to commitand the Dorgan amendment No 2793 as modified that Senator Baucus berecognized to call up a sidebyside amendment to the Crapo motionthat once that amendment has been reported by number SenatorLautenberg be recognized to call up his sidebyside amendment to theDorgan amendment as modified that prior to each of the votesspecified in the agreement there be 5 minutes of debate equallydivided and controlled in the usual form that upon the use or yieldingback of the time the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to theLautenberg amendment that upon disposition of the Lautenbergamendment the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the Dorganamendment that upon disposition of that amendment the Senate proceedto vote in relation to the Baucus amendment and that upon dispositionof that amendment the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Crapomotion to commit that no other amendments be in order during thependency of this agreement and that the above referenced amendmentsand motion to commit be subject to an affirmative 60vote thresholdthat if they achieve that threshold they then be agreed to and themotion to reconsider be laid upon the table if they do not achievethat threshold they then be withdrawnThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Is there objection  President this is the second time we have offered tocall amendments for a vote and the complaint from the other side isyou are not calling amendments for a voteHow many times do we have to ask for permission to call amendmentsfor a vote run into objections from the Republican side and then hearthe speech Why arent we voting on amendmentsI am certain that in the vast expansion of time and space we canwork out something fair in terms of the number of amendments on bothsides In fact maybe the next round will have more Republicanamendments than Democratic amendments I dont know how many Republicanamendments or Democratic amendments we have voted on so far We can getan official tally but that really seems like a very minor element tostop the debate on health carebecause we need to have an equal numberof amendments Cant grownups work things out like this and with anunderstanding that we will resolve them If we cant then forgoodness sake dont subject us to these arguments on the Senate floorthat we are not calling amendments for a vote We have just tried 2days in a row and the Republicans once again have stopped us withobjections That is a factI would implore the leadershipnot my friend from Wyoming I know heis doing what he is instructed to do by the leadersfor goodnesssake lets break this logjam Lets not at the end of the day saywell we stopped debating this bill when we should have been debatingit when we have offered 2 days in a row in good faith to have actualamendments offered and debatedI would also say Mr President this is the bill we are consideringHR 3590 when we return to it This is the health care reform billand this is a bill which has been the product of a lot of work A lotof work has gone into it both in the House and in the Senate In theSenate two different committees met literally for months writing thisbill and they should take that time because this is the mostsignificant and historic and comprehensive bill I have ever consideredin my time in Congressmore than 25 years This bill affects everyperson in Americaevery person in the gallery everyone watching us onCSPAN every person in America It addresses an issue that everyAmerican is concerned aboutthe future of health care how we aregoing to make it affordableAt a time when fewer businesses offer the protection of healthinsurance at a time when individuals find themselves unable to buyhealth insurance that is good and that they can afford at a time whenhealth insurance companies are turning down people right and left forvirtually any excuse related to preexisting conditions we cannotcontinue along this road Those who are fighting change those who areresisting reform are basically standing by a broken systemThere are many elements in American health care that are the best inthe world but the basic health care system in America is fundamentallyflawed This is the only civilized Nation on Earth where you can diefor lack of health insuranceliterally dieMr President 45000 people a year die because they do not have thehealth insurance they need to bring them to the doctor they need at acritical moment in life They do not have the health insurance theyneed to afford the surgical procedure they need to avoid a deadlydiseaseIf a person has a 5000 deductible on their health insurance and adoctor tells themas a man who wrote me from Illinois saidyou shouldhave a colonoscopy sir there is an indication you could have aproblem that could develop into colon cancer and it could be fatalThe man says How much is the colonoscopyWell it is 3000 out of pocketThe man says I cant afford it I just cant pay for itSo he doesnt get the colonoscopy and bad things can occur Thathappens in America but it doesnt happen in any other civilizedcountryIt is true in some systems he may have had to wait an extra week or amonth but he gets the care he needs He doesnt die for lack of healthinsurance That is what is going on in America Almost 50 millionAmericans without health insurance todayalmost 50 million in thisgreat and prosperous Nationwent to bed last night without the peaceof mind of the coverage of health insurance This bill addresses thatAt the end of the day 94 percent of the people living in Americawill be able to sleep at night knowing they have a decent healthinsurance plan That is an amazing step forward That is a stepconsistent with the establishment of Social Security which finallytook the worry away from seniors and their families about what wouldhappen to grandma and grandpa when they stopped workingI remember those days There was a time when grandma and grandparetired and moved in with their kids Remember that era I do Ithappened in our family and they didnt have any choice They had tobecause they had modest jobs and not a lot of savings and they put iton their kids to find that spare bedroom or let them sleep in basementthat was made over so that they would have a comfortable and safe placeto beSocial Security changed that for most American families This billwill change health care for most American families The same thing istrue with Medicare The critics of Medicareand they have been legionon the floor of the Senateignore the obvious 45 million Americanswill have peace of mind to know that they can get affordable healthcare once they reach the age of 65 They would not lose their lifesavings They will get a good doctor a good hospital and a goodoutcomeIsnt that what America is all about Isnt that why we are supposedto be here Why dont we have more support The Republican side of theaisle only comes to say what is wrong with the idea of health careSteven Pearlstein in this mornings Washington Postwhich I hopesome of my Republican colleagues will readtalks about a lostopportunity which the Republicans haveWe have invited the Republicans from day one to be part of theconversation about health care reform Senator Enzi of Wyoming is onewho assiduously gave every effort spent 61 days trying to reach abipartisan agreement It failed but at least he tried I commend himfor tryingToo many others on the other side didnt try But Steven PearlsteinwritesOne can only imagine how Republicans could have reshapedhealthreform legislation in the Senate    Withoutquestion they could have won more deficitreducing costsavings in the Medicare program by setting limits on spendinggrowth and reforming the way health care is organizedprovided and paid for And they could have begun to realizetheir goal of consumerdriven health care by insistingthat the new insurance exchanges offer at least one planbuilt around individual health savings accounts andcatastrophic coveragePearlstein goes on to talk about the possibilities He saysThey could have taken a page from John MCCains platformand insisted on replacing the current tax exclusion ofhealthcare benefits with a flat tax credit that would bemore progressive and put downward pressure on insurancepremiumsI am not guaranteeing that any of those proposals would have been inbut they all could have been in if we had a dialog Instead of adialog we have a shouting match one side of the aisle shouting at theother side of the aisle It is exactly the stereotype of Washingtonwhich America has come to hate America wants us to solve problems notget into these you know furflying debates where we see who can getthe rhetorical better of the other They want us to solve problems butunfortunately we are still waiting for the first Republican to crossthe aisle on the passage of this bill and work with us The door isstill open The invitation is still there The idea of doing nothing isunacceptable and that should be the messageThe fact is there is no comprehensive Republican health care reformbillperiod Senators come to the floor such as Senator Coburn andsay I have some good ideas I bet he does I may even subscribe tothem But his ideas have not gone through the rigor this bill has gonethrough This bill was sent to the Congressional Budget Office andscored asking the basic questions No 1 will it add to the deficitThey came back and told us No the Democratic health care reform billwill in fact save money 130 billion in 10 years 650 billion inthe second 10 years We asked them Is it going to insure moreAmericans They came back and said Yes 94 percent will be insuredwhen this is over That same rigor has not been applied to theRepublican ideas because it is hard it is tough and it takes time Icommend them for their thoughtful ideas but to say they have somethingthey can match against this bill comprehensive reformjust go to theRepublican Senate Web site and look for the Republican comprehensivereform bill Do you know what you will find You will find theDemocratic bill That is all they can talk about They dont have acomprehensive health care reform billBut we are not going to quit America we cannot go home forChristmas until we get this job doneAfter we have been here 12 straight days debating we kind of getinto a trancelike catatonic state where we cant remember what ourlast speech was about and we go to sleep at night thinking about whatwe might have said on the floor or what we are going to say tomorrowBut the fact is we have to stay and do our job not just in passinghealth care reform but doing something significant to help theunemployed and deal with jobs and the economy before we leave here totry to enjoy Christmas or what is left of it or the holiday seasonwith our familiesThis is a job that has to be done I am sorry we have reached a pointwhere the Republicans have not been actively involved in creating thisbill We tried for the longest time In the HELP Committee whereSenator Enzi serves as the ranking Republican more than 100 Republicanamendments were accepted as part of this debate and still not onesingle Republican Senator would vote for the bill in that committeeSo far the scorecard on Republican participation in health carereform debate is a lot of speeches a lot of press releases a lot ofcharts on the floor but only two votesone from a RepublicanCongressman in Louisiana for the House bill one from Senator Snowe ofMaine for the Senate Finance version of this billThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The time of the majority hasexpired I urge my colleagues to join us in acooperative effort to try to come up with something more positive thanjust our lonely speeches on the floorThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The time of the Senator hasexpired The Senator from Arizona is recognized  President I ask unanimous consent morning businessbe closed I wish to make sure Senator MCCain has time  First those who are watching this is perilously closeto a debate on the floor of the Senate which rarely occurs in theworlds most deliberative body where Senators with opposing viewsactually in a respectful way have an exchange I thank the Senator  Will the Senator yield for a questionMr DeMINT No I wont It reveals to you the true motives of themajority If we look at this bill and this eventual health care billif we ever have time to see it before they try to pass itwe arebeginning to see a real glimpse a true picture of where thisDemocratic majority is goingFinally this bill increases funding for title X family planningservices of which Planned Parenthood is the largest recipient PlannedParenthood is the Nations largest provider of abortions Increasinglythey are what we call directed abortions When people come to PlannedParenthood and look for advice on family planning they are more oftenthan not encouraged and pushed toward abortionAll around this bill you see what is going on It is a major changein policynot to make abortion available but to make Americans pay forit and to promote itI along with 34 of my colleagues in the Senate signed and sent aletter to the majority leader regarding the troubling antilifepolicies in this omnibus bill Collectively we vowed to speak out toprotect the longstanding Federal funding limitations on abortionabelief that has enjoyed broad bipartisan support for many yearsFor this reason as well as a number of other values issues that areirresponsibly addressed in this legislation I support Senator MCCainto raise a point of order against the omnibus under rule XXVIII of theStanding Rules of the Senate I urge my colleagues to do the sameI remind my colleagues that a vote against the MCCain point of orderis a vote to force American taxpayers to promote and pay for abortionsIt is plain and simple I am sure there will be a lot of smoke andmirrors after my talk that will try to convince you that is not trueBut it is in the legislation and it will happen We need to stop itI thank the Chair and yield the floor President I hope the Senator from South Carolinawont leave He would not yield for a question I want to address hisremarks and some of them are not accurate I dont want him to feelthat I am saying this outside of his presenceI ask the Senator from South Carolina while he has a few minutes ifhe could look in the bill and find the provision in the bill that killsthe DC Opportunity Scholarship Program Please present it to me nowbecause it is not there It is not thereThe DC Opportunity Scholarship Program is a voucher program createdmore than 5 years ago It was authorized through the AppropriationsCommittee not through formal authorization As many as 1700 studentsin DC ended up going to school and getting about 7500 a year to helppay the tuition for their schools The program has diminished in sizeI will concede thateven though I tried in a debate and negotiationsto change that It is down to about 1300 students It is funded inthis bill to the tune of 132 millionSo for the Senator from South Carolina to stand up and say as hedid that this program is killed how does he explain the 132 millionin the billMr DeMINT If the Senator will yield the President has said he isgoing to end this program Does this bill end itMr DeMINT I will come to the floor to explain the technical aspectsof why it is not Explain all the technicalaspects you would like but the fact is that 132 million goes to theDC Opportunity Scholarship Program And the 1300 students currently inthe program will be protected and will receive the tuitiona grant of7500 per studentin the coming year That is a fact To stand thereand say otherwise is wrongMr DeMINT You grandfather it inif the Senator will yield for aquestion does this bill fund the continuation of the program beyondthe 1300 who are already in itMr DeMINT It kills the program then If they are whyMr DeMINT But the program will not continue What happens is this program nextyear will be up going through the Senate and the House ofRepresentatives For the Senator from South Carolina to misrepresentthe contents of the bill is not fairSecondly this idea of government funding abortion let me say to theSenator from South Carolina here are the basic pillars on thiscontroversial issue in America First the Supreme Court has saidabortion is a legal procedure in Roe v WadeSecond Congress said through the Hyde amendment that we will spendno Federal funds for abortion except in cases involving the life of themother rape and incestThird Congress said any providerhospital doctor medicalprofessionalwho in good conscience cannot participate in an abortionprocedure will never be compelled to do soThis bill doesnt change that at all In the Senators State of SouthCarolina and in my State of Illinois the leadership of the StatestheGovernor and the legislaturedecide what they will spend their Statefunds on That is done in States across the United States SeventeenStates have decided they will have State funds pay for abortions beyondthe Hyde amendment It is their States decision not our decision inDC We in this bill give them the same authority that the State ofSouth Carolina has and the State of Illinois has No Federal funds fromthe government from Congress can be spent on this exercise or use offunds for abortions beyond the Hyde amendment But if they choose touse their own fundsjust as South Carolina and Illinois make theirchoicethen they make that decisionMany in Congress have a secret yearning to be mayors of the Districtof Columbia They want to be on the city councilnot just in theSenate They want to make every finite decision for the 500000 or600000 people who live hereMr DeMINT Will the Senator yield The people wholive here in DC are taxpaying citizens They pay their taxes and theyvote for President They send their young men and women off to war justlike every State in the Union I think they are entitled to some of thebasic rights we enjoy in each of our own StatesI also want to say a word about the needle exchange program I getnervous around needles I dont like to run in to the doctor and saygive me another shot So taking an issue like this on is not a lot offun to start with Why are we talking about needle exchange programs inthe District of Columbia For one simple reason The HIVAIDS infectionrate in the District of Columbia Washington DC the Nations Capitalis the highest in the Nation We are living in a city with the highestincidence of needlerelated HIVAIDS and meningitis and other thingsthat follow A needle exchange program says to those who are addictedCome to a place where they can at least put you in touch with someonewho can counsel you and help move you off your addiction and they willgive you a clean needle instead of a dirty one I hate it and I wishwe didnt need it I dont like it But in States across the Nationthey make the decision that this is the humane and thoughtful thing todo to finally bring addicts in before they infect other people andspread this epidemicThe doctors are the ones who tell us this works States make thedecisions on it I think the District of Columbia facing the highestincidence of infection from HIVAIDS should also make that samedecision in terms of the money they spend The provision that came overfrom the House of Representatives would have limited the distributionof this program to virtually a handful of places in DC We said that DCcan make the rules about where the safe places are for these needleexchange programsAs I said I hate to even consider the prospect but I cannot blindmyself tothe reality that we have this high incidence of infection in theDistrict of Columbia and the medical professionals tell us this isworking We are bringing addicts in We are bringing them into a safersituation We are counseling some of them beyond their addiction Weare saving livesAm I supposed to turn my back on that and say I am sorry it offendsme to think of this concept It offends me to think of people dyingneedlessly and that is why we have this programLet me say a word about the DC Public Schools I did not ask to takethis DC appropriations bill on This is not something I ran for in theHouse of Representatives or the Senate But it is part of myresponsibility This is a great city with great problems but there aresome shining lights on the horizon and one of them is Michelle Rheechancellor of the public school system in the District of ColumbiaMichelle is an amazing story of a young woman attending CornellUniversity She decided when she graduated to sign up for one of thetop employers of college graduates in America today Teach for AmericaShe went off and taught in Baltimore She took a hopeless classroomsituation and in 2 years turned it around Kids from the neighborhoodhad test scores nobody dreamed of because of Michelles skill Sheworked in New York bringing nontraditional teachers into the teachingsituation and then was asked to be chancellor hereShe is working on an overall reform for the DC Public Schools whichI endorse It is a reform which will move us toward pay forperformance where those teachers who do a good job and improve testscores are rewarded It is a voluntary program for teachers Theresults are starting to show This week in the District of Columbiathey reported math scores that showed dramatic improvements compared tocities around the NationShe has another responsibility while 45000 kids are in the publicschools of DC 28000 are enrolled in public but independent charterschools The charter schools have to match the performance of thepublic schools or improve upon them It is the same for the voucherschools the DC opportunity scholarshipsThe Senator from South Carolina stands before us to say I eliminatethe program Where does that 132 million go It goes to the programthe DC opportunity scholarships I did change the program I changedthe program because I failed initially when I offered amendmentsHere are some of the changes I made and you be the judge as towhether these are unreasonable changesI said for the voucher schoolshalf of them are Catholic schoolsIsaid for the voucher schools every teacher in basic core subjects hasto have a college degree How about that for a radical idea a teacherwith a college degree It is now required It was not beforeSecond the buildings they teach inthese DC voucher schools have topass the fire safety code Is that a radical idea killing the programIf it means closing a school that is dangerous sure I would closethat school in a second before I would send my child or grandchildthereThird we said if you attend a DC voucher school the students therehave to take the same tests as the DC Public Schools so we can comparehow you are doing If you take a different test you have differentresults We are never going to have a true comparisonI also added in here at the suggestion of Senator Lamar Alexander ofTennessee a former Secretary of Education that each of the DC voucherschools either has to be accredited or seeking accreditation I dontthink that is radical I dont think it closes a programThe final thing I say is the people who administer this program haveto actually physically visit the school at least twice a year We had ahearing where the administrator of the program was shown pictures ofsome of these DC voucher schools and frankly he said We have notbeen there Maybe once a year we get by It has to be more than thatWe have to make sure these schools are functioning and operating Weare sending millions of Federal dollars into them We expect it atpublic schools we expect it at charter schools Should we not ask thesame of the DC voucher schoolsI say this at least those in the Archdiocese of Washington agreed tothese things and have said For our Catholic schools we are ready tomeet these standards and tests My hat is off to them It is achallenge I am sure but it is one I think they will meet I want themto continue to do thatI did try to expand this program in one aspect in the course of ournegotiations with Senator Collins assistance so siblings would beallowed to attend this program I think it would be helpful We werenot successful There are those opposed to this altogetherI say the Senator from South Carolina has mischaracterized the DCvoucher program He has not fully explained that we have not changedthe Hyde amendment which prohibits Federal funds for abortionpurposes other than strict narrow categories He went on to saysomething about the needle exchange program which does not reflect thereality and the gravity of the health crisis facing the District ofColumbiaThis is not a radical bill This is a bill which I think is in themainstream of America It is a bill consistent with the same laws thatapply in his State of South Carolina and my State of Illinois and mostother States across the NationI wish we were not in this paternalistic position in relation to theDistrict of Columbia I would rather this city had home rule had itsown Members of Congress could make its own decisions That is my goalI would like to see that happen In the meantime I think we shouldtreat the people who live here fairly give them a chance to deal withtheir significant problems acknowledge success as we just reported inthe public schools and try to help them where we canThis is in fact a great city and the capital of a great nation Ithink the mayor does a good jobI reserve the remainder of my time  I would say to the Senator from Arizona I went throughbankruptcy reform with Senator Grassley and a similar process wasfollowed when the Republicans were in the majority He produced thebaseline bill and I made some modifications and ultimately at onepoint in time we agreed on a bill came up with a common bill Thestarting point is just that a starting point But I say to the Senatorfrom Arizona look at what happened to the issue of public option Ibelieve in public option passionately I believe it is essential forthe future of health care reform for competition for private healthinsurance companies to give consumers a choice to make sure we haveone lowcost alternative at least in every market Yet at the end ofthe day I did not get what I wanted and what is being proposed now atthe Congressional Budget Office is not my version of public optionWe ended up bending toward some of the more moderate and conservativemembers of the Democratic caucus and toward the Republican point ofview I dont know of a single Republican who came out for publicoption Maybe I am forgetting one At the end of the day the point Iam making to the Senator is there was an effort at flexibility and aneffort at change to try to find some common ground Unfortunately theground we are plowing has only 60 Democratic votes It could have beenmuch different It could still be much different  But I add SenatorSnowe has shown I believe extraordinary courage in voting for thisbill in the Senate Finance Committee and made it clear she could notsupport the public option We are hoping at the end of the day shewill consider voting for health care reform That was part of thecalculation  I understand your point of view but I would sayyou areright But we were moving toward our 60 votes but it would be a greatoutcome if we end up with a bill that brings some Republicans on boardand it was clear we couldnt achieve that if we kept the public optionin There are other elements here We are going to have a real profounddifference when it comes to the issue of medical malpractice and how toapproach it But I think even on that issue we could have workedtoward some common ground and I hope someday we still can  I would say to the Senator from Arizona I am in the darkalmost as much as he is and I am in the leadership The reason isbecause the Congressional Budget Office which scores the managersamendment the socalled compromise has told us once you publiclystart debating it we will publicly release it We want to basicallysee whether it works whether it works to continue to reduce thedeficit whether it works to continue to reduce the growth in healthcare costsWe had a caucus after this was submitted to the Congressional BudgetOffice where Senator Reid and other Senators who were involved in itbasically stood and said We are sorry we cant tell you in detailwhat was involved But you will learn everyone will learn it will beas public information as this bill currently is on the Internet Butthe Congressional Budget Office has tied our hands at this pointputting it forward Basically what I know is what you know havingread press accounts of what may be included  Same time same place tomorrow  I think the Senator is correct saying most of us knowthefundamentals but we do not know the important details behind thisWhat I am saying is this is not the choice of the majority leader Itis the choice of the Congressional Budget Office We may find thatsomething that was sent over there doesnt work at all doesnt flyThey may say this is not going to work start over So we have toreserve the right to do that and I think that is why we are waitingfor the Congressional Budget Office scoring as they call it to makesure it hits the levels we want in terms of deficit reduction andreducing the cost of health careIt is frustrating on your side It is frustrating here But I amhoping in a matter of hours maybe days we will receive the CBOreportI would like to ask the Senator from Arizona if he wouldnt mindresponding to me on this Does the Senator believe the current healthcare system in America is sustainable as we know it in terms ofaffordability for individuals and businesses Is the Senator concernedthat more and more people do not have the protection of healthinsurance fewer businesses offer that protectionThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The 10minute time period hasexpired  Is the Senator concerned as well with the fact that wehave 50 million Americans without health insurance and the number isgrowing that in many of the insurance markets across America there isno competition one or two takeitorleaveit situations Does thatlead him to conclude we cannot stay with the current system but have tomake some fundamental changes and reforms  First the CBOtells us this bill will make Medicare live 5 years more This bill willbreathe into Medicare extended life of 5 additional years Second Ihave heard a lot of negative comments about governmentsponsored healthcare I ask the Senator from Arizona is he in favor of eliminating theMedicare Program the veterans care program the Medicaid Program theCHIP program to provide health insurance for children all basicallygovernmentadministered programs Does he believe there is somethingfundamentally wrong with those programs that they should be jettisonedand turned over to the private sectorThe second question does the Senator from Arizona want to justifywhy Medicare Advantage offered by private health insurance companiescosts 14 percent more than the government plan being offered and weare literally subsidizing private health insurance companies to thetune of billions of dollars each year so they can make more profits atthe expense of Medicare  If I may respond why is Medicare facing insolvency Whyis it going broke Why are the other systems facing it Because theincrease in cost in health care each year outstrips inflation There isno way to keep up with it unless we start bending the cost curve Weface that reality unless we deal with the fundamentals of how to havemore efficient quality health care Going broke is a phenomena notreflective in bad administration of the program but in the reality ofhealth care economicsWhat I am about to say about the expanded Medicare is based solely onpress accounts not that I know what was submitted to CBO in detail Ido not But the 55 to 64 eligibility for Medicare will be in a separatepool sustained by premiums paid by those going in If they are a highrisk pool by nature they will see higher premiums What happens inthat pool will not have an impact on Medicare as I understand it Itwill be a separate pool of those receiving Medicare benefits that theywill pay for in actual premiums It wont be at the expense or to thebenefit of the Medicare Program itself What I have said is based onpress accounts and not my personal knowledge of what was submitted toCBO 
S_IA_GRASSLEY,2009-12-11, President I had a chance to listen to my goodfriend the Senator from Illinois his remarks about why the billbefore the Senate is going to reduce costs and pay down on the nationaldebt Now that is the Senator from Illinois I am the Senator fromIowa But I would like to not refer to my judgment about this billright now What I would like to refer to is the judgment outlined in areport that was issued today from the Chief Actuary of the Centers forMedicare  Medicaid Services in the Department of Health and HumanServices a professional person who calls it like it is That is hisresponsibilityRemember I am quoting from a report that was just given today aboutthis 2074page bill we have before us and that my friend fromIllinois was just speaking very favorably about So I am going to talkabout somebody in the executive branch of government under thePresident of the United States who says this about this reform billthat it will cost more than the status quo The Chief Actuary of theCenters for Medicare  Medicaid Services issued a report on SenatorReids bill which shows that health care costs would go up not downunder his bill The Chief Actuary warned that the Democrats healthcare bill would increase health care costs threaten access to care forseniors and force people off their current coverageIn other words the administrations own Chief Actuary conclusivelydemonstrates that the Democrats rhetoric does not match the reality ofthe bill The cost curve would bend up not down National healthexpenditures would increase from 16 percent of GDP to 209 percentunder the Reid bill The Chief Actuary concluded that the FederalGovernment and the country would spend 234 billion more under the billthan without it The Chief Actuary also says that the billjeopardizes access to care for beneficiaries because of the billssevere cuts in MedicareQuoting the Chief ActuaryProviders for whom Medicare constitutes a substantiveportion of their business could find it difficult to remainprofitable and    might end their participation in theprogram possibly jeopardizing access to care forbeneficiariesThen it speaks about the savings in the bill being unrealistic TheActuary says that many of the Medicare cuts are unrelated to theproviders costs of furnishing services to beneficiaries It istherefore doubtful that providers could reduce costs to keep upwith the cutsThen the Chief Actuary speaks about new taxes costing consumers 11billion per year The new taxes in the Reid bill would increase drugand device prices and health insurance premiums for consumers TheActuary estimates this would increase costs on consumers by 11 billionper year beginning in 2011that is 3 years before most benefits kickinThen the Actuary speaks about health care shortages that thesehealth care shortages are plausible and even probable particularlyfor Medicare and Medicare beneficiaries Because of the increaseddemand for health care the Actuary says that accesstocare problemsagain these words plausible and even probable under the Reidbill The access problems will be the worst for seniors on Medicare andlowincome people on Medicaid The Actuary says providers might tendto accept more patients who have private insurance with relativelyattractive payment rates and fewer Medicare and Medicaid patientsexacerbating existing access problems for the latter groupPremiums for the governmentrun plan would actually be higher thanunder private plans Agreeing with the Congressional Budget Office theChief Actuary said that because the government plan would not encouragehighervalue health care and it would attract sicker people premiums for thegovernmentrun plan would be 4 percent higher than for the privateinsurersThen there is a point about employers dropping coverage The ChiefActuary concluded that 17 million people will lose their employersponsored coverage Many smaller employers would be inclined toterminate their existing coverage so their workers could qualify forheavily subsidized coverage through the exchangeThen it speaks lastly about the longterm health care part of thisbill called the CLASS Act The CLASS Act stands for Community LivingAssistance Services and Support CLASSThe Chief Actuary has determined that the CLASS Act longterm careinsurance program faces a significant risk of failure because thehigh costs will attract sicker people and lead to low participationEven though premiums would be 240 a month the policy would result ina net Federal cost in the long termI think quoting the Chief Actuary is a very good way to bringattention to the shortcomings that on this side of the aisle we havetried to discuss about the 2074page bill Members on this side of theaisle have shown that the Reid bill will bend the health spending curvethe wrong way over the next year and that the Reid bill cuts Medicareby 12 trillion and jeopardizes seniors access to care So againquoting from the Health and Human Services Chief Actuarys analysisconfirms the dangerous consequences of the 2074page Reid billI would like to highlight some of the findings in a more encompassingway than I just did quoting the Chief ActuaryFirst contrary to what Members on the other side of the aisle claimthe Chief Actuarys report confirms that the Reid bill bends the costcurve the wrong way According to the HHS Chief Actuary over the next10 yearsand this chart highlights ittotal national healthexpenditures under this bill would increase by an estimated total of234 billion And a good portion of the increase in national healthexpenditures would be caused by the socalled fees in this bill onmedical devices and on prescription drugs and on health insurancepremiumsHere we have a chart where the Chief Actuary found that    feeswould    be passed through to health consumers in the form of higherdrug and device prices and higher insurance premiums    This wouldresult in    an associated increase of approximately 11 billionper year in overall national health expenditures This refutes claimsfrom the other side that the socalled fees wont be passed on toconsumers And this analysis clearly refutes claims from the other sidethat the Reid bill saves moneyNext the Chief Actuary also confirms that the Reid bill jeopardizesbeneficiary access to care The Chief Actuary tallied up around 493billion in net Medicare cuts and he raised concerns in particularabout two categories of these Medicare cutsFirst the report warns about the permanent productivity adjustmentsto annual payment updates These productivity adjustmentsautomatically cut annual Medicare payment updates based onproductivity measures for the entire economy not just for thatsection of health care part of the economyThe Chief Actuary confirms that these permanent cuts would threatenaccess to care Referring to these cuts he wrote that    theestimated savings    may be unrealistic and    possiblyjeopardizing access to care for beneficiariesIt is doubtful that many could improve their own productivity tothe end achieved by the economy at large This is a direct quote fromthe Chief Actuarys report He goes on to say We are not aware ofany empirical evidence demonstrating the medical communitys ability toachieve productivity improvements equal to those of the overalleconomyIn other words basically he is saying this If you are going to makea judgment that you are going to cut health care costs and thatproductivity has to be measured by the entire economy you cant takethe entire economy and apply it to a small segment of the economyhealth careand expect it to be fair and expect that small segment ofthe economy to be as productive and equal the productivity of theentire US economyYou have to listen to these people who are professionals in theseareas The Chief Actuary is a professional In fact the ChiefActuarys conclusion is that it would be difficult for providers toeven remain profitable over time as Medicare payments fail to keep upwith the cost of caring for beneficiariesReferring to this chart ultimately here is the Chief Actuarysconclusion that providers who rely on Medicare might end theirparticipation in Medicare    possibly jeopardizing access to carefor beneficiaries That is right out of the Chief Actuarys reportis where that quote comes fromHe even has numbers to back up these statements His office ransimulations of the effect of these drastic and permanent cuts Here wehave the quote Based on the simulations the Chief Actuary found thatduring the first 10 years    20 percent of Medicare Part Aproviders would become unprofitable    as a result of productivityadjustmentsThis is going to be horrible on rural America where we already havedifficult times recruiting doctors and keeping our hospitals open As Isaid it is difficult to keep up with these productivity adjustments byour providers It is for this reason that the Actuary found thatreductions in payment updates    based on economywideproductivity gains are unlikely to be sustainable on a permanentannual basis That is right out of the report of the ActuaryThe second category of Medicare cuts the Chief Actuary raisesconcerns about would be imposed by the new independent Medicareadvisory board created in this 2074page bill This new body ofunelected officials would have broad authority to make even furthercuts in Medicare These additional cuts in Medicare would be driven byarbitrary cost growth targets based on a blend of general economicgrowth and medical inflation This board would have the authority toimpose further automatic Medicare cuts even absent any congressionalactionThe Chief Actuary gives a reality check to this proposal He showshow tall an order the Reid bills target for health care cost growthactually isAgain quoting the ActuaryLimiting cost growth to a level below medical priceinflation would represent an exceedingly difficult challengeHe points out in this analysis that Medicare cost growth was belowthis target in only 4 of the last 25 years Just thinkwhat this2074page bill is trying to accomplish is something that has beenaccomplished in only 4 out of the last 25 yearsThe Actuary also points out that the backroom deals that carved outcertain types of providers would complicate this boards effort to cutMedicare So to this analysisThe necessary savings would have to be achieved primarilythrough changes affecting physician services MedicareAdvantage payments and Part DSo providers such as hospitals will escape from this boards cut atthe expense of doctors Medicare Advantage plans and higher premiumsimposed on beneficiaries for their Medicare drug coverage Part D ofMedicare If we survey the Nations seniors I doubt very much theywould say that raising their premiums for Medicare drug coverage iswhat they would call health care reformThis board which can cut reimbursements is guaranteed to have toimpose these additional Medicare cuts In other words they can do itAccording to the Chief Actuarys analysis of the Medicare cuts in theReid bill even though the Medicare cuts already in the Reid bill arequite substantial they wouldthe savings would not besufficient to meet the growth rate targets This means the board willbe required by law to impose even more Medicare cuts in addition tothe massive Medicare cuts already in the billThis bill imposes a 212 trillion tab on Americans It kills jobswith taxes and fees that go into effect 4 years before the reforms kickinIt kills jobs with an employer mandate It imposes 12 trillion inhigher taxes on premiums on medical devices on prescription drugs andmore It jeopardizes access to care with massiveMedicare cuts It imposes higher costs It raises premiums It bendsthe growth curve the wrong way in other words up instead of downThis is not what people have in mind when they think about health carereformThere is another aspect to this bill that I wish to go over I hopethe third time is the charm I hope this time the other side of theaisle will understand that the Reid bill increases taxes on middleincome families individuals and single parents That is becausecontrary to the claims made by the other side of the aisle the Reidbill clearly raises taxes on middleincome Americans We have data notfrom this Senator but as I quoted previously the expertise of theChief Actuary I want to quote the expertise now of the Joint Committeeon Taxation professionals who are blind to politics who judge thingsand call them like they see them Yesterday I pointed out how the sameJoint Committee on Taxation data led my Democratic friends to proclaimthat the Reid bill provided a net tax cut to all Americans We havethis distribution chart I used previously to show that that net reallyis not netThere is no question that the bill does provide a tax benefit to agroup of Americans a relatively small group A much larger grouphowever will see their taxes go up Most if not all in this groupwill not benefit from the government subsidy for health insurance Thatis part of this 2074page bill As a result the generous subsidy thatis in that bill that is going to a small group of Americans cannot beused by this larger group to offset their increased tax liabilitiesThe other side however wants to spread the large tax benefit that isgoing to this small group of Americans to everybody in other wordsall Americans even among those Americans who are not eligible toreceive the subsidy and then somehow claim that all Americans arereceiving a tax cut How can a person receive a tax cut if they are notreceiving some type of tax benefitYes the data shows that some will receive a benefit but the dataalso shows that the others will see a tax increase I have highlightedin yellow these various figures individuals and families who will seea tax increase In general these individuals and families are notreceiving the subsidy for health insurance This means they have nogovernment benefit to offset their new tax liability The mostimportant point I want to makefor the third timeis that these taxincreases fall on individuals making more than 50000 and familiesmaking more than 75000 Again I highlighted this group on the JointCommittee on Taxation chartThe Joint Committee distributed in this chart three separate taxprovisions the highcost plan tax the medical expense deductionlimitation and the Medicare payroll tax Among these tax provisionsthe highcost plan tax seems to be garnering the most attention andalso tremendous opposition I dont have to explain who the opponentsof this tax increase are Everybody knows In fact yesterday I hadrepresentatives of the Iowa Education Association the teachers ofIowa saying they are against that high plan tax because it is going tohurt Iowa teachers So if this provision the highcost plan tax wereto drop out of the Reid bill for one reason or anotherand this billis still being written in secret or at least changes in this 2074pagebill are being written in secret so who knows what is going to happento this highly controversial thingif it is taken out some Membersmay feel they have successfully shielded the middle class from a taxincrease Unfortunately for those Members who may be hopeful of thislesser known tax provisions that are likely to stay in the changes thatcome through the Democratic health care reform product would stillraise taxes on the middle classAgain dont take my word for it The Joint Committee on Taxationtells us so Specifically that committee sent a letter to SenatorCrapo stating that tax provisions such as the cap on flexible savingsaccounts the elimination of tax reimbursements for overthecountermedicines and most importantly the individual mandate excise taxpenalty will increase taxes on people making less than 250000 Thathappens to be middleclass individual middleclass families andmiddleclass single parentsI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record that letterThere being no objection the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record as followsCongress of the United StatesJoint Committee on TaxationWashington DC December 9 2009Hon Mike CrapoUS

incidence on individuals including some itemsthat do not have statutory incidence We are enclosing a copyof that distributional analysis for reference Included inthe distribution table are the following items that wouldhave statutory incidence as well as economic incidence onindividuals and are likely to increase tax liabilities forsome taxpayers with AGI below 200000 250000 in the caseof a joint return1 Raise the 75 percent AGI floor on medical expensesdeduction to 10 percent and2 Additional 05 percent hospital insurance tax on wagesin excess of 200000 250000 jointYou asked us to enumerate items that we have not previouslydistributed and that we believe could affect the taxliability of taxpayers with AGI below 200000 250000 inthe case of a joint return Below is a list of theprovisions that we have not previously distributed and thathave statutory incidence on individuals with some of thoseindividuals likely to have income below your threshold1 Conform definition of medical expenses for healthsavings accounts Archer MSAs health flexible spendingarrangements and health reimbursement arrangements2 Increase the penalty for nonqualified health savingsaccount distributions to 20 percent3 Limit health flexible spending arrangements in cafeteriaplans to 25004 Impose a fivepercent excise tax on cosmetic surgery andsimilar procedures and5 Impose an individual mandate penaltyI hope this information is helpful to you If we can be offurther assistance in this matter please let me knowSincerelyThomas A BartholdEnclosureGRAPHIC TIFF OMITTED TS11DE09001GRAPHIC TIFF OMITTED TS11DE09002 In closing let me turn to one more chart the Joint TaxCommittee has provided This chart shows the effect on the medicalexpense deduction limitation This tax increase is just one of the manytax increases likely to stay in the new Democratic proposal On thischart which is for the year 2019 because that is when this bill isfully implemented we see positive dollar figures I have highlightedthese dollar figures in yellow For those who may not be able to see Iwill reiterate that this chart only has positive dollar figures on itBut remember as I explained yesterday when we see positive dollarfigures from the Joint Committee on Taxation that committee is tellingus that taxes for these people are going to go up That means for allof the tax returns listed on this chart taxes will be going up foreach And this tax increase the medical expense deduction limitationreaches as low as someone making 10000 a yearMaybe some of these lowincome individuals and families who will seea tax increase under this provision will receive a subsidy for healthinsurance These people may be able to offset this new tax liabilityBut you can bet your bottom dollar that a large portion of the middleincome individuals and families are not receiving a subsidy This meansthat this tax liability highlighted in yellow cannot be offset by thegovernment benefitMy Democratic friends cannot escape that fact Even if my friendsdrop some of the tax provisions in the current Reid bill many taxprovisions will most likely remain And those tax provisions willincrease taxes on middleclass Americans This not only breaksPresident Obamas pledge but it will arbitrarily burden middleclassAmericans for years to comeI yield the floorThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Udall of Colorado The Senator from NewJersey
S_MT_BAUCUS,2009-12-08, Atleast indirectly it is our understanding that Senator Reid will sooncome to the floor to speak   Madam President with respect to the last debate letsbe clear that the underlying bill keeps the threedecadesold agreementthat has implemented the Hyde amendment to separate Federal funds fromprivate funds when it comes to reproductive health careThe NelsonHatch amendment is unnecessary It is discriminatoryagainst women Women are the only group of people who are told how touse their own private money That is unfairOn another matter with respect to the MCCain motion let me explaina little bit about Medicare Advantage and how it works Essentiallythe Medicare Advantage Programs are insurance companies They areinsurance companies that have their own officers directors their ownmarketing plans and their own administrative costs and they areconcerned about the rate of return on investment for theirstockholders These are simple garden variety ordinary insurancecompaniesIn this case they are insurance companies that get general revenuefrom payroll taxes and premiums They are basically insurance companiesthat give benefits to senior citizens These insurance companies areoverpaid There is not much disagreement that they are overpaid Howare they paid Well believe it or not these insurance companiesMedicare Advantage plansare paid according to the amount Congresssets in statute That is their payment rate what Congress sets instatuteThe problem is by doing so these preset rates overstate the actualcost of providing care by 30 percent We pay more than it costs toprovide care by about 30 percent in many cases These overpaymentsalso clearly promote inefficiencies in Medicare Also these paymentshave not been proven to increase the quality of care seniors receiveIn the estimate I saw about half the Medicare Advantage plans havecare coordination and half dont Half are no better than ordinary feeforservice plans Because of this broken irrational payment systemsome plans receive more than 200 per enrollee per month and othersreceive about 36 per enrollee per monthAgain the payment rates are set by statute relating to fee forservice in the area It is broken It doesnt make sense It causesgreat dislocations and differences in the payment rates Frankly underthis broken system all beneficiaries are not receiving the same careI believe all beneficiaries should be able to have access to the bestcare not just those who happen to live in States with high paymentrates Madam President I ask unanimous consent to continue foran additional 5 minutes Madam President I have said these Medicare Advantageplans are overpaid Nobody disagrees with that They are overpaid TheSenator from Oklahoma Mr Coburn when I asked him a few days ago ifhe thought they were overpaid said Yes they are overpaid The MedPACadvisory board tells us Yes they are overpaidHere is a statement made by Tom Scully former Administrator of theCenter for Medicare and Medicaid ServicesI think Congress should take some of it away Theres beenhuge overfundingThere are lots of other citations from Wall Street analysts andothers in the industry saying clearly the Medicare Advantage plans areoverpaid Frankly we in Congress put a statutory provision in lawthat has caused this overpayment Clearly we should fix itIn addition something that is pretty alarming is according to astudy I saw only about 14 cents on the dollar of extra payments toMedicare Advantage plans goes to beneficiariesonly 14 centswhichmeans 86 cents on the dollar goes to the company not to thebeneficiaries not to the enrollees but to the companiesthecompanies meaning the officers directors administrative costsmarketing costs rate of return It is to the company any ordinarygarden variety company Therefore it behooves us to find a better wayto pay Medicare Advantage companies so it is efficient there is notwaste and payments go primarily to enrollees to beneficiariesHow do we do that This legislation moves away from the currentarchaic system which sets statutory amounts in effect Rather we sayOK why not have these companies bid Let them compete based on costsin their regions One region of the country is different from anotherregion of the country We are going to say what is fair here to get ridof a lot of waste and overpayments is provide that Medicare Advantageplans can compete in their area based on costThe plan will be paid the average bids that are based on competitionin the area We the authors of this bill think that is a far betterway of paying for Medicare AdvantageWill that reduce payments to beneficiaries Certainly no Allguaranteed benefits are guaranteed in this legislation In fact I amgoing to check up on another statistic I heard somewhere under thislegislation there will be an increase of enrolleesnot a decrease anincrease of enrollees I am going to track that down because I want tobe sure I am accurateI will conclude I want to talk more about this issue later Theremay be a separate amendment on this subject offered on our side By andlarge it is wrong to continue a current system that dramaticallyoverpays and where 86 percent of the overpayment goes to the companyand only 14 cents goes to the beneficiaries We have to come up with afair way of paying Medicare Advantage I think a fair way is to havethe companies competitively bid based on cost in their areas That waythey are going to get reimbursed at a level that is relevant to theirarea and it is also relative to the cost they incur when they runtheir plans I will have more to say about that laterI yield the floor  President I ask unanimous consent that the Senatorfrom Nebraska be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes  President for the benefit of all Senators I wouldlike to take a moment to lay out todays program It has been more than212 weeks since the majority leader moved to proceed to the healthcare reform bill and this is the ninth day of debate The Senate hasconsidered 18 amendments or motions We have conducted 14 rollcallvotesToday the Senate will debate the amendment by the Senator fromNebraska Mr Nelson on a womans right to choose At the same timewe will debate the motion by Senator MCCain on Medicare AdvantageThe time between now and the caucus lunches is for debate only Themajority will control the first hour of debate this morning theRepublicans will control the second hourWe are hopeful the Senate will be able to conduct votes on or inrelation to the Nelson amendment a sidebyside amendment to theMCCain motion and the MCCain motion sometime this afternoonThereafter we expect to turn to another Democratic firstdegreeamendment which is likely to be the amendment by the Senator fromNorth Dakota Mr Dorgan on drug reimportation and another Republicanfirstdegree amendment We are working on lining up those amendmentsI note that the pending MCCain motion is the third such effort by theRepublicans to defend the private insurance companies that run theprogram called Medicare Advantage That is the same socalled MedicareAdvantage Program that the nonpartisan MedPAC says is overpaidoverpaid by 14 percentcompared with traditional Medicare which doesthe same thingThat is the same socalled Medicare Advantage Program whoseoverpayments add 90 to the Medicare premiums of a typical retiredcouple even though that couple gets nothing in exchangeThat is the same socalled Medicare Advantage Program that has beenthe major source of strong profits for the private insurance companiesthat receive those overpayments And that is the same socalledMedicare Advantage Program that helps those private insurance companiesto pay their CEOs 8 million a year 9 million a year and in oneinstance more than 20 million a year in compensationSo that is the same socalled Medicare Advantage Program that in ourview needs a healthy dose of competition That is all our bill woulddo Our bill would move to competitive bidding in the private insuranceMedicare market It is high time we did soThis morning we are going to have a colloquy among many new Senatorsthe group of Senators who were just elected last year which is a veryactive group I have met with them many times They are verythoughtful very active and they have a lot to sayThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Connecticut isrecognized  Madam President may I ask unanimous consent to speak fora couple of minutes to comment on the freshman package It will justtake a few minutes Madam President I join my good friend from Connecticutin thankingI dont know if calling them freshmen would be wisebecause our colleagues act as though they have been here for years andknow the subject extremely wellDelivery system reform has always been something I have been pushingfor and I am happy to see it is part of your package and also withadditional emphasis on rural areas and Indian reservations We clearlyneed more of that and more transparency I firmly believe that willhelp us get costs down and get quality of care up Your work on theindependent Medicare advisory board is great tooTo be honest these are all the next steps in ideas that are prettymuch in the bill but they are the proper next steps and the nextsteps I firmly believe should be taken So I compliment you and thankyou very much and I thank my friend from Arizona for allowing me thistime  President the MCCain motion to commit on MedicareAdvantage would keep overpayments in the Medicare Advantage programeven though the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission recommends thatthey be eliminatedThe MCCain motion to commit is a tax on all seniors It wouldmaintain the overpayments to private insurers and require beneficiariesto pay higher Part B premiums The average couple pays 90 per yearjust so insurers can reap greater profits under MedicareThe MCCain amendment is a raid on the Medicare trust fund MAoverpayments take 18 months off the life of the Part A trust fund Andaccording to MedPAC there is no evidence of greater quality of careIn fact MedPAC told Congress this year that only some MA plans areof high quality MedPAC finds that only half of beneficiariesnationwide have access to a plan that Medicare rates above average onoverall plan qualityThe more than 45 million seniors with Medicare deserve better Theydo not deserve to subsidize high profits of private insurers And themore than 11 million Medicare beneficiaries who choose to enroll inprivate plans also deserve better They deserve plans that coordinatecare Most plans today do not They deserve plans that are of highquality Many plans today do notIf Senators want to help beneficiaries they will vote to eliminateoverpayments under Medicare Advantage And they should vote against theMCCain motion  President I ask unanimous consent that the Committeeon Armed Services be authorized to meet during the session of theSenate on December 8 2009 at 130 pm President I ask unanimous consent that the Committeeon Environment and Public Works be authorized to meet during thesession of the Senate on December 8 2009 at 10 am in room 406 of theDirksen Senate Office Building President I ask unanimous consent that the Committeeon Foreign Relations be authorized to meet during the session of theSenate on December 8 2009 at 215 pm President I ask unanimous consent that the SelectCommittee on Intelligence be authorized to meet during the session ofthe Senate on December 8 2009 at 230 pm President I ask unanimous consent that theSubcommittee on Energy be authorized to

S_CA_FEINSTEIN,2009-12-08,  President simply put I believe this amendmentwould be a harsh and unnecessary step back in health coverage forAmerican womenWhat this amendment would do as I read it is to prohibit any healthinsurance plan that accepts a single government subsidy or dollar fromproviding coverage for any abortion no matter how necessary thatprocedure might be for a womans health even if she pays for thecoverage herselfThe proponents of this amendment say their sole aim is to blockgovernment funds from being used to cover abortion but the underlyingbill already does that In the bill before us health plans that opt tocover abortion servicesin cases other than rape incest or when thelife of the mother is at stakemust segregate the premium dollars theyreceive to ensure that only private dollars and not government money isused They argue that segregating funds means nothingyou heard thatand that money is fungible However this method of separating fundsfor separate uses is used in many other areas and there is ampleprecedent for the provisionFor example charitable choice programs allow agencies that promotereligion to receive Federal funds as long as these funds are segregatedfrom religious activities We all know that We see it in program afterprogram If these organizations can successfully segregate theirsources of funding surely health insurance plans can do the sameAdditionally the Secretary of Health and Human Services must certifythat the plan does not use any Federal funding for abortion coveragebased on accounting standards created by the GAOThis amendment would place an unprecedented restriction on a womansright to use her own money to purchase health care coverage that wouldcover abortions Let me give my colleagues one example Recently mystaff met with a bright young married attorney who works for theFederal Government She and her husband desperately wanted to start afamily and were overjoyed to learn she was pregnant Subsequently shelearned the baby she was carrying had anencephaly a birth defectwhereby the majority of the brain does not develop She was told thebaby could not survive outside of the womb She ended the pregnancy butreceived a bill of nearly 9000 Because she is employed by theFederal Government her insurance policy would not cover the procedureHer physician argued that continuing the pregnancy could have resultedin dysfunctional labor and postpartum hemorrhage which can increasethe risk for the mother The physician also warned that thecomplications could be life threateningHowever OMB found that this circumstance did not meet the narrowexception in which a womans life not her health is in danger Thepatient was told The fetal anomaly presented no medical danger toyou despite the admonitions of her physician The best she could dowas to negotiate down the cost to 5000Now this story without question is tragic A very muchwantedpregnancy could not be continued and on top of this loss the familywas left with a substantial unpaid medical bill Health insurance isdesigned to protect patients from incurring catastrophic billsfollowing a catastrophic medical event But if this amendment passesinsured women would lose any coverage included in the underlying billeven if she pays for it herself Why would this body want to do that Icant support thatA womans pregnancy may also exacerbate a health condition that waspreviously under control or a woman may receive a new diagnosis in themiddle of her pregnancy It happens If this amendment passes women inthese circumstances would also learn that their insurance does notcover an abortion In some cases it may be unclear whether the womanshealth problem meets the strict definition of life endangermentThe National Abortion Federation has compiled calls they receive ontheir hotline which are available to women who need assistanceobtaining abortion care Let me give you a few examplesMolly was having kidney problems and was in a great deal of pain Shecouldnt go to work She couldnt provide for her two children Whenshe became pregnant she made the decision to terminate the pregnancyin order to have her kidney removed to begin her recovery She knewcarrying the pregnancy would create additional health problems andwould leave her unable to provide for her familyJamie already had severe health problems when she learned she waspregnant She was a severe diabetic and her low blood sugar levelscaused her to suffer from seizures She was unable to continue herpregnancy but had difficulty affording the procedureAnother was suffering from a serious liver illness when she becamepregnant Doctors were unsure of the cause but she was in a great dealof pain She already had two children She could not care for thembecause of this pain The tests and medications she needed to addressher medical condition were incompatible with pregnancyNone of these women experienced immediate threats to their lives sounder this amendment their circumstances would not meet the narrowexceptions permitted for abortion coverageThis is a problem How can one say we are going to provide insurancebut we dont like one aspect of it We dont want the government to payfor it OK OK But the woman herself cant pay for it That is theextra step that this legislation takesTo this day it is still legal to have an abortion Women in thissituation dont buy insurance for abortion but they buy a policy thatmay cover them married women should something happen in a pregnancyin the third trimester If they find a baby is without a brain she canhave an abortion and it is coveredOne of the problems with this whole debate is everybody seessomething through their own lens They dont see the grief and troubleand morbidity that is out there and the circumstances that drive awoman to decidemarriedshe has to terminate her pregnancy for verygood medical reasons Nobody considers that This is all ideologic andit really deeply bothers meSo I can only tell my colleagues I very much hope this amendment goesdownThank you very much Mr President I yield the floor The motion to lay on the table was agreed to
S_IL_DURBIN,2009-12-03, I think they are from New EnglandPatriots fansI would like to ask the Senator from New Hampshire if he wouldyield if he is familiar with Doug Elmendorf and the CongressionalBudget Office and the letter of November 18 2009 to the majorityleader Harry Reid in relation to the deficit impact of the CLASS Act  So good at it that they are one of the most profitablesectors in the American economy and virtually everybody knows somebodythey work with or someone in their family who has had a bad experiencewith a health insurance company in America That is the reality we arefacing today  Ifthe chair would advise me when I have used that timeI found it interesting as I am sure the Senator from Montana has tolisten to all of the Republican Senators who have come to the floor todefend Medicare I am sure the Senator from Montana has the same memoryI dothat when it was created it was created by the Democratic sideof the aisle with the general opposition of the Republican side of theaisle They said it was socialized medicine too much government andit would fail Now they are coming riding to the rescue of Medicare Wehave a right to be skeptical about the arguments they are makingImagining these Republican Senators defending Medicare is trying toimagine a fish riding a bicycle I cannot put it in my mind But theyare doing it The Senator who sponsored this motion to commit SenatorMCCain just a year ago in the course of his Presidential campaigncalled for eliminating 13 trillion in spending from Medicare andMedicaid Now he comes to the floor and says this bill which wouldreduce costs in Medicare by less than half of that amount over a 10year period of time is irresponsible and the death knell of MedicareWhat is the real story The real story is the Republican side of theaisle is defending the private health insurance companiescompaniesmaking generous profits from Medicare Advantage This is a programoffered by private health insurance companies to replace governmentrunMedicare It turned out in many instances to have failed miserablyIt costs more money because these private health insurance companiesare taking profits out of the Medicare Advantage Program So they havepleaded with the other side of the aisle to come to their rescue Theyhave sent in their best troops on the other side of the aisle headedby the senior Senator from Arizona who has said the first thing I willdo is to protect these private health insurance companies and theirrights to overcharge seniors in Medicare for Medicare AdvantageHe talks about the people now receiving Medicare Advantage who maybe disadvantaged and see a different policy in the future What theSenator from Arizona and others dont dwell on is that everybody underMedicare today pays 90 a year more into Medicare to subsidize theprivate health insurance companies that offer Medicare Advantage Thisis a taxa taxwhich the Senator from Arizona is trying to preserveIt is a tax on Medicare recipientsThe Senator from Arizona was right a year ago We can take an honestlook at Medicare and Medicaid and take money out of the system withoutdisadvantage to the people involvedI want to say to the Senator from Arizona and others that once wehave dispatched his motion to commit he will have a chance to vote forSenator Michael Bennets amendment It could not be clearer It has twoparts It saysrepeating what this bill says it says unequivocallyNo provision in this Senate bill can reduce any Medicarebenefit guaranteed by statuteNext paragraphSavings in Medicare from the bill will go to extend thelife of the Medicare trust fund lower part B premiums orcost sharing expands benefits improves access to providersWe know and the seniors across America know that left unattendedand uncared for Medicare may go broke in just a matter of 7 or 8years This bill before us will extend the life of Medicare for atleast 5 years It will put Medicare on sound footing which every seniorand their families want to have That is why AARP the largestorganization of senior citizens across America has urged Members ofthe Senate in both parties to oppose the MCCain motion to commit Thatis why I stand today with the Senator who is chairman of the FinanceCommittee and say to my Republican friends with their newfound loveaffair with Medicare that they should reject the 60 Plus organizationthis wise counsel they turned to that came up with the idea ofprivatizing Social SecurityHow would you like to have had all your Social Security money in thestock market over the last 2 years Boy there is a great idea Stickwith this 60 Plus group if you like the notion of privatizing SocialSecurity Stick with AARP if you want Medicare to be strong on soundfinancial footingI yield the floor   I would just say it is unfortunate the Senator from NewHampshire has not seen this letter because if he had had anopportunityand it is impossible to read everythingif he had had anopportunity to read that letter I do not think he would have made thespeeches he just made on the floor about the CLASS Act because theCongressional Budget Office tells us that in the first 10 years theCLASS Act will reduce the Federal budget deficit by 725 billion inthe second 10 years by a substantial amount though somewhat less than725 billion and in the third 10 years30 years outit isanticipated it will add to the deficit but in the words of the letterfrom the Congressional Budget Office by a very small amount over thatnext decade   President does the Senator yield the floor  President I ask unanimous consent that the nextamendment in order be one offered by Senator Whitehouse of RhodeIsland which is at the desk that the other matter in order duringtodays session be a Hatch motion to commit regarding MedicareAdvantage that no other amendments or motions to commit be in orderduring todays session and that the time in sequence following thisunanimous consent requestI do not want to disadvantage the Senatorfrom New Hampshire but if it is our turn on this side of the aisle Iwould ask that Senator Whitehouse first be recognized for the purposeof calling up his amendment and then I be recognized next for no morethan 15 minutes and at that point it is my understanding Senator Hatchhas asked for the floor for 1 hour on his motionIf there are any other requests I would be glad to add them to theunanimous consent request at this point  I am going to finish this as soon as I have gone throughmy preliminary work here I also ask unanimous consent that the timeuntil 8 pm this evening be equally divided and controlled betweenSenators Whitehouse and Hatch or their designees that it be in orderduring this time for Members to engage in colloquies as long as thoseMembers entering into the colloquy remain on the floor   President I have listened carefully to the profoundand eloquent statements from my friend and colleague from NewHampshire Senator Judd Gregg He has frequently invoked the name ofthe Ponzi family though I am not personally familiar with them Ibelieve they have had some skeletons in their closet by virtue of thereferences that have been made But I will tell him that what he saidabout the CLASS Act is inaccurateI know that Senator I see is leaving the floor I hope he does notmiss out on this conversation But   Reclaiming the floor I would just say if I understandwhat the Senator said he is concerned that in the year 2040 thisprogram may not work as effectively as we had hoped it would work Itrust in the wisdom of future Members of the Senate and the House ifthat is necessary to modify the programBut it certainly is worthwhile for us to at least reflect on whatthis program is It is a voluntary selffunded insurance fund forlongterm care for American citizens It was one of the visions ofSenator Kennedy as part of health care reform understanding we areliving longer and many times need help in our late years in life and itcan be expensive and deplete a familys savings Senator Kennedy saidLets try to put together a voluntary program where you can pay in andhave in fact longterm care insurance available to you if you needitThe fact that this program is virtually solvent for 30 straight yearsis an indication of the wisdom of that idea and the way it is plannedI might add one other thing We just finished a motion to commit onthe floor relative to Medicare and many of us argued that the billbefore us the bill that represents health care reform in this debateprotects Medicare and guarantees the basic benefits of Medicare Thoseon the other side of the aisle protested and said No it does notWell then Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado offered an amendmentwhich said pointblank and clearly nothing in this bill will in anyway diminish guaranteed Medicare benefits and a surplus generatedhere will be to give a longer life to the existing Medicare ProgramThe Bennet of Colorado amendment passed 100 to nothing so not onlydoes the bill originally protect Medicare the Bennet amendmentrepeated that and all the Republicans voted for it Yet they continueto come to the floor and say We do not believe what we voted for Webelieve this bill is going to hurt MedicareThe same thing is true with the CLASS Act because Senator Whitehousewho was on the floor momentarily came forward and said I will put itin writing We are going to put it in writing that the surplus in theCLASS Act program cannot be used for other purposes and has to be savedand used for the purposes stated here for longterm care insurance Ithink the Whitehouse amendment is likely to get another 100 votesSo every time we address a concern from the Republican side of theaisle and say the bill addresses that concern or a separate amendmentaddresses that concern they protest It is not enough We need more Ithink they protest too muchI would also say I am troubled today as I have been for severalweeks by the position taken from the Republican side of the aisleabout health care reform For about 13 or 14 days this bill in itsentirety has been available to the American people You can find it byGoogling Senate Democrats and it will direct you to our Web siteand you can click on this bill HR 3590 and read it page afterpageall 2074 pages of it That is the way it should beThere was a lot of angst and worry last August in townhall meetingsWell are you going to get this bill sneaked by us Are we going to geta chance to read it Everybody has a chance to read it But then Iwould recommend to those who are searching the Internet to read healthcare reform bills that if you want to find the Republican health carereform bill look for Senate Republicans and go to their Web siteand you will be able to click on health care reform bill and youwill find the Democratic health care reform bill becauseunfortunately there is no Republican health care reform bill Theyhave not offered one They have had a year to prepareit They have had plenty of ideas they have expressed on the floorThey have been critical of our efforts They have offered literallyhundreds of amendments in committee and yet they cannot come up with abillIt leads you to conclude this is not an easy task It is not easy atall It certainly is not easy to produce a bill such as this one theDemocratic bill which generates over the first 10 years a 130billion Federal surplus in our Treasury This bill adds more in termsof surplus and deficit reduction than any bill in the history of theSenate In the second 10 years the Congressional Budget Office saysthere will be another 650 billion in savings on our deficitSo for those who argue if we pass this bill we are going deeper indebt they ignore the Congressional Budget Office that referee thattakes a look at all the bills and tells us that over the span of 20years we are going to reduce our deficit by some 700 billion or 800billion just by virtue of this bill Republicans have been unable toproduce a bill that reduces the deficit when it comes to health careby a penny They come here and criticize what we have done but theycant produce a bill All the great legislative minds on their side ofthe aisle and we have been waiting patiently for them to produce ahealth care reform bill They cant or they dont want to Maybe theylike the current health care system Maybe they think this is the wayAmerica should beWell many of us dont believe that and a lot of Americans donteither There are a lot of good parts of our system we want to protectbut there are many parts that need to be changed We need to makehealth care and health insurance more affordable for families andindividuals and businesses This bill doesWe just had another report from the Congressional Budget Office thatsaid yes the cost of premiums will be coming down for many Americansas a result of this bill We also understand that some 50 millionAmericans dont have health insurance at all This bill will reach thehighest level of protection for health insurance in the history of theUnited States Ninetyfour percent of people in this country will havethe peace of mind and security of health insurancea dramaticincrease The Republicans have been unable to come up with any proposalthat moves us toward more coverage for people who dont have healthinsuranceThis bill also has many provisions to finally give consumers acrossAmerica a chance to fight back when the insurance companies say no andthey do all the time People who need critical surgical procedures andmedicines people who need the kind of care their doctors recommend endup fighting with the clerk at an insurance company This bill theDemocratic health care reform bill gives these families a fightingchance against these health insurance companies I have yet to see thefirst bill coming from the Republican side of the aisle in the courseof this debate that would give our families a chance against thesehealth insurance companiesI wish to also say when I finish speaking and we finish on this sideof the aisle the Senator from Utah will come and speak I understandit is the Medicare Advantage Program he will speak to Now theprevious motion to commit by Senator MCCain of Arizona said Send thisbill back and make sure you take out any reference to savings in theMedicare Advantage Program That was defeated The vote was 42 to 58There were two Democrats who joined the Republicans They needed 60votes it didnt make it I take it the Senator from Utah may offeranother motion to commit relative to Medicare Advantage I expect it tohave the same fate but he has his chance to argue his point of viewand he may be persuasive to more Members on this side of the aisleUnfortunately although we are good close friends and I bask in hiswisdom on a daily basis he is not going to change my mind on thisissue because the Medicare Advantage Program is a program that needs tobe changedLet me tell my colleagues about this program We started years agowith the health insurance industry telling us Government cannot do agood job when it comes to insurance Let us show you how private healthinsurance companies can sell a Medicare policy more cheaply than thegovernment And we invited them to do itOver the course of the years some of them did They showed somesavings and they demonstrated to us they could provide Medicare at acost lower than the government But then things changed and the healthinsurance companies kept coming back and saying Well we actually needmore money now to provide the same benefits in Medicare that thegovernment providesAt last count the Medicare Advantage Program costs 14 percent moreto provide the same Medicare benefits as the government program Sothese leaders in the private sector who were going to teach us a lessonabout how to sell insurance ended up failing their own lesson plan andnow this Medicare Advantage Program has turned out to be a flatoutsubsidy to the health insurance industry170 billion over 10 yearsIn other words the Medicare Program is paying more for Medicare thanwhat it has to pay so it can subsidize health insurance companies whichare turning multimilliondollar profits and giving bonuses to theirCEOsSome on the other side of the aisle think we need to preserve thisthat we need to preserve this subsidy make sure we protect the profitsof the health insurance companies and we need to protect MedicareAdvantage Well as Senator Dodd has said so frequently on the Senatefloor Medicare Advantage is neither Medicare nor an advantageI believe and most agree it is time for this party to end Theseprivate health insurance companies didnt keep their word didnt keeptheir promise and because of that we are in a situationapredicamentwhere we are asking other people covered by Medicare tosubsidize the profits of these private health insurance companies Whatdoes it cost every Medicare recipient in America to provide thissubsidy and profits to these private health insurance companies underMedicare Advantage Ninety dollars a year on averageSo those who are defending the Medicare Advantage Program as wecurrently know it and dont support the reforms in this bill are alsosupporting a 90 annual tax on Medicare recipients My fiscallyconservative Republican friends who run against taxes every chance theyhave should reflect on the fact that they are protecting a tax onMedicare recipients That to me is indefensible   It was very basic I would say to the Senator from RhodeIsland through the Chair They just said Now listen When it comes toinsurance the government never gets it right The bureaucrats who workfor the government those Federal employees dont get it right We dothis for a living We can show you how to provide Medicare benefits andsave money So please would you just step aside The private healthinsurance companies are going to demonstrate to you how much money wecan saveInitially there were some savings I will say that in fairness Butover the years they got greedy and their greediness led in mostrecent times toI think in 2003 if I am not mistaken with theMedicare prescription drug program when they came in and these sameprivate health insurance companies said Now we really need subsidiesto keep offering our wonderful programs now they tell us they arecharging 14 percent more than basic Medicare President I ask unanimous consent for 5 additionalminutes   I would say to the Senator from Ohio that is exactly whathappened because what we have is that in order to pay for the subsidythe private health insurance companies that are selling MedicareAdvantage they had to take the money out of the Medicare system whichmeant less money for everybody else It translated into 90 a year morefor every Medicare recipient to pay for the subsidy for the privatehealth insurance companies that are protected by Medicare Advantage   I would say to the Senator from Ohio the differenceis obvious With Medicare anyone who shows up age 65 is eligible forcoverage no questions asked other than your age and whether you havecontributed over the course of your lifetime These health insurancecompanies cherrypick the healthiest people they can then try to denycoverage where they can as well and that is how they make theirprofits  Make it a triple whammy because the third impact ofcourse is that the healthier people are not part of Medicare Thoseleft in Medicare are sicker and more expensive so the governmentrunprogram ends up being more expensive because those private healthinsurance companies cherrypick out the healthiest people they canfindThere are those who want to defend Medicare Advantage who think it isgreat that we would pay 170 billion in subsidies to these companiesover a 10year period of time This bill moves us away from that andsays if these private health insurance companies cant basicallycompete and match what government Medicare offers then it is time forthem to get out of the business and get out of the way I dont see whyin the world we are arguing about a subsidy for private healthinsurance companies when they already make so much moneySo I would at this point yield the floor I know Senator Hatch hasasked for an hour to speak on his motion I believe it is a motion tocommit I yield the floor

Whitehouse on fiscalresponsibility Also pending is a motion to commit by the Senator fromUtah on Medicare Advantage It would be my hope that the Senate willvote on these matters todayMr President I suggest the absence of a quorumThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The clerk will call the rollThe assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll President I ask unanimous consent the order for thequorum call be rescindedThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Without objection it is soorderedUnder the previous order the time until 1130 am will be fordebate only with the time equally divided and controlled between thetwo leaders or their designees with the majority controlling the firstportion of timeThe Senator from Montana is recognized President experts and economists of every politicalstripe agree that preserving Americas longterm economic securitymeans reforming the way we provide and pay for health care Health carespending makes up onesixth of the US economy Future generations canexpect the burden of insurmountable debt if we fail to actThe fiscal challenges we may face in years to come pale in comparisonto the threat of uncontrolled Federal health care spending The chartbehind me essentially shows that The chart shows the percentage annualgrowth rates beginning in 2004 The red is the economy the blue ishealth care costs Clearly over time especially as the economy dippedduring this great recession the gap between economic growth and healthcare spending has widened Projections are that in future years theywill widen more and more As you can see out to 2018 the total economyis projected Near 2018 the economy is above 4 percent and health carespending is 7 or 8 percentDoing nothing means health care spending continues to grow fasterthan our economy That is what that chart shows quite dramaticallyDoing nothing means entitlement spending more than doubles by the year2050 That is taking onefifth of our gross domestic productBut it is not simply the Federal budget on the line it is the familybudget too Incredibly in total we are spending 80 times as much onhealth care today as we did five decades ago80 times more on healthcare today than we did five decades ago Now family budgets arebreaking under the strainalready That is going to get worse if we donothing The cost of the average family health care plan will reach24000 in the year 2016 That is not too many years away from nowThis represents an 84percent increase over 2008 premium levels Thatmeans if we do nothing in fewer than 10 years most families wouldhave to dedicate half of their household budget to health insuranceFor years we have heard the warnings from Federal budget experts Nowwe are hearing every day from folks back home who simply cannot affordthe care they needWe have an obligation to act Now we have an opportunity to act Thecountrys leading economists and Federal budget experts laid outstrategies and options for getting costs under control We have takentheir recommendations to heart There is a lot of agreement among thosewho study these issues of what we must do Now we have a bill that doeswhat they suggest It also passes the test of fiscal responsibilityWe have many reasons to vote for this bill It protects and evenincreases Medicare benefits for seniors It achieves near universalcoverage in less than 10 years That means it achieves the goal ofvirtually everybody having health insurance in that period of time Itslows the growth of Federal health care spending It stops insuranceindustry discrimination and based on independent nonpartisananalysis makes a serious dent in our Federal deficitThis chart behind me represents what 2 weeks ago the CongressionalBudget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation confirmed in no uncertainterms that deficits go down under this plan The official costestimate reads as followsThe Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee onTax estimates that on balance the direct spending and revenueeffects of enacting this Patient Protection and AffordableCare Act legislation would yield a net reduction in Federaldeficits of 130 billion over the years 2010 to 2019 That isrepresented by the green bar on the left It is a net 130billion reduction during the first 10 years of this billIn addition to reducing the Federal deficit in the first decade theCBO also tells us that the bill decreases the deficit by a much greateramount by 650 billion in the second decadeAccording to the CBO this bill also slows the growth of Medicarecosts which has been a principal goal in our Medicare debate since dayone Medicare spending would grow 6 percent annually instead of 8percent annually In other words Medicare would continue to grow butunlike today it will grow at a sustainable rateOf course no projections even from the Congressional Budget Officecan be certain We can safely say this bill will put us on the righttrack We can safely say this bill is better than doing nothing Nohonest assessment challenges the case for acting now to slow the growthof Federal spending No honest assessment challenges the case And nohonest assessment of this bill challenges the CBO analysis I have notheard one I have not heard an honest challenge to the CBO analysisnor have I heard of a good honest case for not acting now to slow thegrowth of Federal spending which means we have many reasons to passhealth care reform not the least of which is the longterm financialhealth of the economy and our Nation But the reasons for passing thisare much more than simply facts and figures This is about Americansfrom every corner of this great country struggling to make ends meetforced into bankruptcy by medical tragedy This is about stoppinginsurance industry discrimination this is about saving Medicare forour seniors and reducing the deficit for our grandchildrenI dont know which other Senators wish to speak Senator Bingamanwishes to gain recognition in the time we haveLet me ascertain how much time we have and how many speakers we haveThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator has 40 minutesThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from New Mexico  I might modify that so this side gets the next 30 minutesafter that  President if I may I ask unanimous consent that weextend for an additional hour the period for debate only with nofurther amendments or motions in order during the hour and that thetime be equally divided between the two sides with the Republicanscontrolling the first 30 minutes and the majority controlling thesecond 30 minutes I believe there is 3 minutes remaining on the firstblock on the majority sideThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore There is 2 minutes 20 secondsThe Senator from Ohio is recognized  President I think I will use my 2 minutes 20secondsThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore And 15 seconds The Senator fromArizona talks about gee all these Medicare Advantage plans havedental and vision coverage He goes on to say so do Members ofCongressThe fact is that is not automatically true The fact is Members ofCongress choose among various private plans Some plans offer dentaland vision some do not Aetna is a company that Members of Congresscould choose from under FEHBP and others that Members of Congress canchoose from Those do provide dental and vision coverage But there areothersI think Blue Cross and Blue Shield does not provide dental andvision coverageI make that point because this is exactly what we are trying to setup in these exchanges People could participate in the exchanges wherethey would buy private coverage and they could choose among variousprivate plans which coverage they want Do they want a plan that coversdental and vision or not That is exactly what we are trying to do inthe exchange as is the case for Members of Congress MedicareAdvantage plans do provide dental and vision I think that is greatI see my time has expired At the appropriate time I wish to go intogreater detail and explain why what we do in this bill I think makeseminent senseThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Iowa isrecognized  President I understand we are now under the orderwhere there is a half hour allocated to the majority side is thatcorrect President I just want to help people understand thislegislation I am sure many do but I am sure there are some who do notwith respect to the choices people will haveWe have a uniquely American system of health care in America It isroughly half public half private The goal of this legislation is toretain what we have that is basically have that same balance ofpublic and private It has worked pretty well for America It isuniquely American We are not Canada We are not Great Britain We arenot Switzerland We are the United States of America I think it isgood to build on our current system and make our current system workbetterI am prompted to explain the choices in part by the statements bythe senior Senator from Arizona who said Medicare Advantage plansenable people to get eyeglasses and dental care And that is true Buthe went on to say that gee shouldnt Members of Congress who likeall that and want to keep all thatthat Members of Congress get freedental and free eyeglasses Well that is really not true Members ofCongress do not get that But it is true Members of Congressparticipate inall Federal employees Members of Congress people inthe Forest Service people all around the countryall Federalemployees participate in the same system It is called FEHBP It is theFederal Employees Health Benefits Plan where Federal employees andMembers of Congress all together the same can choose among manydifferent private health insurance plans There is an open enrollmentseasonin fact we are in the midst of it right nowwhere Members ofCongress and all Federal employees can look to see if they want tochoose a different insurance company or not Some of those companies doprovide dental and vision coverage Some do not So if a Federalemployee wants to choose a plan that covers dental and vision he orshe can do so Just pay the premium and you are covered with dentaland visionWe are setting up under this legislation an exchange that is verysimilaralmost identicalto the FEHBP where people who do not havehealth insurance can go look on the exchange and choose among privatecompanies which one makes the most sense for them Some may havedental some may have eyeglass coverage some may not That is just achoice people can makeIn addition to that there is even more choice because currently aFederal employee does not have to join FEHBP A Federal employee canchoose not to get health insurance if he or she does not want to ormaybe they get it through their spouse someplace else The same can betrue with the exchange set up in this legislation The person could buyamong different competing private plans that offer health insurance onthe exchange or a person can go outside the exchange because he or shethinks they can get a better deal if that person wants toSo I just want to make it clear that we are encouraging choice Weare encouraging competition And I might say that under thelegislation Members of Congress who fully participate in this will becoequal with others If there is a private option Members of Congresscan participate in that as well In fact we are requiring Senators andtheir staffsthey do not have to participate in the exchange but itis certainly available to them and they can opt out if they want toLet me just say a little bit about Medicare Advantage What doesMedPAC say about Medicare Advantage Several years ago Congressestablished an advisory board that is now called MedPAC to advise themon how Medicare should pay providers in traditional fee for service andprivate health insurers in Medicare Advantage Again MedicareAdvantage is with private companies They have executives They havestockholders They are private companies MedPAC advises us how muchCongress should pay MedPAC and other Medicare providers in traditionalfee for service It is an independent agency Its experts arenonpartisan highly respectedEach year they send a report to Congress that examines issues inMedicare Here is what MedPAC had to say about the current state ofMedicare Advantage in its 2009 June report I am going to quote nowfrom this independent advisory panelFirst we estimate that in 2009 Medicare pays about 12billion more for enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans thanit would if it were feeforservice MedicareSecondCurrent high payments have resulted in some plans thatbring no innovation but simply mimic feeforservice Medicareat a much higher cost to the programIn other words they are saying that Medicare Advantage plans getpaid for a lot more but with no innovation compared to the feeforservice MedicareMedPAC saysThis situation is unfair to taxpayers and beneficiaries notenrolled in Medicare Advantage who subsidize the highercostsWell that is pretty obviousIn addition MedPAC goes on to sayThe excessive payments encourage inefficient plans to enterthe program further raising costs to MedicareThere are so many dollars currently given to Medicare Advantageplans according to MedPAC that encourages inefficient plans to enterthe program Why not They are getting all of this extra moneyFurther quotingThe cost of Medicare Advantage subsidies is borne bytaxpayers who finance the Medicare program and by allMedicare beneficiaries via Part B premiumsOr to say it differently about 78 percent of Americans who are notin Medicare Advantage plans are paying in effect a 90peryear taxfor which they get no benefit which goes into the Medicare AdvantageplansIn additionThe Part B premium for all beneficiaries is increased byabout 3 a month regardless of whether you receive thebenefitA couple of more quotes from MedPACThe additional Medicare Advantage payments hasten theinsolvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund by 18 monthsThat is an interesting statement The additional payments hasten theinsolvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund by 18 monthsGoing with quotes from MedPACAlthough many plans are available only some are of highqualityIn addition continuing the quoteOnly about half of the beneficiaries nationwide have accessto a plan that CMS rates as above average in overall planqualityThis is what MedPAC says That is the nonpartisan expert that helpsadvise Congress on what reimbursement levels should beWe have heard day after day that this bill is cutting Medicarebenefits for our seniors When my colleagues on the other side of theaisle realized this bill does not cut reduce ration or eliminate asingle guaranteed benefit they turned their argument to MedicareAdvantage I think they finally recognize there are no guaranteedbenefits cut in this legislation so they turn to Medicare AdvantageThey argue that the efficiencies and savings achieved by endingbillions of dollars of overpayments to these private plans will eitherend the program or dramatically cut services to beneficiariesBut lets just look at the numbers I have a chart behind me Thischart shows the yearly spending for Medicare Advantage in billions ofdollars So you can see from the chart that in the year 2009 110billion will be spent on Medicare Advantage plans That is the farleft Moving to the right 10 years later in the year 2019 about 204billion is spent So if we total it all up about 17 trillion will bespent on Medicare Advantage plans over the next 10 yearsYou see that littlewhat color is that It is kind of orange it iskind of an interesting sort of redwhatever it is at the top of thatchart That represents the reduction in Medicare Advantage planpayments under this legislation It is not very much as you can tellby looking at the chart It averages out I think to around a 10percent reduction in Medicare Advantage paymentsSo when we see these big crocodile tears and we hear MedicareAdvantage is being cut when we hear all of these dramatic statementsthat so much is going to be taken away from seniors because Congress iscutting Medicare Advantage the fact is we are reducing the rate ofincrease in Medicare Advantage payments by only about 10 percent andunder this legislation about 17 trillion will be spent on MedicareAdvantage plans Remember MedPAC says these are overpayments MedPACsays this 10 percent reduction is what they should be paidRemember too these are private plans These are private companiesIt is not Medicare These are private companies receiving thesepayments and they are insurance companies It is interesting to methat a lot of Members of Congress arent too wild about insurancecompanies Well Medicare Advantage companies are insurance companiesThat is what they are They are private insurance companies They areprivate insurance companies They have their private insurance companychief executive They have their private insurance company officerThey have their private insurance company stockholders They have theirprivate insurance company administrative costs and marketing expensesThey are private insurance companies That is what they are So weshould not lose sight of all of thatI wish to also point out that as private insurance companies theseMedicare Advantage plans are doing pretty well Let me quote from anOppenheimer Capital analyst in a November 12 report about MedicareAdvantage plans He saidBetween 2006 and 2009 we estimate that Medicare Advantageaccounted for nearly 75 percent of the increase in grossprofits among the larger plans in the industry highlightedby an estimated gross profit increase of 19 billion in2009 relative to commercial risk earnings gains of nearly600 millionCommercial risk earnings gains are the ordinary health insurancecompanies but 75 percent of the gross profit increase was underMedicare Advantage plans not traditional health insuranceI might say tooI dont have the papers maybe I can find them Itis worth noting it underlines the point that these are privatecompanies It is not traditional MedicareHere it is Because it is interesting lets look at the compensationof these insurance company executives of these Medicare Advantageplans the CEOs The total compensation of a CEO at Aetna is 24million a year The total compensation of the CEO at Coventry is 9million a year at Wellcare 8 million at Humana 47 million ayear and at United Health Care 3 million Now people should be ableto make some money and officers of companies should be able to do OKbut here we are talking about very high salaries that these insurancecompanies pay to their top executives Frankly if there is a 10percent reduction in the 17 trillion over 10 years they could youwould think take some of that 10 percent maybe in salary reduction ordividends to stockholders make other cost savings It doesnt have tocome out of the beneficiaries It is they the executives who aremaking these decisions of where the 10percent reduction is allocatedBottom line I just wish to say I am not opposed to MedicareAdvantage plans Frankly I think it is good we have Medicare Advantageplans Medicare Advantage plans provide the competition to MedicareThey help keep the system on its toes But we have an obligation asMembers of this Senate to the taxpayers and to seniors to cut waste andto cut overpayments in a way that does not harm beneficiaries Theseare reductions recommended to Congress by the best advisory board ofexperts we could find They didnt just come out of thin air andMembers of Congress thought this up This was recommended to us by theMedPAC advisory boardSecond there is no reduction in guaranteed benefits to seniors Thatis absolute There is no reduction in guaranteed benefits to MedicareAdvantage participants So A we are being fair This chart shows itWe are trying to find the right level of reimbursement set up in a wayso there is no reduction in beneficiaries benefits In fact in thislegislation we add more benefits for Medicare participants MedicareAdvantage as well as traditional feeforservice Medicare I might addin this legislation we give an increase to Medicare Advantage plansthat show demonstrated improvement in qualityAs I mentioned MedPAC said a lot of these plans are totallyinefficient A lot of these plans have no coordinated care A lot ofthese plans dont have any quality but they get the extra money So weare saying lets get to a compensation level that is fair We do it ona competitive bidding basis take the average bid for an area and wealso say lets make sure there is no reduction in guaranteed benefitsat the same time I think that is a responsible thing to doSo all of these arguments these sound bites frankly that you hearfrom the other side of the aisle are just that they are sound bitesThey are not the honest analysis of what is going onSo I encourage us to keep in mind keep in perspective what we aredoing so we can help provide a better health care system for ourcountry This is only one part of it There are many other parts butthis is just this one partHow much time do we have remaining Mr President At this time I yieldto the Senator from Michigan  I askunanimous consent that the Senator from Wyoming be recognized to speakfor debate only and at a later point we will figure out allocation oftime on both sides if he wishes to speak now  President I yield 5 minutes to the Senator fromWisconsin  President the pending motion would strike thesavings the bill achieves from Medicare AdvantageWhy are we seeking savings from Medicare Advantage Because MedPACtells us that the government pays the private insurance companies thatprovide Medicare Advantage 14 percent more than we pay traditionalMedicare because these extra subsidies to Medicare Advantage cost thefourfifths of seniors in traditional Medicare 90 more a year inpremiums even though they get no benefits from Medicare Advantagebecause MedPAC says that the additional Medicare Advantage paymentshasten the insolvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund by 18 monthsbecause the private insurance companies that provide Medicare Advantageare making threequarters of their profits from these governmentoverpayments and they can find some of the savings there becauseprivate insurance companies that provide Medicare Advantage are payingtheir CEOs 24 million 9 million and 8 million a year and theycould find some of the savings there and because nothing we do in ourbill reduces benefits under MedicareTherefore I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion   President the Senator from Arkansas is to berecognized to offer an amendmentAmendment No 2905 to Amendment No 2786   President I think we are going to go back and forthhere  Sorry  Here is SenatorKaufman  President I have heard a lot here today about howthis is going to hurt seniors and so on and so forth words such assmokescreen The fact is there is no smokescreen here whatsoeverThis is a very well thought out considered policy that I think strikesa very good balance between getting care to especially seniors at homewhich is so important on the one hand and making sure there is notwaste on the other hand That is our responsibility here to make surethe program works and works wellI have sort of a special interest in this My mother was in thehospital It happened about 2 weeks ago She fortunately is doing muchbetter She is out of the hospital She has spent some time with a homehealth caregiver with whom I was very very impressed This home healthperson is doing a great job with my mother I have seen other instancestoo but personally I was very happy to see my mother getting very goodcare from a home health care nurseI think it is also important to remind my colleagues that thisamendment is generally a retread on the MCCain amendment we debatedover the last few days That is once again the opponents of this billare endorsing the status quo that leaves Medicare on the brink of goingbankrupt and seniors facing higher costsLet me remind my colleagues again what will happen if we stick withthe status quo The status quo meaning no bill which the other sideis advocating means Medicare will go broke in 8 years That is thestatus quo In our legislation that will be postponed for at least 5more years The status quo as in no bill which the other side isadvocating means seniors will continue to pay higher and higherpremiums and cost sharing due to wasteful overpayments to health careprovidersThere is so much waste in our system We all know there is a lot ofwaste I am quite surprised not all of our colleagues want to cut outthe waste In effect they want to keep the waste that unfortunatelyis in our systemThe status quo also means each year billions of Medicare dollars willcontinue to be wasted on lining the pockets of private insurancecompanies That might be a bit of a strong statement but the fact issome chief executives of private insurance companies are paid tens ofmillions of dollars to manage Medicare Programs especially MedicareAdvantage and the status quo means that will continueThe status quo also means seniors will continue struggling to pay forprescription drugs The stakes for seniors in the Medicare Program havenever been higherWe have a choice It is a very simple choice either endorse thestatus quo or strengthen MedicareLets talk a little bit about home health care Regarding Medicarechanges for home health providers let me describe what is in theSenate bill I dont think our colleagues know specifically what is inthe Senate bill That may be a strong statement to make But if theyknew what was in the bill I think some of the statements made tonightmight be a little bit differentAs most of my colleagues would agree home health care is anextremely important benefit in the Medicare Program We are all verystrong advocates of home health care Across the country there aremore than 9800 home health agencies providing care to seniors in theirhomes This helps seniors get better and helps them to avoid expensiverehospitalizationsWe are all champions of home health care We would like people not tobe institutionalized It is much more appropriate to have care in thehome and home health care agencies provide thatIn Montana home health care providers go the extra mileliterallyto provide care to patients across vast distances In some cases inrural areas they have to drive 100 miles just to see one patient Theyare dedicated people They go great distances and travel a long way tosee very few patientsHome health providers make a real difference in improving seniorshealth and we should support their efforts We all very much supporttheir effortsWhile I have great respect for the services of home health providerswe also have a responsibility to protect the Medicare ProgramUnfortunately there is almost always waste somewhere It is a matterof judgment as to how much is waste and how much is notWe must make sure Medicare is paying appropriately that is thatMedicare is not overpaying for Medicare services We must take actionto root out fraud and abuse in the Medicare Program generally and whereit may occur in the home health industry as wellI think the policies in the Senate bill achieve both goals Firstthe Senate bill would rebase home health payments to ensurepayments reflect actual costs of providing care These changes arebased on recommendations by MedPAC which is the independent advisorycommission that advises Congress on Medicare reimbursement It is anonpartisan group MedPAC advises that we rebase What do we mean byrebaseWhen the current home health payments were set seniors received anaverage of 31 visits per episode Today they receive 22 visits thatis they get paid about the same for doing less We are trying to makesure the payment reflects the actual services provided The Senate billdirects CMS to rebase payments to reflect this change It is commonsense MedPAC recommended it and thinks it has to keep up with thetimes Times have changed over the years and the payment system shouldreflect that changeThere is something else I think is pretty important and most of mycolleagues would agree the Senate bill roots out fraud thatunfortunately exists in home health care as well as in other areas ofMedicare spending It tries to root out the fraud in Medicare paymentsfor outlier casesMedicare provides an extra payment today for providershome healthfolkswho treat sicker people otherwise known as outlier patientsreally sick outliers Unfortunately the GAO found that some providerswere gaming the system and getting much more outlier payments than theydeserveFor example the GAO found that in one Florida county alone homehealth providers were receiving 60 percent of all total outlierpayments That is nationwide One county was getting 60 percent eventhough they had less than 1 percent of the total Medicare population Idont want to just single out Florida Other counties in the southernpart of the country clearly have a grossly disproportionate amount ofhigh outlier paymentsThe Senate addresses this problem by placing a cap on the amount anyindividual provider can receive in outlier paymentsAnother change is the bill makes market basket changes in 2011and 2012 That was recommended by MedPAC Why is that important MedPACis actually much tougher They wanted to start in 2010 We said we willhold off a bit We wanted to be fair to the home health providers Inaddition the bill establishes a productivity adjustment for homehealth providers beginning not right away not next year or thefollowing year but in 2015These changes ask home health providerslike all other providerstooffer more efficient and higher quality care over time We are beingfair about it Very importantly in making these changes we workedclosely with the home health industry to ensure these changes werereasonable and fairWhat do we do with respect to the agencies to make sure we are fairOn the rebasing policy MedPAC recommended that we fully implementthese changes in 2011 To ensure that providers can adapt to the newpayment rates we in the Senate decided we would phase in these changesover 4 years The home health providers support this phase in Theythink it is a good ideaOn the outlier policy and the fraud changes these policies wereactually suggested to us byguess whothe home health industry Theycame to us and suggested we make some changes in outliers because toomany agencies are gaming the system They asked us to make some outlierchanges and stop that gaming to make changes to stop the fraud Theycame to us and gave us some ideas Obviously the home health industryfully supports the changes they recommended to us They are in thisbillOn the market basket and productivity changes the Senate bill holdsoff on applying these reductions while the rebasing policy is takingeffectThis bill gives home health agencies extra timemuch more time thanis recommended by the very aggressive proposed changes by MedPAC theHouse bill and the administration We say those are too aggressive Wein the Senate decided to give agencies extra time to adapt to thepayment changes in the bill rather than having all these implemented atthe same time as MedPAC and the House and the administration allrecommendedFinally with respect to rural home health providers we are all verysensitive to the special needs of rural America What did we do aboutthat From 2010 to 2015 rural providers will receive a 3percent extrapayment each year This payment will ensure that rural providers areprotected as we reform the home health systemIn total the home health changes in the Senate bill I believestrike a fair balance between ensuring seniors have access to homecare while also rooting out inappropriate payments from the systemI hear some of my good friends say Gee these changes are going tohurt seniors They are not going to hurt them In fact most of thechanges are suggested by the home health care industry I think all ofus want to root out fraud and waste Also it is claimed that Medicarebeneficiaries will be harmed by this bill This is a scare tacticLet me say what the American Association of Retired Persons saysabout these claims that these changes in Medicare reimbursement aregoing to harm seniorsAARP saysOpponents of the health reform wont rest They are usingmyths and misinformation to distort the truth and wronglysuggesting that Medicare will be harmed After a lifetime ofhard work dont seniors deserve betterThat is AARP I dont suggest tonight that any of our colleagues areusing myths and misinformation to distort the truth The point is AARPclaims that is not true They support the bill stronglyI will remind my colleagues of some of the positive changes in thelegislation This legislation improves the solvency of the MedicareProgram by 5 years It puts 30 billion back into the pockets ofseniors in the form of lower Medicare premiums It makes prescriptiondrugs more affordable which is an added benefit in this bill thatwould not be available if the legislation is not passed The billguarantees that seniors can continue to see a doctor of their choosingThe bill provides free wellness and prevention benefits Those are newbenefits They dont currently exist It will also include fair andappropriate changes for home health that protect access to careI dont question the motives of my colleagues They believe they arestanding up for seniors in opposing the home health changes But intruth they will harm them because they are hurting the MedicareProgram I dont think we want to hurt the Medicare Program We aretrying to help the Medicare Program by making these changesThere is one other point I want to make This is kind of interestingI thought when I saw itif I still have itit is kind of interestingThe growth rate in home health care spending will continue to be veryhigh after this legislation passes Currently the growth rate of thehome health care industry is almost 11 percent per year After thelegislation it will be almost an 8percent annual growth in the homehealth care industry That is much faster than the national healthexpendituresI think most things in life are a judgment call I think one fairlydecides that the changes in this bill are good for seniors and homehealth care providers because they are sensitive to the needs of theindustry sensitive to patients frankly but also responsible to theAmerican taxpayers by making sure we are rooting out waste  President I ask unanimous consent that the Senateproceed to a period of morning business with

S_DE_KAUFMAN,2009-12-04, Madam President I ask unanimous consent to speak inmorning business for up to 5 minutes  President I wish to honor the service of a greatFederal employeeHuman ingenuity is boundless This is especially true in Americawhich has always been driven by an entrepreneurial spirit and a beliefthat nothing is impossibleFrom Whitneys cotton gin to the first elevator from the electrictelegraph to the refrigerated rail car our forbearers used theiringenuity to help build a nation Such invention and perseveranceclosed the western frontier in the nineteenth century In the centurythat followed Americans continued to be pioneers on that frontierwhich has no endthe frontier of scienceSixtyseven years ago this week a team of American physicists led byEnrico Fermi conducted a critical experiment On a cold wintersafternoon they huddled under the stands of the old football stadium atthe University of Chicago Using graphite blocks wooden rods anduranium pellets they initiated the firstever controlled nuclearreactionThat experiment called Chicago Pile One marked the beginning ofthe nuclear ageToday all Americans know that the discovery of nuclear power was amixed blessing With it came the potential for a new form of energy topower our homes and businesses For the first time our naval shipscould remain at seaand on guardfor extended periods withoutrefuelingBut with nuclear energy came nuclear weapons These led to thedangerous prospect of the mass destruction of hundreds of cities withinminutes They brought us a generation of duck and cover andbackyard fallout sheltersThankfullythough our nation and others continue to possess theseweapons in our timethe Cold War is over No longer are we minutesfrom mutually assured destruction the way we once wereToday peaceful nuclear energy provides a fifth of our electricityand there are 104 civilian reactors in operation across the countryDeveloping and enforcing the regulations that keep these reactorssafe are the men and women of the US Nuclear Regulatory CommissionThis week I wish to recognize the contribution of an outstandingpublic servant Dr Gareth Parry Gareth has had a distinguished careerat the Nuclear Regulatory Commission advancing our nuclear safetyHe is also a 2004 recipient of the distinguished Arthur S FlemmingAward for public serviceGareth who immigrated to this country from the United Kingdom hasover thirty years of experience in developing models for probabilisticrisk analysisor PRA He retired this September after a long anddistinguished careerAs senior adviser on PRA for the Commissions Office of NuclearReactor Regulation Gareth became one of the leading experts onanalyzing common cause failure and human reliability His work led tothe development of PRA standards and the use of PRA to support riskinformed decisionmaking with regard to nuclear safetyGareth as a scientist and a public servant worked hard to ensurethe safety of Americas civilian nuclear facilitiesThe kind of work he performed is highly mathematical and complex andit may not sound glamorous to the average American but it is criticaland contributes enormously to the security and economic wellbeing ofour NationSixtyseven years ago Fermi and his team first harnessed the powerof the atom Today the men and women of the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission ensure that our modern nuclear reactors continue to do sosafelyI hope my colleagues will join me in honoring the service of DrGareth Parry and all who have workedand continue to workat theNuclear Regulatory Commission President tonight the Strategic Arms ReductionTreaty will expire and with it the primary framework for the reductionof nuclear weapons for the last 20 years Today I would like to speaka few minutes about the critical importance of an offensive strategicarms reduction and why we must establish a followon treaty to STARTIn September President Obama proposed a resolution to the UnitedNations Security Council to eliminate nuclear weapons ban productionof the fissile material outlaw nuclear testsand safeguard existing weapons stockpiles World leaders approved theresolution joining with the Presidents previous statements thatAmerica seeks a world with no nuclear weapons This is not a visionof unilateral disarmament but a vision for multilateral action It isa vision of working step by step with every nation to draw down nucleararsenals together It is a critically important goal and one of thebest ways to ensure a safer future and a safer worldIn the past few years we have seen a rise in clandestine nuclearprograms developed by rogue states including those which havesuccessfully acquired a nuclear arsenal This growing threatprimarilyfrom North Korea and Iranunderscores the value of internationalstrategic arms treaties These are global challenges which requireglobal solutions and a multilateral approach The best way to combatproliferation is unity of the international community and I am pleasedthat one of the greatest successes of President Obamas policy ofengagement with Iran has been a growing convergence of viewsidentifying Irans nuclear program as a threat not just to one regionbut to the worldWhile multilateralism is the best way to effectively reduce thethreat posed by nuclear weapons we must look to successful bilateralagreements as a model including START This historic agreement laidthe groundwork for a common understanding between the United States andRussia regarding nuclear weapons and truly symbolized the end of theCold War It allowed us to talk about previously taboo subjects suchas the Triad and intrusive verification and develop a shared languageof expertise and evaluation that reduced our nuclear arsenals Moreimportantly it provided a process of arbitration that avoidsconfrontation establishes legal mechanisms to forever avoid a nuclearwarThe stability START provided allowed both the United States andRussia to reduce our nuclear stockpiles and engage in negotiationsabout curbing proliferation worldwide It also built great confidencein the other as a partner Since its inception START has served as anenabler of global nonproliferation efforts Now this critical treatyis set to expire and it is time to move to establish a followon whichreflects the requirements of the 21st century and allows the UnitedStates and Russia to continue this valuable partnership innonproliferation togetherThis is why I am a cosponsor of legislation which provides a legalbasis for extending the START verification regime and I stronglysupport the work of the Obama administrationunder the leadership ofAssistant Secretary of State for Verification and Compliance RoseGottemoellerto negotiate the followon treaty We owe it to Americansto place consideration of the new treaty at the top of the agenda whenit is submitted so the United States can continue to pave the waytoward a safer and more secure world
S_KS_ROBERTS,2009-12-04, Madam President I rise today in support of the motionof my good friend from Nebraska my colleague from Nebraska SenatorJohanns tothe official words say to commit the bill back to theSenate Finance Committee with instructions to strike the cuts to theMedicare home health care benefitWhat the distinguished Senator is trying to do is bring some commonsense to the cuts to a very vital source of health care not only torural areas but all over this country and that is home health careThe bill we are considering the bill sometimes called thebehind closed doors bill would cut home health care by 42billionThe Senator from Nebraska says that is a headscratcher and itcertainly is It is more than a head scratcher it is a Lizzie Bordenamputation in regard to a vital programHome health care is critical for our seniors Obviously that is thetruth As the cochair of the Senate Rural Health Care Caucus Icertainly understand that So does the Senator from Nebraska He wassaying yesterday how many times he visits his rural hospitals ruralclinics rural hospices and you do that a lot if you are from Nebraskaor Iowa or Texas or KansasAt any rate in my home State of Kansas and other rural areas manyseniors live alone or out in the country miles away from a localhospital or a doctors office Even if they have a very good doctorthey cant get there because of their health condition So home healthcare allows those seniors the freedom and the independence to stay intheir home in the comfort of knowing somebody is there assisting theirhealth care needs More importantly home health care is the costeffective care as the Senator from Nebraska has pointed out thatkeeps the senior out of a nursing home or hospital andguess whatsaves the government money Over the long term if you cut home healthcare you are going to increase the cost in regard to nursing homes noquestion about itIn my State I have had the pleasure of being able to see firsthandas has the Senator from Nebraska the great work our Kansas Home HealthCare Association members do every day Last year I was invited into thehome of a lovely couple in Concordia KS America not too far fromNebraska and despite having multiple health issues Duane and Phylliswere able to stay in their home with their little dog Josie all thanksto the services provided by a home health care aide and a home nurseWhat is going to happen to seniors such as Duane and Phyllis if weslash 42 billion from home health care payments Fortytwo billiondollars is one of the largest Medicare cuts in the whole bill next toMedicare Advantage and the hospitals The Senator from Nebraska hadthat chart showing serious cuts to all of our providers Dont forgetthat this cut comes on the heels of several years of additional cuts tohome health carearound 35 billion all toldthat already have alarge percentage of Kansas home health care agencies operating at veryslim or negative Medicare margins I know the same is true in Iowa andthe same is true in Texas in Montana in Nebraska and all over thecountryI keep hearing my colleagues however on the other side of the aisleinsisting that their 12 trillion cut to all Medicarehere is thequotewont affect the benefits guaranteed to seniors Please stopthat Please stop that That is the most disingenuous smokescreen inthis whole debate It may be true that this bill does not explicitlycut benefits My friends across the aisle however cannot deny thattheir cuts in reimbursements to providers will affect those benefitsbecause when you cut the reimbursements to providers guess who paysthe price The patientsDuane and Phyllis and their little dog JosieI tell you what You come to their house and you make that argumentthat if you close down or make cuts to home health care Duane is notgoing to like it Phyllis is not going to like it and Josie will biteyou on your legAs I said many of my Kansas home health care agencies are alreadyoperating at negative margins Their projected share of these cuts asprovided by the distinguished Senator from Nebraska is almost 240million To the Senator from Montana the distinguished chairman of theFinance Committee my dear friend that is 60 million in Montana andNevada where the distinguished majority leader lives the chart thathas been provided to me by the Senator 263 millionWe have Senator Cornyn sitting right behind me here Senator Cornynyou are in the 68 billion category for Texas I might ask theSenator What is going to happen if you get cut 68 billion in regardto home health care service  We could go back and back sirI do not careand thenforth and forth    The Senator from Nebraska hasalready pointed out what happens in Nebraska and I know what willhappen in Kansas Nearly twothirds of Kansas home health care agencieswill have negative margins within only 5 years probably 2 or 3 ifthese cuts are allowed to occurHow are these agencies supposed to stay in business with these kindsof cuts The home health care benefit will be worthless to a KansasMedicare patient whose home health care agencies will go out ofbusiness So yes in fact this bill will effectively cut benefitsAgain get rid of the smokescreenThis doesnt apply just to the home health care benefit The same canbe said for the effect of the cuts as demonstrated by the Senator fromNebraska for reimbursements to hospitals This bill is going to costthe Kansas Hospital Association 15 billion They have some outsideexperts who came in I asked them What is going to be the effect ofthe cuts They already have cuts They only get reimbursed 70 percentnow and 15 billion on top of that We ought to have a chartand Iam sure we will have a chartthat would show Iowa or Nebraska or anyState here Texas especially because of the number of folks there Sohospitals hospices skilled nursing facilities and all of the restI want every senior to know that while maybe it is technicallyaccurate again for my friends across the aisle to claim this billdoesnt cut Medicare benefits there is no wayno wayyou can slash12 trillion from payments to providers without affecting theirability to keep their door open especially in rural and small townAmerica Seniors should know they will be left with a worthlessbenefit To paraphrase my friend Senator Alexander from Tennessee itwould be like having a bus ticket without a busThank you Senator Johanns Thank you for the work you are doingThank you for this motion I hope we are successful I hope people willwake up and understand the severity of what these cuts will do I urgeevery Member of this Senate to support Senator Johanns when we come toa vote on this issueThank you Mr President I yield the floorThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Kaufman The Senator from Montana isrecognized
S_TX_CORNYN,2009-12-04,8 billionwould cut not just into the muscle but into the bone and deny a lot ofelderly people particularly in rural areas access to care entirely  President I think as the American people arelistening to the debate we are having on health care reform they arebeing asked to accept some pretty implausible claims One claim is thatwe can take 12 trillion out of Medicare and it would not have anyimpact on the delivery of services to Medicare beneficiaries12trillionI think the biggest mistake about the way this bill is paid for withthe huge tax increases and huge cuts in Medicare is the proposal totake 12 trillion out of Medicare including 40 billion out of homehealth care in order to pay for a brandnew entitlement program whenwe already know Medicare itself is on a fiscally unsustainable pathI want to talk primarily about another aspect of these cuts and thatis the 11 million seniors including 532000 Texans who will losebenefits under their Medicare Advantage Program because these are notinconsequential cuts in their benefits They are serious I want totalk about some real human beings some real Texans who are going tobe affected in a negative way by these cutsFirst of all I think it is absolutely critical for the Americanpeople to understand that Medicare itself does not provide completecoverage to seniors That is why so many seniors end up buyingsupplemental insurance coverageMedigap coverage as it is sometimescalledin order to get their bills paid for Medicare only pays onaverage about 80 percent to providers of what private health insurancedoes That is the reason without additional compensation many doctorswill not see a new Medicare patient They simply cannot do it and keeptheir doors open to their other patientsThe truth is Medicare Advantage was created to fix some of the flawswith Medicare fee for service to give seniors more affordable andbetter coordinated health care None of us are standing up saying theproposed bill is all bad because some of the positive developments inthe bill call for greater coordination of health careOn balance it makes things worse than it does better because ofthese cuts in things such as Medicare AdvantageThe President of the United States has said providing Americans witha choice of quality affordable health care was a guiding principle forhim I agree with that statement of principle Medicare Advantage wascreated for that very purpose because as I said Medicare itself doesnot always work well for patientsWhere I live in Austin TX which is Travis County the last time Isaw a report only 17 percent of physicians will see a new Medicarepatient because Medicare reimbursement rates are so low Those problemsare avoided in large part by Medicare Advantage because it paysphysicians and providers better than Medicare fee for serviceAccording to the American Medical Associations 2008 national healthinsurance report card Medicarenot private health insurancebutMedicare had the highest percentage and the largest number of deniedmedical claims In fact Medicare denied 10 times more medical claimsthan private health insurers That is another reason why seniorsdeserve a choice between Medicare and private plans that will offerthem better benefitsAs I mentioned today 11 million Americans made that choice ofbetter benefits and better care coordination through the MedicareAdvantage Program The proposed bill the Reid bill will take awaythose choices and the benefits of those 11 million seniors by cuttingabout 120 billion from the programMany of our friends across the aisle will say we can cut 120 billionout of Medicare Advantage and it will have no impact on delivery ofservices But the Director of the Congressional Budget Office disagreeswith them who says their additional benefits will be cut roughly inhalfWe need to set the record straight on these socalled overpaymentsallegedly going to insurance company profits It is simply a falsestatement It is not true Our colleagues know the socalledoverpayments to Medicare Advantage plans do not go into those plansThey go to seniors in the form of additional benefits That is becauseunder Federal law 75 percent of additional payments to MedicareAdvantage plans are used to provide seniors with additional benefitsbenefits which they would not get under Medicare fee for servicebenefits such as chronic care management hearing aids eyeglasses andthe like The other 25 percent of any extra payments is returned to theFederal GovernmentLets be clear Cuts to Medicare Advantage would be taking awayseniors health care benefits for those 11 million seniors As Imentioned 12 million Texans are on Medicare Advantage and the Reidbill would cut their benefits by well over half You do not have totake my word for it Listen to what the CBO Director Dr Elmendorfsaid when Senator Crapo asked him during a Finance Committee hearingHe saidSo approximately half of the additional benefit would belost to those current Medicare Advantage policy holdersDirector ElmendorfFor those who would be enrolled otherwise under currentlaw yesNearly one out of every four seniors in Texas would lose about 122 amonth in health care benefits to create a new 25 trillion entitlementthat their grandchildren will ultimately have to end up paying for And122 a month may not sound like a lot for people inside the beltwaybut a couple from my hometown of San Antonio recently wrote to mePlease vote to leave our Medicare Advantage plans alone Wecant afford anything else as our portfolio was wiped out inthe stock market collapse last year My wife and I have hadto go back to work and we are in our seventiesYet this bill would impose another 122permonth cut in theirbenefitsAnother constituent of mine from Conroe TX wrotePlease do what you can to protect the Medicare Advantageplans Im on one and it has been beneficial to me It hassaved me an enormous amount of money and given me thebenefits Ive neededSome groups that support these cuts to Medicare Advantage have aconflict of interest to say the least because the benefits undertraditional fee for service as I mentioned for Medicare is about 80percent of what private insurance will pay In order to get coveragein order to pay the bills many seniors have had to buy additionalinsurancecoverage For 11 million seniors Medicare Advantage provides thosebenefitsFor many seniors former employers sometimes provide wraparoundplans For retired military TRICARE provides a wraparound plan Formany lowincome seniors Medicaid helps with cost sharing and premiumsFor many other seniors they purchase a standalone Medigap policyWe heard from our friends across the aisle about AARPs endorsementof the Medicare cuts in the Reid bill If it sounds odd that a seniorsadvocacy group would support taking nearly 12 trillion from analready near bankrupt program it shouldThe fact is as the Washington Post noted on October 27   But not advertised in this lobbying campaign have beenAARPs substantial earnings from insurance royalty and thepotential benefits that could come its way from many of thereform proposals    Democratic proposals to slashreimbursements for another program called MedicareAdvantage are widely expected to drive up demand for privateMedigap policies like the ones offered by AARP according tohealth care experts legislative aides and documentsSo AARP the socalled seniors advocacy group is advocating for acut in benefits to 11 million beneficiaries of Medicare Advantage Thesuggestion is one reason they would do so is because they will profitfrom this bill because these seniors will if they can afford it haveto go out and buy Medigap coverage from lo and behold entities suchas AARPThe fact is Medicare Advantage allows private plans to innovatebetter and provides better coordinated care for seniors Groups such asthe KelseySeybold Clinic in Houston TX which is basically not seeingMedicare feeforservice patients but is seeing Medicare Advantagepatients because they can afford to coordinate care the kinds ofthings we know they ought to be doing to provide better care but theycannot afford to do it on the feeforservice MedicareWe have had the Medicare Program around for more than 40 years Thefact is government bureaucrats are still trying to get the complexreimbursement formulas right We know as the distinguished chairman ofthe Finance Committee has said that under the feeforservice programwhich is part of what needs to be reformed in this health care billMedicare pays for volume and not valueSome of the positive things which I have complimented the bill on isit includes some small steps to change our current payforvolumeprogram to a payforvalue approach through various delivery systemreform demonstration programsThe irony is Medicare did not think of these delivery systemreforms rather Washington is finally catching up on what privatesector innovators have been doing for years We heard the distinguishedSenator from Minnesota talk about the Mayo Clinic The Mayo Clinic hasbeen doing that I mentioned KelseySeybold in Texas But privatesector innovators have been doing this through the Medicare AdvantageProgram alreadyThe delivery system reforms in the Reid bill would allow Medicare toexperiment with different approaches to changing physician incentivessuch as accountable care organizations or physician quality reportinginitiativesWill they work I happen to think they will We do know privatesector innovators have already figured out how to change physicianincentives in the sorts of ways we ought to be doing more of and notpunishing by cutting Medicare AdvantageOne Medicare Advantage plan HealthSpring serves 20000 seniors inmy State They have been a leader for changing incentives forphysicians to focus on quality rather than quantity I met with theirleadership and heard how they have done it What they told me is theyhave a collaborative partnership with their physicians They call itPartnership for Quality Physicians are accountable for both cost andquality based on an evidencebased set of quality measuresThe results are a winwin better quality care leading to healthierseniors and physicians who succeed in meeting evidencebased qualitystandards and ultimately lower health care costs which I thought wassupposed to be one of the goals of health care reformParticipating physicians were paid financial incentives for meetingtheir goal but as a result of coordination of care and evidencebasedquality standards they actually ended up charging less and patientsexperienced better results too Members needed fewer hospitalizationsand emergency room visits Preventive measures increased mammograms by80 percent diabetic foot exams by 360 percent and flu vaccinations by246 percentI have heard about HealthSprings success from a couple in FarmersBranch TX who recently wrote to me They saidWe had a Medicare supplemental policy for several yearsuntil they priced themselves out of the market We are nowwith a Medicare Advantage plan called HealthSpring We havebeen very happy with this plan and the way they are saving usmoney Please do not change or eliminate this programLet me tell you about one other Texas company called WellMed Whilethe Reid bill would finally give Medicare the ability to experimentwith medical homes and care coordination a San Antoniobased companya Medicare Advantage company called WellMed has been using a medicalhome model to coordinate patient care and emphasize prevention fornearly 20 yearsTo quote from an article last month in Inside San AntonioThe health care delivery model at WellMed puts the patientat the center of a team directed by a primary care physicianThe team may include a nurse health coach hospitalistsocial service worker and physician assistantAccording to WellMed CEO Dr George Rapier We really dohave to bring back the oldtime primary care doctor who caredfor you who was concerned about you who was part of yourfamily and you were part of their family Its a primarycare physician who knows all about you So if you need aspecialist they know the best specialist to send you to Ifyou need to go in the hospital they make sure you get theappropriate care in the hospital They are your coordinatorof care And thats really the concept of a medical homeThere is no question in my mind that the model has been saving livesin my State Here is a story about one Texan whose life was saved byphysicians caring for him at WellMedFor years Crohns disease weakenedWe will call him EdEds immune system and left him susceptible to infectionsOne morning in 2001 he lacked energy to even get out of bedHis breathing became labored He developed a cough thatsounded wetHis worried wife called his primary care physician atWellMed Dr Marlene Sanchez who wanted Ed hospitalizedimmediately so she could order a nuclear scan of his lungsHe protestedShe told me that if he refused to go I should call 911and have the paramedics come get him his wife Annetterecalled He heard Dr Sanchez talking to me the urgencyin her voice and that convinced him to goThe scan confirmed Dr Sanchezs suspicions A potentiallyfatal blood clot had traveled from Eds leg to his lungs Hewas successfully treated and recovered Ed and his wiferecently celebrated Eds 74th birthdayAnnette credits Dr Sanchez for saving Eds life and foracting as a catalyst that keeps him thriving in their goldenyearsWe have seen an abundance of doctors from the cancerdoctors to the dermatologist gastroenterologist the blooddoctor the heart specialistEd has gone through it all   and theyve all been coordinated by his primary caredoctor Ive been to other doctors outside WellMed and youdont get the feeling that they are communicating likethisWell many Texas seniors currently enjoy these extra benefits underMedicare Advantage such asanother benefitthe Silver Sneakersprogram the Nations leading exercise program for older AmericansThis past year one of the Silver Sneakers members personally visitedmy office to deliver testimonials from other Silver Sneakers membersOne Texan saidAt my age I need a program to strengthen me all over butprimarily to help me with my balance and coordination I needthese skills to keep me from falling and breaking my bonesAnother participant in the Silver Sneakers program saidI am 66 have been in the Silver Sneakers program a yearPrior to that I led a sedentary life which included manyhealth problems I had hypertension high cholesterolchronic bladder condition and mild depression Since comingto classes and utilizing the weights and cardio machines mylife has improved immensely My blood pressure has droppedmy cholesterol has beenlowered my chronic bladder condition has improved and I justfeel better all around I am no longer depressed because Ilook better and look forward to going to class and visitingwith my friendsThese cuts in Medicare Advantage are going to have a direct impact onthe benefits my constituents in Texas are benefiting fromthe 532000Texans who are currently on Medicare Advantageand what they areasking mewhich I cant answeris why in the world would we want tocut Medicare Advantage which actually works as opposed to Medicarefee for service which does not work well Why would we take a fiscallyunsustainable program such as Medicare which is going insolvent in2017 and use that to create a 25 trillion new entitlement programMy constituents the seniors who have paid into Medicare all theseyears are saying It is not fair to take the money we have paid intoMedicare and use it to create yet another entitlement program and notto fix Medicare itself So I believe we need to fix Medicares nearly38 trillion in unfunded liabilities We need to fix the improperpayment rate of roughly 1 out of every 10 Medicare dollars whichresults in somewhere on the order of a minimum of 60 billion offraudulent payments each year We need to put it on a fiscallysustainable path rather than taking 12 trillion from Medicare foranother illconceived Washington health care takeoverI dont believe my constituents believe you can take 12 trillionout of these programs just as they do not believe you can take morethan 100 billion out of Medicare Advantage and it will have no impacton their benefits They dont buy it They dont believe it and Idont eitherMr President I yield the floor
S_NJ_MENENDEZ,2009-12-11, What is the pending business before the SenateI rise about a program funded in that conference report It is aprogram that we put under the framework of Cuba broadcasting It issurrogate broadcasting into a closed society a society for which theState controls all information or attempts to control all informationto its 11 million citizens It is a part of a long tradition of theUnited States with the Voice of America type of broadcasting theeffort to try to bring a free flow of information into countries in theworld which are governed by despotic rulers We did this successfullyin the former Soviet Union We did it successfully in Eastern Europeand during the changes in the Czech Republic then CzechoslovakiaPoland the Solidarity movement and many others We have been proud ofthat history of bringing the free flow of information We now try touse it in different parts of the world based on the new challenges wehaveOne of those places in the world in which we do this surrogatebroadcasting is into the island of Cuba because it has a repressiveregime that will not allow the free flow of information to go to itspeople We have a program called Radio and Television Marti Marti issort of like the George Washington of Cuba It is named after himIn 1983 Congress passed the Radio Broadcasting to Cuba Act toprovide the people of Cuba through Radio Marti with information theCuban Government would try to censor and keep from them Subsequentlyin 1990 Congress authorized US television broadcasting to Cubathrough Radio and Television Marti to support the right of the Cubanpeople to receive information and ideas they would not normallyreceive It opened radio and television broadcasting to Cuba provideda consistently reliable and authoritative source of accurateobjective and comprehensive news commentary and other informationabout events in Cuba and elsewhere It did so to promote the cause offreedom inside of CubaWe know there is a long history of repressive regimes trying to blockour surrogate broadcasting around the world They just dont simply sitback and say Send it all in Let me accept whatever it is you aresending in That is not their effort Their effort is to block And ourdifficulty with broadcasting has never been a justification for cuttingfunding for these programs We have never submitted to the propositionthat when a regime tries to block our surrogate broadcastingwhetherit was Voice of America Radio Free Europe all of those efforts therewas always blocking taking placethat that is a cause or justificationfor cutting funding It should not be a different standard nowI ask when it comes to Cuba broadcasting why the double standardIn fact especially now when change is coming to Cuba it is in ourinterest to have the capacity to broadcast information to the CubanpeopleI want to show one of the charts that may be a little difficult backat home but these are actual photographs which came from a January2009 Government Accountability Office report which were provided by anorganization that reports on Cuban affairs It depicts evidence ofCubans ability to watch Television Marti despite Cuban jammingefforts These pictures were taken from inside of Cuba They may not bethe best picture quality although I doubt they have digital televisioninside of Cuba But nonetheless they have the ability to see itThere are other pictures of Cubans Here is a picture of a group ofindividuals who in fact are part of an effort to create a librarysystem something as fundamental in the United States as a free publiclibrary There isnt that in Cuba at least not a free public libraryThey control what books might be found thereSo these groups try to create information One of the things they dois again to be able to have accessas shown in this picture This isa panel that is talking on Television Marti Here in this picture isa young child watching a Marti program inside of Cuba You can see thelogo here of Marti TVAs shown in this picture this was a special that was broadcast intoCuba and was seen in Cuba on the Reverend Dr Martin Luther King on thewhole issue of peaceful nonviolent changeas a message to the Cubanpeople that in fact these things could be achievedNow you can see at the bottom of these picturesit is a little hardto seebut here is the Marti logo that is seen on the bottom righthand corner on several of these photographsThis came from that Government Accountability Office report AJanuary 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office noted thefollowingThe Broadcasting Board of Governorswhich is the oversight we haveas the Federal Governmentand the Office of Cuba Broadcasting and theUS Interests Section in Havanawhich in essence is we do not havean Embassy there because we do not have relations but we have anInterests Section therethat Cuba officials emphasized that they facesignificant challenges in conducting valid audience research due to theclosed nature of Cuban societyUS government officials stationed in Havana are prohibited by theCastro regime from traveling outside of HavanaWe know it is difficult to travel to Cuba for the purpose ofconducting audience research We know the threat of Cuban Governmentsurveillance and reprisals for interviewers and respondents raisesconcerns about respondents willingness to answer sensitive questionsfranklyIn this January 2009 Government Accountability Report US officialsindicated that research on Radio and TV Martis audience size facessignificant limitations For example none of the data isrepresentative of the entire Cuban population Telephone surveys arethe only random data collection effort in Cuba but it might not berepresentative of Cubas media habits for several reasons But here aretwo of the main onesFirst only adults in homes with published telephone numbers aresurveyed According to Broadcasting Board of Governors documentsapproximately 17 percent of Cuban adults live in households withpublished household numbers That means that 83 percent of thepopulation does not have a published telephone numberSecond the Board of Governors and the Office of Cuba Broadcastingofficials noted that because individuals inCuba are discouraged or prohibited by their government from listeningto and watching US international broadcasts they might be fearful ofresponding to media surveys and disclosing their media habitsIf I am told that it is illegal for me simply to watch theprogramming of some international organization and that I can go tojail for listening to that programming then ultimatelythenultimatelyam I going to be truthful to some telephone survey aboutDid I watch TV Marti Did I listen to Radio MartiMr President I know about this personally Years ago when I was inthe House of Representatives while I had an aunt who was still aliveat the time who I had asked never to acknowledge me as her nephewwhich she agreed toin my second term however she was listening tome on Radio Marti and in a moment of pride she said Oh thatMenendez is my nephewUnfortunately she said it in front of some visitors who she thoughtwere her friends One of them was part of El Comite de Defensa de laRevolucion which means The Committee to Defend the Revolution ablock watch organization in every city in every village in everyhamlet inside Cuba whose only job is to go and spy on their neighborsand tell the state security who speaks ill or does something againstthe regimeUnfortunately for that simple act of speaking out saying to afriend Oh that Menendez is my nephew my aunt suffered seriousconsequencesSo the audience size might very well be larger than the surveyresults would indicate because people are fearful to say Yes I amlistening to Radio and Television Marti because I cannot do that andnot face the consequences of a regime that would arrest meRadio and TV Marti have a larger audience in Cuba Why do I say thatBecause a 2007 survey that the Office of Cuba Broadcastingcommissioned intended to obtain information on programming preferencesand media habits also contained data on Radio and TV Martis audiencesizeWhile the survey was not intended to measure listening rates orproject audience size this nonrandom survey of 382 Cubans who hadrecently arrived in the United Statesso now they were free to saywhat they actually did back at home because they were not subject tobeing arrested simply for listening to Radio and Television Martifound that 45 percent of all of those respondents reported listening toRadio Marti and that over 21 percent reported watching TV Marti withinthe last 6 months before leaving CubaSo I rise because I want to bring this data this information thisperspective to the debateI am happy to see the very deep cuts that were made to the Office ofCuba Broadcasting that contains both Radio and Television Marti havelargely been restored That is one of the reasons I felt willing tovote to proceed with the omnibus billOne of the bodys greatest strengths is the ability to freely debateissues in an open format issues on which in the end we mightcompletely disagree but issues that need to be brought into clearfocus for the American peopleHowever when I see my colleagues drawing conclusions on their ownwithout reasonable data to support those conclusions I feel compelledto come and present an alternative perspective of the factsWhy is this important to us The United States is a beacon of lightof freedom and democracy around the world The promotion of democracyand human rights has always been one of the pillars of our foreignpolicyYesterday was Human Rights Day which is the day that marks theanniversary of the United Nations Assemblys adoption of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights in 1948 It is recognized every year onDecember 10Yesterday in the midst of the recognition of this day in Havana wesaw the brutal Castro regime cracking down on people just because theywere trying to exercise their right for peaceful demonstration We sawpeople beaten arrested and forcibly detainedThere is a group of ladies they call themselves the Ladies in WhiteThey are mothers and sisters and friends of jailed dissidents inside ofCuba So these are people of imprisoned family memberstheir son ortheir daughter their brother or sister their friendsand the onlyreason those people are in jail is because they have pursued peacefulmeans to try to create change inside of their own country They mayhave said something They may have worn a white band that sayscambio which means change They may have simply uttered thefact that What we need is change inside of CubaSo these Ladies in Whitethey dress fully in white so that in factit is a form of being noticed but again a peaceful formheld longstem flowers and miniature Cuban flags They were attacked by hundredsof angry progovernment demonstrators who sought to drown out theirchants of freedom by yelling this street belongs to FidelNow in Cuba these groups are not spontaneous It is not thecitizenry It is something called rapid response brigades They arestate security dressed as civilians whose purpose is to make it seemthat the populous is against the human rights activists and politicaldissidents But ultimately they are state security agents who act ina way to make it seem quite different But they are thugsMr President the reason the regime organizes protests in this wayis so if you orchestrate a protest where it looks like its citizensare protesting against each other then the regime can deny in factany role in the eventHowever we know very well the role the Castro regime plays in thesedemonstrations Especially in light of the events of yesterday andtoday we know the Castro regime is a brutal totalitarian dictatorshipthat continues to violate the most basic human rights continues tocrush debate and crush dialogYesterday I came to the floor as part of my concerns and I spokeabout this gentleman and his wife as shown in this picture I spokeabout Jorge Luis Garcia Perez Antunez This is a gentleman whosaid while standing in a plaza in his hometown which is in the centerof Havanait is not where the tourists go not on the beaches ofHavana it is in the heart of Havanahe said what we need is the typeof change we saw in Eastern EuropeFor that simple statement he was thrown into jail for 17 years17years He came out a couple years ago but he has not changed He hasnot changed his views or his effort to create human rightsHe issued a public letter that I read yesterday an Englishtranslation of a public letter he wrote to the present dictator RaulCastro the brother of Fidel Castro and he said many things I am notgoing to read the whole letter again but he said things like Let meask you a few questions that I think are importantWith what right do the authorities without a prior crimebeing committed detain and impede the free movement of theircitizens in violation of a universally recognized rightThe very rights that are being observed in that international HumanRights Day of the Universal Declaration of Human RightsWhat feelings could move a man like Captain Idel GonzalezMorfi to beat my wife a defenseless woman so brutallycausing lasting effects to her bones for the sole act ofarriving at a radio station to denounce with evidence thetorture that her brotherHer brother this is his wife shown in the picturereceived in a Cuban prisonI spoke about him yesterday and his letter What happened today MrPresidentToday the day after Human Rights Day and the day after I read hisletter into the Record and 2 days after he presented that letter toRaul Castro he was arrested again by the regime and arbitrarilydetained with his wife and another activistWhat is his crime That I read a letter in the US Senate about hiscalls for freedom and democracy And the day after the recognition ofinternational human rights he gets arrested today and his wife getsarrested todayor detained today I am not sure He got arrested forsureTV Marti is one of the many efforts the US Government rightlyinvests in to try to reach the Cuban people with information to try toreach the people who were beaten today and yesterday and for decadessimply for trying to demonstrate peacefully to speak their mind towalk in peace and in remembrance of their loved ones they lost underthe clenched fists of this regimeI feel badly that the day after I spoke about Mr Antunez he ends upin jail So we need to have a spotlight just as we did for AleksandrSolzhenitsyn in the Soviet Union just as we did for Vaclav Havel as hewas trying to create change for the Czech Republic just as we did withLech Walesa when he was having the Solidarnosc Movement inside PolandFor some reason I cant get anybody to come to this floor and talkabout the human rights violations inside Cuba I hear a lot aboutLets trade with Cuba lets do business with Cuba lets travel toCuba but God I never hear anyone talking about these human rightsactivists like the Lech Walesas the Vaclav Havels the AleksandrSolzhenitsyns of that other timeThis man got arrested today simply because yesterday we made hisletter public That is the Castro regime that I know not theromanticism of what some people have about what goes on at that islandSo I am pleased the Office of Cuba Broadcasting has made efforts overthe last year to reevaluate the programs they are carrying out andcarefully consider creative ways to reach the Cuban people They havedone this with Television Marti They will continue to do this withother programs I would expect nothing less The kind of evaluationshould continue We should constantly strive to tailor our programs soour investments are reaching those who truly need our help investmentsthat are advancing US foreign policy interests the nationalinterests of the United States and the national security interests ofthe United StatesI have a declaration that came out of Cuba of over 100 human rightsactivists inside Cuba who are in support of the efforts of the UnitedStates as it relates to the surrogate broadcasting that goes into Cubafrom Radio and Television Marti This broadcasting provides some freeflow of information of what is happening in the rest of the world aswell as what is happening inside Cuba Because that is part of what wehelp here to let those who otherwise would not know because of aclosed society and a dictatorship that rules with an iron fist what ishappening even inside their own country what is happening to peoplesuch as Mr Antunez what is happening to the ladies in white who areprotesting peacefully about their loved ones in jail With that letter of over 100 human rights activists isthe recognition that we will not let up for Mr Antunez and therecognition that there are voices who will continue to speak out forthe human rightsThe last point I wish to make imagine if you were sitting in a gulagsomewhere if you were beaten simply because you had a few words to sayabout creating change peacefully in your own country imagine if youcould be swept away by security police and taken to some jail and maybenot seen for years after that Would you not want someone somewhere inthe world to be standing and speaking for you I would and that iswhat I try to do on this floorWith that I yield the floor  President I ask unanimous consent that after anyleader remarks

S_WI_FEINGOLD,2009-12-11, President the massive unamendable spending billbefore the Senate includes three bills that the Senate never had achance to consider and is chockfull of earmarks At a time of recordbudget deficits we should be showing our constituents that we areserious about fiscal responsibility Instead of controlling spendingthis bill represents business as usual in CongressMr DeMINT Mr President I rise today to address a questionsubmitted to me from the good Senator from Illinois as to whether theDC Opportunity Scholarship Program will in fact end after this year Inorder to respond to my colleague I would like to highlight aparticular section of the Financial Services and General GovernmentAppropriations Act of 2010 that funds the District of ColumbiasbudgetIn title IV which explains how the District of Columbia is fundedit states that 132 million will indeed be provided for opportunityscholarships for existing students in the DC Opportunity ScholarshipProgram However the very next line clearly states that the funds areto remain available until expended which means that the programwill eventually be phased out and terminated once the funding forcurrent students is exhausted Students in the program will slowly bephased out over time unable to avail themselves of future educationalopportunities currently given to them through this programThe DC Opportunity Scholarship Program which has the overwhelmingsupport of DC residents parents Mayor Adrian Fenty ChancellorMichelle Rhee former Mayor Anthony Williams and a majority of the DCCity Council has now been mandated a slow death by House and Senateappropriators This scholarship program which gives students ofWashington DCs poorest families a chance at a quality education hasnow effectively been terminated since there is only funding availablefor existing scholarships and existing students and not for futurescholarships and future studentsBy funding this program in such a manner in the omnibus Congress isultimately signaling the beginning of the end for this scholarshipprogram By disallowing future students to take part the size of theprogram will shrink year after year and will deny entry to siblings ofexisting participantspunishing many who have been waiting in line forthis tremendous opportunity Additionally the federal evaluation ofthis program will be compromised as the numbers of participantsdiminishes making it difficult for administrators to evaluate theeffectiveness of the programThe fact that this administration continues to claim that the DCOpportunity Scholarship Program is not being terminated is yet anotheract of deception on their part to the American people The Presidentwho himself is a recipient of a K12 educational scholarship hasrefused to stand up for children in our Nations Capital and fight forthe same educational opportunities afforded to him and his familyaright he exercises now as he practices school choice with his ownchildren  President last month the United Nations Group ofExperts on the Democratic Republic of Congo presented its latest reportto the UN Security Council Over the years the Group of Experts hasconducted critical investigations into violations of the sanctions andthe UN arms embargo toward Congo as well as human rights abuses andthe linkages between natural resource exploitation and the financing ofillegal armed groups Yet too often the Group of Experts reports andrecommendations have not resulted in action by the Security Councilandor UN member states I hope it will be different with thisreport especially since it identifies a number of concrete stepsthrough which UN member states can address the financial and supportnetworks that fuel the violence in eastern CongoThis new Group of Experts report particularly focuses on the FDLRthe armed group comprising many former Rwandan genocidaires that is atthe heart of the instability in eastern Congo It documents how thisgroup continues to benefit from residual but significant supportfrom top commanders of the Congolese military It also documents howthis group is supported by a farreaching international Diasporanetwork Based on records of satellite phones the Group of Expertsfound that the FDLR commanders frequently communicate with people intwentyfive different countries in Europe North America and AfricaThe report also mentions credible reports and testimony that the FDLRis using Burundi as a rear base for regrouping and recruitmentpurposesTo address these continued support networks the Group of Expertsrecommends that UN member states direct their respective lawenforcement and security agencies to conduct investigations and sharerelevant information on FDLR Diaspora members providing materialsupport to the group The Group also calls on member states toprosecute violations of the sanctions regime by their nationals orleaders of armed groups that are currently residing within theircountries The report cites three such leaders who have resided inFrance and Germany With regard to the Congolese military the Grouprecommends that the Security Council require member states to notifyand get approval from the Sanctions Committee for all deliveries ofmilitary equipment and provision of training to Congo This would helpensure that international assistance is not contributing to abusivebehavior or going to units of the military believed to be colludingwith armed groupsBuilding on its previous reports the Group of Experts report alsoshows how the FDLR and other armed groups continue to benefit from theexploitation of natural resources According to this Groupsinvestigations the FDLR continues to get millions of dollars in directfinancing from gold and cassiterite reserves in eastern Congo Thereport illustrates how gold from eastern Congo is smuggled out toUganda and Burundi and then travels on to the United Arab Emirates andultimately international markets Similarly the report documents howformer rebels of the CNDPwho have ostensibly become part of theCongolese militarycontinue to control and exploit mineralrich areasIn fact two of the most lucrative mining sites are reportedlycontrolled by units of the Congolese military that are composed almostexclusively of former CNDP units This is especially worrying in thecontext of the CNDPs integration into the Congolese military which isstill extremely fragileI have long called for action to address the armed exploitation ofCongos minerals which fuels this conflict I was pleased to join withSenators Brownback and Durbin earlier this year to introduce the CongoConflict Minerals Act S 891 which would commit the United States toaddress this issue comprehensively And I was glad that SecretaryClinton spoke about this issue during her visit to Congo in August Asthe Group of Experts report makes clear armed groups will continue toexploit the regions rich mineral base as long as it is profitable TheGroup of Experts recommends that member states take necessary measuresto clarify the due diligence obligations of companies under theirrespective jurisdictions that operate with these minerals The Groupalso calls for the Congolese government to establish an independentmonitoring team with international support to conduct spot checks ofmines and mineral trading routesI am glad that there is increasing outrage about what is happening ineastern Congo It is the single deadliest conflict since the SecondWorld War and millions have been displaced from their homes forced tolive in squalid conditions Countless women and girls and some men andboys in the Congo have endured rape and sexual violence But ouroutrage means little unless it translates into concrete actions tofundamentally change the situation in Congo We need to finally getserious about addressing the underlying issues that make this warprofitable and allow it to persist The Group of Experts has provided aclear picture of some of those issues as well as specific ways thatUN member states can address them including within our own nationaljurisdictions I applaud the Group for its courageous work I stronglyhope that the Security Council will pursue the reportsrecommendations and I urge the Obama administration to lead the way inthis respect  President our government agencies collect andreport a range of economic information but much of what we see or hearis most suited to describing the general state of the countryseconomy This information does not reflect what is happening in andwhat matters most to our families and the quality of our lives Forexample our national unemployment figures dont tell us that those whoare employed may not have benefits or that they are working two orthree jobs to earn the income that they report or that their mortgagedebt and college loans are jeopardizing their ability to repay theircredit card debt or their medical bills By knowing and reporting thiskind of information we can not only more accurately reflect what ourfamilies are experiencing economically we can better informpolicymakers about what matters most to people and the steps that needto be taken to address household economic needs and concernsTo address this need I am reintroducing the Commission on Measuresof Household Economic Security Act of 2009 The bill would establish abipartisan congressional commission of 8 economic experts to look atexisting government economic data and identify the possible need fornew information more accurate methodologies and better ways to reportthese economic measures to give a more accurate and reliable picture ofthe economic well being of American households As part of theireffort the Commission will be asked to meet with representative groupsof the public so that their views are taken into account in theCommissions recommendationsIn doing this the Commission will look at such things as the currentdebt situation of American individuals and households includingcategories of debt such as credit card debt education related loansand mortgage payments the movement of Americans between salaried jobswith benefits to single or multiple wage jobs with limited or nobenefits with a comparison of income to include the value of benefitsprograms such as health insurance and retirement plans the percentageof Americans who are covered by both employerprovided and individualhealth care plans and the extent of coverage per dollar paid by bothemployers and employees the savings rate including both standardsavings plans and pension plans the disparity in income distributionover time and between different demographic and geographic groups andthe breakdown of household expenditures between such categories asfood shelter medical expenses debt servicing and energyIn addition the Commission will consider the relevance of certainnonmarket activities like household production education andvolunteer services that affect the economic wellbeing of householdsbut are not measured or valued in currently reported economicstatistics As Robert F Kennedy famously said some of our economicindicators measure everything in short except that which makes lifeworthwhile We need to make an effort to value more than just ourgross domestic product and sales receipts We need to better measureand understand what matters to American householdsThis effort to improve how we measure what matters in our economy isvery much in the Wisconsin tradition of accountable good government Itwas Senator Robert LaFollette Jr who in 1932 introduced aresolution requiring the US Government to establish a morescientific specific and accurate set of measures of the health of theUS economy From his request Simon Kuznets a University ofPennsylvania economics professor developed the first set of nationalaccounts which form the basis for todays measure of GDP and othereconomic indicators Kuznets won the 1971 Nobel Prize in Economicsfor his empirically founded interpretation of economic growth whichhas led to new and deepened insight into the economic and socialstructure and process of development His work was the basis for muchof the New Deal reform policies Yet Kuznets specifically acknowledgedthat his measures were incomplete and did not go far enough to measurewhat may really matter In his 1934 report to the Senate on hiscompilation of statistics associated with Gross National Product heconcluded The welfare of a nation can    scarcely be inferredfrom a measurement of national income as so defined    Thisbill is intended to advance these earlier efforts to make our economicstatistical measures more reflective of the welfare of our families andour nationThe cost of this commission will be fully covered by amounts alreadyauthorized and appropriated to the Bureau of Labor Statistics I urgemy colleagues to support my legislationBy Ms CANTWELL for herself and Ms CollinsS 2877 A bill to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to establisha programto regulate the entry of fossil carbon into commerce in the UnitedStates to promote clean energy jobs and economic growth and avoiddangerous

S_IA_GRASSLEY,2009-12-15, You cantdo that to us because we only have 812 minutes left on our side  President we have two key votes this afternoon ondrug reimportation These votes mean that today is the day we can showthe American people whether we can pass drug importation or whether theSenate will give it lipservice and nothing elseWe have heard on the Senate floor the concerns that some have aboutdrug importation and whether it can be safe Everyone who knows meknows I care deeply about drug safety The fact is an unsafe situationis what we have today Today consumers are ordering drugs over theInternet from who knows where and the FDA does not have the resourcesin fact to do much of anything about it The fact is legislation tolegalize importation would not only help to lower the cost ofprescription drugs for all Americans but also should shut down theunregulated importation of drugs from foreign pharmacies the situationwe have today The Dorgan amendment in fact would improve drugsafety not threaten it It would open trade to lower cost drugsIn 2004 my staff was briefed about an investigation that thePermanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate GovernmentalAffairs Committee conducted That subcommittee conducted thisinvestigation into what we would call going on right now current drugimportation They found about 40000 parcels containing prescriptiondrugs come through the JFK mail facility every single day of the year40000 packages each dayNow the JFK airport houses the largest international mail branch inthe United States but even then that is the tip of the icebergAccording to this subcommittee each day 30000 packages of drugs enterthe US through Miami 20000 enter through Chicago That is another50000 more packages each and every dayWhat is worse about 28 percent of the drugs coming in are controlledsubstances So we have a situation where we need the basic approach inthis amendment to assure that imported drugs are safe That is what theDorgan amendment is all about to give FDA the ability to verify thedrug pedigree back to the manufacturer to require FDA to inspectfrequently and to require fees to give the FDA the resources to dothatThe bottom line is the Dorgan amendment gives the FDA the authorityand the resources it needs to implement drug importation safelyCertainly the President knows that a great way to hold drugcompanies accountable is to allow safe legal drug importation I wouldlike to quote this President not when he was a candidate for Presidentbut a candidate for the Senate This is what President Obama said thenI urge my opponent to stop siding with the drugmanufacturers and put aside his opposition to thereimportation of lower priced prescription drugsNow we are hearing about the secret deal with big PhRMA That wasrevised just this week to solidify support with PhRMAs allies forkilling this very important Dorgan amendment The drug companies willstop at nothing to keep the United States closed to other markets inorder to charge higher pricesWith the Dorgan amendment we are working to get the job done Whatwe need is to make sure Americans have even greater more affordableaccess to wonder drugs by further opening the doors to competition inthe global pharmaceutical industryAmericans are waiting Too often this thing has been stymied and itlooks like there is another chance to stymie it Only I am surprisedMost of the time in the past that I have been for the importation ofdrugs it was my colleagues over here who were trying to stymie it Butnow it looks as though it is the other side We ought tohave a vast majority for this amendment I would be surprised It wouldbe a crime if we didntI yield the floor  I thank mygood friend for doing that I have a little different view on some ofthe things he said about taxes here I respect him giving me some timebecause we dont have time on this side It is nice his doing thatRepublicans and Democrats are working off of the same data providedby the Joint Committee on Taxation For some reason my friends on theother side of the aisle seem to want to read this data selectively soI wish to look at this data I want to stress this data is from thenonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation They are experts They arenonpolitical people who tell it like it isMy friends on the other side are correct in one thing This billprovides a tax benefit to a small group of Americans You can see righthere that this benefit is to the people here where the minus sign is infront of the numbers These numbers are in whiteAs I pointed out previously when you see a negative number on thischart the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us these people arereceiving a tax benefit This income categorythe income categorieswhere you see these negative numbers begin at zero and stretch to50000 for individuals and 75000 for families That will be 50000to 75000 I give my Democratic friends credit for being right on thispart of the data But I want to show you where I disagree with them andtheir choosing to overlook other parts of the data the data I willsoon refer to here on this chartWhen we see negative numbers on this chart as I have said the JointCommittee on Taxation is telling us that there is a tax benefit Soconversely where there are positive numbersthis will be an exampleof positive numbersthe Joint Committee on Taxation is telling usthese taxpayers are seeing a tax increase Those numbers I have alreadypointed to begin at 50000 for an individual and go up to 200000 foran individualWhen we see a positive number then it is the reverse The JointCommittee on Taxation is telling us these taxpayers are in fact seeingtax increases So if we see positive numbers for individuals makingmore than 50000 and we see positive numbers for families making morethan 75000 it is just this simple We know these peoples taxes aregoing to go upThe Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us that taxes for theseindividuals once again for a third time will go up under this 2074page Reid billThese individuals and families are making less than 200000 What issignificant about less than 200000 is that this violates what thePresident promised in his campaign that individuals who are middleclass under 200000 are not going to see one dime of tax increaseTo come to any different conclusion is saying that the data on thischartand of course the professionals at the Joint Committee onTaxationboth are wrong To come to any different conclusion is sayingthe chart produced by the Joint Committee on Taxation is wrongI yield the floor  President yesterday afternoon a few of my friendson the other side made some assertions about congressional historyfiscal policy and the role of bipartisan tax relief for the period of20012006 The speakers were the distinguished junior Senators fromVermont Ohio and Minnesota They are all passionate Members They arearticulate voices of the progressive as they term it or very liberalwing as those of us on this side term it portion of the SenateDemocratic CaucusI respect the passion they bring to their views But as one of themhas said frequently in his early months of Senate service we areentitled to our opinions but not entitled to our own facts I couldntagree more with that notion In order to insure an intellectuallyhonest standard of debate both sides need to correct the record whenthey feel the other side has misstated the facts It is in that spiritthat I respond todayI wont take this time to debate the merits of the surtax that theypropose as a substitute revenue raiser in this bill That can wait tillwe debate their amendment I am going to focus on their assertionsabout recent fiscal history and the role of bipartisan tax reliefBefore I address the revisionist fiscal history we heard I wouldlike to set the record straight on congressional historyIt was said yesterday afternoon that there were 8 years of a GeorgeW Bush administration and Republican Congress If the Members makingthese assertions would go back and check the records of the Senatethey would find that during that 8year period Republicans controlledthe Senate when it was evenly divided for a little over 5 months Foralmost half the month of January 2001 Democrats held the majoritybecause outgoing Vice President Gore broke ties For the balance of theperiod from January 20 2001 through June 6 2001 the Senate wasevenly divided but Republicans held because of Vice President Cheneystie breaking voteOn June 6 2001 the Democrats regained the majority when SenatorJeffords previously a Republican began caucusing with SenateDemocrats For the balance of 2001 2002 and in early 2003 Democratsheld the majorityFor two Congresses half of President Bushs term Republicans held amajority For the last 2 years of the George W Bush PresidencyDemocrats controlled both Houses of CongressWhen you add it up with the exception of a little over 4 months whenthe Senate was equally divided Democrats controlled the Senate forabout half the period of the George W Bush administrationWhen you hear some of our friends on the other side debate recentfiscal history these basic facts regarding political power andaccountability are obscured Perhaps it is their opinion that Democratswere not exercising majority power during that period but the fact isthat Democrats controlled the Senate for almost half the period of theGeorge W bush administrationNow lets turn to the fiscal history assertions from my friends onthe other side The revisionist history basically boils down to twoconclusions1 That all of the bipartisan tax relief enacted during that periodwas skewed to the top 1 percent or top twotenths of 1 percent oftaxpayers and2 That all of the bad fiscal history of this decade to date isattributable to the bipartisan tax relief plansNot surprisingly nearly all of the revisionists who spoke generallyoppose tax relief and support tax increases The same crew generallysupport spending increases and oppose spending cutsOn the first point two of the three speakers from the other sidevoted for the conference report for fiscal year 2010 budget resolutionThe third speaker was not a Member of this body at that time theconference report was adopted I am not aware however of hisopposition to that budget which was drawn up by the Senate DemocraticCaucusThat budget was similar to President Obamas first budget A coreportion of that budget much ballyhooed by the Democratic leadershipwas an extension of the major portion of the bipartisan tax reliefenacted during the period of 20012006 As a matter of fact roughly 80percent of the revenue loss from that legislation much criticized bythe three speakers yesterday afternoon is contained in the budget thattwo of them voted for Eighty percent is usually a pretty fairendorsement of any policy Again I have not heard the third speakerthe junior Senator from Minnesota indicate that he doesnt support thetax relief included in the Democratic budget Perhaps I missedsomething In addition the three speakers need to pay attention toanalyses from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on TaxationIf they did examine those analyses they would find that in terms ofthe burden of taxation the 2001 legislation redistributed the burdenfrom lower income taxpayers to higher income taxpayersNow I turn to the second fiscal revisionist history point Thatpoint is that all of the bad fiscal history of this decade to dateis attributable to the bipartisan tax relief plansIn the debate so far many on this side have pointed out some keyundeniable facts We agree with the President on one key fact ThePresident inherited a big deficit and a lot of debtThe antirecessionary spending together with lower tax receipts andthe TARP activities has set a fiscal table of a deficit of 12trillion That was on the Presidents desk when he took over the OvalOffice on January 20 2009 That is the highest deficit as apercentage of the economy in Post World War II historyNot a pretty fiscal picture And as predicted several months agothat fiscal picture got a lot uglier with the 787 billion stimulusbill So for the folks who saw that bill as an opportunity torecover America with government taking a larger share of theeconomy over the long term I say congratulationsFor those who voted for the stimulus bill including two of the threespeakers to which I refer they put us on the path to a bigger role forthe government Over a trillion dollars of new deficit spending washidden in that bill The Congressional Budget Office concluded that thepermanent fiscal impact of that bill totaled over 25 trillion over 10years It caused some of the extra red ink Supporters of that billneed to own up to the fiscal course they chartedNow to be sure after the other side pushed through the stimulusbill and the second half of the 700 billion of TARP money CBOreestimated the baseline A portion of this new red ink upfront isdue to that reestimateThe bottom line however is that reestimate occurred several weeksafter the President and robust Democratic majorities took over thegovernment Decisions were made and the fiscal consequences followedSome on the other side who raises this point about the March CBOreestimate That is fine But if they were to be consistent andintellectually honest then they would have to acknowledge the CBOreestimate that occurred in 2001 after President Bush took office Thesurplus went south because of economic conditions The 56 trillionnumber so often quoted by those on the other side was illusoryThe three members should go back and take a look at what CBO said atthe time According to CBO for the first relevant fiscal year the taxcut represented barely 14 percent of the total change in the budgetFor instance for the same period increased appropriations outrankedthe tax cut by 6 billion So spending above baseline together withlower projected revenues accounted for 86 percent of the change in thebudget picture Let me repeat that Bipartisan tax relief was aminimal 14percent factor in the change in the budget situationOver the long term the tax cut was projected to account for 45percent of the change in the budget picture Stated another way the10year surplus declined from 56 trillion to 16 trillion Of that40 trillion change the tax cut represented about 17 trillion ofthe declineLets take a look at the fiscal history before the financial meltdownhit That conclusion is again in this decade all fiscal problems areattributable to the widespread tax relief enacted in 2001 2003 2004and 2006In 2001 President Bush came into office He inherited an economythat was careening downhill Investment started to go flat in 2000 Thetechfueled stock market bubble was bursting Then came the economicshocks of the 911 terrorist attacksAdd in the corporate scandals to that economic environment And it istrue as fiscal year 2001 came to close the projected surplus turnedto a deficit I referred to the net effects of some of these unforeseenevents on the projected 56 trillion surplusNow yesterday afternoons three speakers may so oppose bipartisantax relief that they want to attribute all fiscal problems to the taxrelief The official scorekeepers show the facts to be differentThose on this side of the aisle have a different view than therevisionists In just the right time the 2001 tax relief plan startedto kick in The fiscal facts show as the tax relief hits its full forcein 2003 the deficits grew smaller They grew smaller in amount Theygrew smaller as a percentage of the economy This pattern continued upthrough 2007If my comments were meant to be partisan shots I could say thisfavorable fiscal path from 2003 to 2007 was the only period aside from6 months in 2001 where Republicans controlled the White House and theCongressBut unlike the fiscal history revisionists I am not trying to makeany partisan points I am just trying to get to the fiscal factsSo lets get the fiscal history rightIn this decade deficits went down after the tax relief plans wereput in full effect Deficits did start to trend back up after thefinancial meltdown hit I doubt the fiscal history revisionists whospoke yesterday would say that bipartisan tax relief was the cause ofthe financial meltdown So aside from that unrelated bad macroeconomicdevelopment the trend line showed revenues on the way back upBut that is the past We need to make sure we understand it But whatis most important is the future People in our States send us here todeal with future policy This budget debate should not be aboutDemocrats flogging Republicans and viceversa The people dont send ushere to flog one another like partisan cartoon cutout charactersover past policies They dont send us here to endlessly point fingersof blame Now lets focus on the fiscal consequences of the budgetthat is before the SenatePresident Obama rightly focused us on the future with his eloquenceduring the campaign Id like to take a quote from the Presidentsnomination acceptance speechWe need a President who can face the threats of the futurenot grasping at the ideas of the pastPresident Obama was rightWe need a President and I would add Congressmen and Senators whocan face the threats of the future The legislation before us ascurrently written poses considerable threats to our fiscal future Itis too important to dodge It is a bill that restructures onesixth ofthe economy It affects all of us and more importantly all of ourconstituentsGrasping at ideas of the past or playing the partisan blame game willnot deal with the threats to our fiscal future Lets face the honestfiscal facts Lets not revise fiscal history as we start this criticaldebate about the fiscal choices ahead of us The people who send ushere have a right to expect nothing less of us
S_AL_SESSIONS,2009-12-17, Reserving the right to object if I might if theSenator would propose her request again  Madam President it is very distressing that SenatorStabenow could not finish her remarks and that other Senators such asSenator Whitehouse and Senator Levin and Senator Lieberman have beenshorted of time Why Because for some reason the majority leaderfeels we should not go past 530 tonightThis is a defense bill and it is important We need to be talkingabout the good things that are in it and the things that have beenadded to it that are not so good I do not think working a few extrahours is going to hurt anybodyI hear colleagues complain that they cannot work a weekend theycannot work up to Christmas they cannot work at night Well whatabout our men and women who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan 7 daysa week 12 hours a day Christmas and holidays They are away fromtheir families so I do not have any sympathy for any Member of theSenate who feels this is too hard for them Also I do not appreciatethe fact that we are shut off from debate tonight to be able to talkabout this issue that is before us I see no reason for that to have tooccurI object to the health care bill The American people object to thehealth care billsixtyone percent say no But we are supposed to nowagree and go along with the majority And if we do not we are somesort of obstructionists I do not think so I believe I am representingmy constituency I believe I am representing the best interests of theUnited States of America I do not believe this health care bill ispart of thatWith regard to the armed services billI am a member of the ArmedServices Committee and I have been a Member for 12 years I have beento Iraq six times and Afghanistan six timesI believe it is great wecan give our soldiers a pay raise and support them A lot of things inthe bill are good There are some that are cut too much but there area lot of things that are good and I wish to vote for the bill Butthis defense bill has 18 billion in unrelated spending items attachedit increased unemployment COBRA food stamps and loan subsidies forbusinessesTwo things strike me about this First these new expenditures arenot paid for They are not within the budget They are above thebudget What does that mean Well the budget itself has us in deficitSo if it is not paid for in the budget resolution every penny of this18 billion goes straight to the debt of the United States of AmericaWe need to stop thisSecond why did they put this kind of spending on the defense billBecause they want to come down here and say Anybody who is not willingto go along with this scheme to pad 18 billion straight to the debt ofthe United States of Americaanybody who objects does not love oursoldiersThat is wrong and people are getting tired of that This is how thedebt of this country is surging out of controlThis Congress is irresponsible in our spending We have increased thedebt the likes of which this Nation has never seen and we are spendingas if it is going out of styleI would point out one matter here about the interest we pay on thedebt In 2008 the annual deficit was 450 billionat that time thelargest ever This past year the deficit for the fiscal year endingSeptember 30 was 1400 billion 14 trillion This puts us on themap according to the Congressional Budget Office to double the entiredebt of America in 5 years and triple it in 10 UnbelievableThis is a kind of gimmickattaching unpaid for nonbudgeted items tothe defense bill then trying to force it through so we cannot doanything about it They snicker I am sure in their selfconfident waythat We got em If they object to the bill we will say they dontlove our soldiers they dont support Americas defenseI am getting tired of it I think the American people are gettingtired of it I saw a poll where the most popular party in America todayis the tea partymore than Republicans or DemocratsSomebody said Well 18 billion Sessions that is not too muchmoney But it is done on bill after bill This is not the only billthat has these kinds of gimmicks in it Let me show you I figured thisout one day I put together a chart here a little bit hastily BaselineIncreases A Destructive PatternWhen we increase funding in these bills above the budgeted amount andincrease the debt people like to think Well it is just 18 billionThat is not muchLook how that works when you do it over a period of ten years Solets say next year we go over 18 billion This adds another 18billion to the national debt Well that is not so much But wait itis a lot The State of Alabamas general fund budget is 2 billion Donot tell me 18 billion in one bill on top of this defense bill isnot a lot of money It is a huge amount of moneyBut it does not work that way This 18 billion tends to go into thebaseline so the next year when they talk about increasing the budgetthey pad it by another 18 billion It is not just 18 billion the nextyear you see It is 18 billion on top of what was pumped into thebaseline the year before and that totals out to 36 billion Then thenext year it is 36 billion plus 18 billion more And the next yearit is 54 billion plus 18 billion more The next year it is 72billion plus 18 billion The next year it is 90 billion plus 18billion And the next years it is 108 billion 126 billion 144billion and 162 billion if you pad the budget And this bill is just1 of 13 accounts Defense We have 13 different spending bills Howmuch is that It is 900 billion in additional deficits just becauseof our inability our unwillingness to stay by the numbers that wevoted on as our budget limitThe budget itself as presented by the President and passed by theDemocratic majority put us on a road to having 14 trillion indeficit last year and it looks as though this year we are going tohave a another 14 trillion deficit But just this one little gimmickif it is replicated each year can add almost 1 trillion more to thedebt of America over ten years That is why we are concerned about itBy the way when we talk about the scheme that puts us on the roadaccording to the Congressional Budget Office to tripling the debt ofAmerica by 2019 that does not include the health care bill The healthcare bill has not passed This outlook only includes the things thatare in law now So how much more would those figures be if the debtgoes upI will point to one last thing about the overall financial status ofthis country the interest we pay on that debt This chart shows itLast year this Nation paid 170 billion in interest on theborrowings we have as a nation In that 1 year it was 170 billionThat is a lot of money As I said not counting the State educationbudget for all the other matters of our State of 46 million peoplewhich is almost onefiftieth of the Nations population an averagesized Stateour general fund is 2 billion However 170 billion ishow much we paid in interest last year According to the CongressionalBudget Office those numbers will increase to where in 2019 as aresult of surging debt 799 billion will be added to our debt becauseof interest we must pay 799 billion just in that 1 year That is morethan the whole defense budget That is more than the whole USdiscretionary budget from not too long ago That is a huge amount ofmoney It is going to crowd out spending for schools for highways forhealth care and for other projectsI am very upset about it We cannot continue The President has saidthis is an unsustainable course Every economist we talk to says it isan unsustainable courseBut how do we get there We get there by taking a Defense bill andtacking on 18 billion worth of unfunded spending Every penny of thatgets added to the debtI urge my colleagues to send this bill back and reform it so we canhave a clean Defense bill We need to take these unpaid matters out andmake sure they are paid forI thank the Chair and yield the floor
S_NH_GREGG,2009-12-03,Regrettably I am not immediately familiar with it I have probablyseen it although I apologize for not being immediately familiar withit Therefore I presume the assistant leader is going to remind me orat least reacquaint me with its terms I would note the term PonziAct did not come from me It came from the chairman of the BudgetCommittee  Will the Senator yield for a question  The Senator is absolutely right to point out the Bennetamendment is a shell game charade and a farce that there will stillbe12 trillion in the first 10 years but actually 25 trillion overthe period 2010 to 2029 to be cut out of MedicareEarlier the majority leader came to the floor and talked about a memothat I sent around which is a fairly innocuous memo to our fellowMembers which outlined the rights to fellow Members relative to flooractivity and I sent in my position as Budget ranking member becausemost of these issues are tied to the budget and the covering lettersaid we as a minority must use the tools we have under the Senate rulesto insist on a full complete and fully informed debate on health carelegislation as well as all legislation that comes before the SenateI ask the Republican leader is it not reasonable that we should havea full complete and fair debate on this health care bill  If the Republican leader will yield further it is ironicis it not that the majority leader would come to the floor andcomplain about an innocuous statement that outlines the rules whichMembers of the Senate have a statement which I suspect he actuallywould pass out to his members for information were they in theminoritymaybe even in the majority because they would like to knowhow the rules work in the Senateafter the majority leader hadcompletely subverted the rules of the Senate by not taking this 2074page bill through committee so it could be amended in the open so itcould be amended but rather writing it in the back room some closetaround here with three or four Members of the Senate present Isntthere an ironic inconsistency to his outrage on the fact that wesuggested people should know the rules here while he has basicallytried to go around the rules  I will ask one more question because I find the irony inthe situation so unique A memo which outlines what the rights are ofall Membersbut Members of the minority specifically because the rulesare meant to protect the minority from the majority that is thetradition of our Government of course which seems to be an affront tothe majority at this pointthat a memo of that nature whichessentially says the minority has certain rights in order for theinstitution to function correctlyI am wondering why did we createthese rules in the first place Wasnt it so we could continue thethought of Adams of Madison who suggested that the Senate should bethe place where when legislation comes forward which has been rushedthrough the House the Senate should be the place where thatlegislation receives a deliberative view where it is explored as toits unintended consequences and as to its consequences generally andwhere the body has the opportunity to amend it effectively so it can beimproved Isnt that the purpose of the Senate And isnt that what therules of the Senate are designed to do to accomplish the goals of ourFounding Fathers to have a Senate where the legislation is adequatelyaired and considered versus being rushed through in a precipitous way  I suspectwere the majority leader in the minority he would be insisting onexactly what the Republican leader is insisting ona fair and opendebate which allows the minority to make its case as to the good pointsin this bill and as to the bad points The way you make that case is byfollowing the rules of the Senate is that not correct  If the Senator would allow me to comment on that onepoint  I appreciate the proposal of the Senator from RhodeIsland but I think it needs to be put in its proper context This is asense of the Senate It has no legal implications The CLASS Act asproposed in the underlying bill was described by the Senator fromRhode Island but not fully The way the CLASS Act works it is aninsurance program theoretically where people in their thirties andforties and fifties can buy insurance to cover their retirement yearswhen they have to go into some sort of longterm care facility and maybe institutionalized People are paying into this program for decadesmaybe four decades maybe their thirties right into their seventies ortheir twenties into their sixties The cost of this program does notactually start to be incurred until these folks move into a longtermcare facility or a managed care facility type of situation for theirretirement years where they need skilled nursing assistance of somesortThere is a huge amount of premium that comes in under this programearly which goes against virtually no expenses because this is abrandnew program It is a startup program It is created by the FederalGovernment It is a government insurance program much like SocialSecurity and Medicare The practical effect of that is that money willcome in for years to the Federal coffers In the first 10 years of thisbill it is estimated around 90 billion will come in In the secondas we move out in the second 10 years the total over those two periodsof 10 years is about 212 billion Then more money will come in in thethird 10 years probably somewhere in the vicinity of 300 billion to400 billion potentially None of this will be spent on the purposes ofthis insurance because almost everybody who is paying in for thesepremiums is going to be too young to go into one of theseinstitutionalized care facilities during those first three decadesSo what happens is that the Federal Government gets this largewindfall of money from these people who are paying their premiums andspends it spends it on something elseeducation roads highwaysarts whatever is the decision on where to spend the money It getsspent That is the way the Federal Government works It doesnt haveany place to put this money and keep it safe It comes in and it getsspent When these people retire when they do go into a situation wherethey need assisted living of some sort then the government gets thebill Not us not those of us who are here We will be long retired bythen everybody in this Chamber except maybe Senator Bennet fromColorado who is rather young and vibrant The rest of us will probablynot be around to take advantage of this It will be our children andgrandchildren who will end up with that billThat bill will be staggering We are talking hundreds of billions ifnot trillions of dollars of outyear costs as a result of this type ofprogram much like Social Security which basically has nothing in thecoffers today even though trillions of dollars have been paid in butwhich has a lot of obligations The same thing with Medicare That wasan insurance program which was supposed to have money in the coffersNot there In fact it goes into negative cashflow and will beinsolvent beginning in 2010 There is no money when these folks retireand need it It will have been spentThis amendment well intentioned as a statement has absolutely noeffect on that series of events That money will still be spent underthis amendment After this amendment is passedand I presume it willbe passed it is a nonevent amendment having no purpose other than apolitical statementCBO will still score this bill as spending thatmoney absolutely score this bill as spending that money the 90billion for the next 10 years the 212 billion for the next 20 yearsthe 400 billion after that That is my guess The third 10yearperiod my guess is 500 billion When we get out there 30 40 yearsfrom now and these people expect to get their insurance paid then whenour children get the bill for that insurance it becomes a tax on thema direct tax on their earnings It will affect their lifestyle theirearning capacity their ability to buy a home to send a child tocollege to buy a car This money will be spent under this billOne of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who is prettyrespected around here on financial matters I believe referred to thisCLASS Act proposal as a Ponzi scheme That is not too far offBasically we are taking the money from these folks who buy into thisinsurance program today We are spending it on something we want tospend it on as a Congress today whether it is something worthwhilesuch as a road or education or our national defense but we arespending it We are leaving the people who paid that premium out tolunch unless 30 or 40 years from now when they go into that situationwhere they need that insurance the country is strong enough and ourkids are making enough money to pay for the cost of that program Thatis a real gamble for them and that is called a Ponzi scheme which isexactly what this is This bill this sense of the Senate although agood political document because it allows Members to wander aroundtheir districts and say I voted to protect the CLASS Act dollars Ivoted that it not be accounted for under this bill that was a sense ofthe Senate In actuality it has no effect at all in that areaAll the money that comes into this insurance money is going to bespent somewhere else And the CBO will still score this bill as takingcredit for that insurance under this program It is Bernie Madoffaccounting one more time under this bill You would think after a whilepeople would get embarrassedreally it would become embarrassingafter a while When you match up 10 years of tax increases 10 years ofMedicare cuts to 5 years of programmatic spending and claim you have aprogram that is fully paid for and is only an 840 billion programwhen you know that if the program the entire bill is fully phased init is 25 trillion in cost It isnt 500 billion in Medicare cutswhen this thing is fully phased in it is 1 trillion in Medicare cutsIt isnt 500 billion of tax increases in this bill and fee increaseson small businesses mostly or on provider groups it is over 1trillion of increases You would think after a while people would beembarrassed about the manipulation of numbers in that way But thatdoesnt seem to occur Yet we get this proposal that says OK lets doit again Lets claim we are doing something we are not doing Letsclaim we are protecting the dollars that come in under this new CLASSAct proposal assuming this program goes into place Lets claim we aresegregating them somehow so the people who pay their hardearneddollars and buy into this CLASS Act think they are getting somethingfor it when in fact that will not happen at all is not going tohappen at all That money is going to be spent the day it comes in Infact it is already spent We are already borrowing so much andspending so much in this government right now We already have anobligation of debt that will spend this moneyI guess everybody can walk away feeling good about this amendmentbut substantively it has no impact at all   The Senator has asked a very pointed and appropriatequestion because the answer is pretty startling The point I thinkmost people dont understand is that this money gets spent as it comesin In other words lets say over the next 30 years younger peoplepay into this new alleged insurance program accurately described as aPonzi scheme All that money that comes in will be spent on otheractivities of the government and therefore the other activities ofgovernment will be allowed to grow fairly dramatically There will be alot of money here You are talking potentially 1 trillion over thenext 30 yearsThose expenditures which will have occurred as a result of thismoney coming in which will have nothing at all to do with paying forthe cost of the health care which these people who buy into this CLASSAct think they are gettingin other words longterm care insuranceit has nothing to do with thatit will be on as I said educationroads national defense whatever we spend it on around here Thoseexpenditures will be built into the baseline forever They will presumethat there is going to be revenue to pay for them What happens whenthat generation that has bought into the CLASS Act starts to actuallyneed the money it is alleged it is going to get Two things happen Theyounger generation is going to have to pay taxes to cover that costbecause the money will not be there There will be no money in thekitty none zero There will be zero money in the kitty the allegedkitty to pay for this insurance program Second ironically thegovernment will have been grown by all the money that came in and wasspent on new programs So you are basically going to double down on thecost hereOur children and our grandchildren are going to have to pay twicenot only to pay for the longterm care which allegedly has beenpromised to these people under these insurance programs but also to payfor all the new spending that will occur as a result of spending thepremiums which were supposed to be saved for these programs So theyare going to get hit twice The implications are quite honestlystaggeringWe already know we have a 38 trillion unfunded liability inMedicare We know when you combine Medicare Medicaid and SocialSecurity we have a 60 trillion unfunded liability If you calculatein the cost of the CLASS Act on top of that you are adding potentiallytrillions more of unfunded liability which will all have to be paid byour children and our grandchildrenAt the essence of this bill there are a number of problems but theproblem I find most inappropriate in the way we are doing this is weare creating a government which our kids cannot afford under anycircumstance We are absolutely guaranteeing that our children aregoing to have a lower standard of living than we had because of theburden we are going to put on them as a result of these expansive newprograms which we know cannot be afforded in the outyearsWe already know we cannot afford the government we have in theoutyears We already know the public debt is headed above 80 percent ofGDP by 2019 So the Senator from South Dakota has touched on a coreissue What is the real cost of this Well it is extraordinary As Isaid it hits the next generation twice First they will have to paythe taxes to pay for the program that was put on the books which isallegedly there plus they will have to pay to support all the programswhich the money that came in was supposed to be preserved for  I think the Senator from South Dakota touched on anotherpoint The sense of the Senate basically confirms the fundamentalflaw of the CLASS Act The fact that you would think a sense of theSenate is necessary pretty much proves that everybody around hereunderstands there is a big game going on with the CLASS Act Theproblem is of course the sense of the Senate has no effect of lawand therefore the problems the CLASS Act creates in the area ofspending the revenues that come in for the purpose of something otherthan what the CLASS Act alleges people are buying when they pay forthat insurance will still exist and the CBO will still score theCLASS Act as benefiting the budget situation when it should not bescored that way at allAs I said this is a nice resolution from a political standpoint butsubstantively it has no effect on correcting the problems which theCLASS Act generate in the area of fiscal policyI understand there is a unanimous consent request that somebodywishes to offer I was asked if I would listen to it  I ask the assistant leader is he offering a unanimousconsent request I will yield the floor for the purposes of a unanimousconsent request  Reserving the right to object my only concern would bethat will take us past 7 oclock so you may want to adjust the time  Is it my understanding then the order of recognitionwill be Senator Whitehouse the assistant leader and then SenatorHatch  I was just wondering if the Senator would yield for aquestion  Is the Ponzi family from Chicago  The first 30 years ofthe CLASS Act will generate revenues It will add to the FederalTreasury and willand that was the purpose of my discussion that isthe point I madeduring the first 30 years of this proposal youngerpeople will be paying in and very few people will be taking out becausethey will not have yet qualified for the insurance because they willnot be old enough to go into assisted living
S_CO_UDALL,2009-12-20, President I thank the Senator fromMontana for yielding I thank him for his tremendous leadership on thisimportant fight here on the floor of the SenateFirst I commend my colleagues for strapping on their snow gear ThePresiding Officer comes from the State of Minnesota where this kind ofa storm we have had over the last few days is not that unusual adevelopment I like a good 16inch dusting from time to time We allknow what an important issue reforming our health care system is andbraving the elements is a small price to payI have come to the floor a lot over the past few months to discussthe challenges that are facing us as we work toward fixing our brokenhealth care system One overarching theme I continue to emphasize isjust how important this is to putting our economy back on trackWe have a bloated 12 trillion Federal debt which is being fed dailyby growing health care costs Every day employers small and largeare laying off workers and slashing benefits for their employees GreatAmerican businesses especially in our manufacturing sector havenearly collapsed because of the rising costs of providing health carefor their workersThose Americans who have coverage lack the peace of mind in knowingthat their insurance will be there just when they need it This lack ofstability and peace of mind is a fundamental problem with the statusquo today because it takes away one of the things valued most byAmericans their freedom Today they are reluctant to move to a newjob to advance their education or start a small business for fearthey wont be able to provide health care for their familiesAs we struggle to mend our economy we cant afford to tell people tostay put We know from history that encouraging the entrepreneurialspirit of Americans is the key to promoting small business creatingjobs and driving our economic recovery Small businesses haveaccounted for 65 percent of all new jobs created in the past 15 yearsbut today anyone who owns or has ever tried to start their own businesscan attest to why rising health care costs is such a major problem inthis countryTake for example the story of a gentleman who just recentlycontacted me from Denver I will pick up on the theme the Senator fromOhio was touching upon If we listened to the people in our Statesthere would be no question that this reform is necessary Dave is asmall business owner Last year he saw his insurance premiumsskyrocket 27 percent for his employees When he questioned thisunbelievable increase his insurance company said all he needed to doto save money was just stop offering coverage to his employees Justlet them buy their own insurance his insurance company told him Whenhe looked into that when he checked it out he found out that nearlyhalf of his workforce would be ineligible for coverage because ofpreexisting conditions and that those who could obtain coverage werepriced out and couldnt even afford itI hear this story time and time againsmall business owners who wantto do the right thing but end up facing annual doubledigit increasesin their costs This is so troubling in this economic time becausesmall businesses pay on average 18 percent more than large employersfor the same level of coverageThe status quoand the Presiding Officer has been articulate andeloquent and involved in this fightas he knows is unacceptable andwe cant kick the can down the road any longer The good news is thelegislation we are considering contains essential provisions aimed athelping small businesses individuals and American families across ourcountry Let me touch on a few of the important provisions that are inthis final packageHealth insurers will be organized into wellregulated marketplacesand finally forced to compete This would then involve a creation of amore transparent process for individuals and small businesses so forthe first time you can actually compare insurance plans side by sideThe legislation helps individuals pay for these newfound healthinsurance options More than half of the cost of reform goes tofinancing tax credits to put money back in the pockets of middleclassfamilies to help them purchase a health plan As Chairman Baucus haspointed out these tax credits represent the biggest tax cut since2001In addition starting in 2010 many small businesses will alsoqualify for new tax credits worth up to 50 percent of the cost ofproviding health insurance to their employeesAlso in this billI cant emphasize this enoughAmericans will nolonger go bankrupt because of health care costs We are the onlydeveloped country in the world where citizens go bankrupt because theyhave health care costs they cant affordInsurers will be prohibited from denying access to health carebecause of preexisting conditions limiting coverage because of age orgender or dropping the insurance someone has already paid for simplybecause they get sickRegardless of what we hear from our friends on the other side of theaisle this legislation saves money it strengthens Medicare itreduces the deficit and it puts us on a path to finally addressing ourgrowing national debt In fact noted MIT economist Jon Gruberestimates this bill will save small businesses 25 percent or about 65billion per year on health insurance That translates into 30 billionin takehome pay and an estimated 80000 saved jobsWhile the bill before us makes important improvements I would alsolike to say a few words about the package of amendments offered by thedistinguished majority leader I took some time as I think we all didover the last snowy 24 hours to familiarize myself with the changesand I wish to touch on some of the most promising revisions that havebeen madeI wish to first note my appreciation for including the freshmanpackage These amendments were offered by myself and the freshmanclass of which the Presiding Officer is a member andthey have attracted bipartisan support They boast the endorsements ofbusiness labor and consumer groups The provisions inject more costcontainment in the bill cut down on regulatory and bureaucraticredtape and push even more aggressively toward a reformed health caresystemI am particularly pleased to see a provision I worked on that wouldexpand the scope of a new board designed to strengthen Medicare Theamendment would task this board not only to monitor Medicare but tolook for ways to improve the entire health care system as a whole Ibelieve the independent payment advisory board is one of the best costcontainment tools in the bill and I want to acknowledge SenatorRockefeller for his work in developing the idea as well as Leader Reidfor putting even more bite into the authority of this important panelof expertsSecond I wish to express how proud I am that Majority Leader Reidput so much emphasis in the managers amendment on improving healthcare in rural America The difficulty of accessing health care in ruralcommunities is a unique struggle I have been increasingly concernedabout especially as I have traveled around Colorados rural areas inthe past several months I am glad to see the inclusion of an amendmentI authored to establish a rural physician pipeline training programdesigned to help bolster our rural health care workforce Many of mycolleagues joined me in offering this important amendment which has thepotential to recruit and train more doctors to practice in rural areasIn addition I also authored an amendment that would establish anexplicitly rural element to the community transformation grant programwhich is aimed at helping prevent and reduce chronic disease incommunities across the countryMy amendment would ensure that rural areas are getting their share ofthis critical prevention and wellness funding and I was very proud tosee this important change included as wellAs I begin to close I wish to say that although this bill has beenstrengthened significantly by the majority leaders efforts it is notperfect But I do not think anyone expects Congress to craft a perfectpiece of legislation We could never send the President a bill thatfixes all the problems in our health care system or exactly reflectsthe priorities of every single Member of Congress including myselfBut what I am confident of is this legislation can establish a sturdyfoundation upon which we will build improve and strengthen access tohealth care in AmericaWill there be mistakes made along the way I do not doubt it But asa lifelong mountain climber I know from experience that the stumblesyou experience along the way are a necessary part of reaching anymountaintop Providing insurance and quality care for all our citizensis a onceinalifetime opportunity to improve the health and wellbeing of every American These are the goals of our health insurancereform and over the next few days I look forward to passing a billwhich modernizes our health care delivery system increases much neededchoice and competition in the health insurance industry and helps putour economy back on track while improving the financial security ofmiddleclass working familiesI yield the floor
S_MI_LEVIN,2009-12-20, President first let me thank the Senator fromMontana for the extraordinary work he has put in on this bill for solong so many months so many years Thanks also go of course to theDemocratic leader our majority leader Senator Dodd and others whohave worked so hard to get us hereWe are in a pivotal moment in the long fight to reform our healthcare system Everyone should by now be well aware of the historyhowPresidents of both parties have tried and failed to achieve reform andhow after months of painstaking review we have arrived at thisinstant closer than ever to health care reformIt would be impossible to fashion legislation on an issue so massiveand so complex on which all could agree in every detail Those seekingperfection will have to look outside this Chamber or for that matterin any piece of complex legislationBut when they look outside the walls of this Capitol Senators willalso find problems that dwarf the imperfections in this bill They willfind a broken health care system one in which we pay vastly more thanother wealthy nations for care that is in many cases demonstrablyinferior They will find Americans struggling to afford the health carecoverage they have and employers struggling to provide insurance totheir employees They will find manufacturers struggling under a costlyhealth care burden from which their international competitors werelong ago freed They will find employee and employer alike plagued byneverending uncertainty about the cost and availability of healthinsurance an instability that haunts families and hinders jobcreation They will find costs rising so fast they threaten to swallowthe rest of the Federal budget and sink family budgets They will findastonishing amounts of money spent not on better care or innovativetreatments but on overhead and bureaucracy They will find millions ofAmericans with no coverage at alla tragedy for the uninsured and asource of inefficiency and expense that make health care more expensivefor all of usSo the choice before us now is whether any imperfections we might seein this bill outweigh the mountain of evidence that our current systemis in dire need of repair It is between moving forward on asignificant repair of a broken system or quashing yet another attemptto reform health care in surrender to the status quo and to therhetoric of distortion and fearTo me this choice is clear We cannot wait any longer for healthcare reform The people of my State cannot wait The people of thisNation cannot wait Now is the time for all those years of frustratedeffort all the research and analysis all the debate and discussionfor us to reform a broken system We must vote for cloture on themanagers amendment before us and continue to vote for cloture on theendless filibusters that confront us because we cannot waitWe cannot wait any longer to reform this system because its costs areout of control In 1990 this Nation 123 percent of its grossdomestic product on health care That is 1 in 8 By 2018 the Centersfor Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS estimates that figure willincrease to 20 percent and 1 in every 5 will go to health care CMSestimates that after spending about 6000 per capita on health care in2003 we will spend more than 13000 per capita in 2018 more thandoubling our perperson expenditures in 15 yearsThis translates directly into unsustainable costs for the Americanpeople According to the Kaiser Family Foundation thousands fewer ofour businesses are offering insurance than a decade ago a clear signthey can no longer sustain cost increases of 6 percent or more yearafter year If we do nothing these costs will continue to rise at arate which will swallow the budgets of families businesses andgovernmentWe cannot wait any longer because even for those fortunate enough tohave insurance where they work they are increasingly unsure it will bethere when they need it most Every Member of this body has heard fromconstituents who thought they had solid health insurance only to findout their insurer had wriggled out of paying for desperately neededcare or found a convenient preexisting condition that voided theircoverage or capped their coverage so they faced a crushing choicebetween treatments they had to have and costs they could not affordEven in cases where families have health insurance medical emergenciescan leave debilitating costs in their wake According to a study in theAmerican Journal of Medicine 62 percent of all bankruptcies filed inthe United States in 2007 involved medical costs and even morecompelling threequarters of those bankruptcies involved people whohad health insurance when they got sick There can be no more clearsign of the need to act than the fact that having health insurance isno insurance against bankruptcy from medical costsWe cannot wait any longer because so much of the enormous cost at theheart of this health care crisis is money spent on that having littleor nothing to do with quality care For example for those who purchaseinsurance in the individual market roughly 30 percent of the coststhey pay will stem from the insurance companys administrativeexpenseson bureaucracy not medicine A 2003 study published in theNew England Journal of Medicine found that in 1999 Americans spentover 1000 per capita on health care administration costsmore than1000 for every man woman and child in this Nation spent onpaperwork and redtape Electronic medical records which makeadministration more efficient and improve the quality of care arestill not in use for most patientsFinally we cannot wait any longer because the inefficiencies of oursystem are crushing us and our budgets and even more pointedlybecause so many lives are at stake One hundred forty thousandAmericans have lost their lives since 2000 because they lacked healthinsurance We cannot afford to walk down this road any longer We mustchange direction This bill will do it in a positive wayAn analysis by the Urban Institute using methodology developed bythe Institute of Medicine determined that since 2000 nearly 140000Americans have lost their lives because they lacked health insuranceOther studies show that breast cancer patients stroke victims andother patients are as common sense suggests far more likely to diefrom their conditions if they lack adequate health insurance These arerigorous studies that bring us to an inescapable conclusion If we failto act Americans will continue to lose their lives when they need notsimply because they dont have adequate health insurance or any healthinsurance at allFor these reasons and many others it is long past time to reform oursystem The question we must then answer is will we come closer to ahealth care system worthy of this Nation if we pass this billI believe we will The legislation before us will reform theinsurance system in powerful ways protecting patients from the host ofabuses they now so often face We will begin to control spiraling costsin many ways and establish research centers to find new ways toimprove care and lower costs We will create powerful incentives toreduce administrative burdens and costs And we will bring millions ofAmericans into the health care system reducing the number ofuninsured and reducing what is both a burden of inefficiency on thesystem and a moral blemish on our NationWe are out of time and out of excuses Now we must choose Choosebetween beginning to reform on the one hand and continuing the statusquo on the other Our individual problems with this bill cannot beallowed to overshadow the much larger problems with our health caresystem Near the end of this long path toward health care reform wecannot turn back The Senate needs to move forwardAgain I thank my good friend from Montana and the other leaders whohave made it possible for us to get to this pointThe PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Udall of Colorado The Senator fromMontana is recognized
