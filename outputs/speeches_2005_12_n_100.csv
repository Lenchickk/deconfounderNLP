performance metrics Speaker I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials on the bill under consideration Speaker I rise in support of this bill and yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker Congress instructed FEMA in the PostKatrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 and in the Implementing Recommendations of the 911 Commission Act of 2007 to develop performance metrics for its homeland security grants programs As the House Committee on Homeland Security discovered in our October 27 subcommittee hearing I held with my ranking member hearing on emergency communications these requirements remain poorly implemented and difficult to comprehend What is most disconcerting is that FEMA still cannot determine our Nations overall preparedness or how homeland security grants have helped to protect our Nation from acts of terrorism It is for these reasons that I come to you today to ask for your support of HR 3980 the Redundancy Elimination and Enhancement Performance for Preparedness Grants Act This legislation would require FEMA to work in conjunction with State local tribal and territorial stakeholders to develop a plan to do the following things Streamline homeland security grant reporting requirements rules and regulations to eliminate redundant reporting Create a strategy including a timetable for establishing the much needed performance metrics for grant programs to ensure that the funds are being directed to the areas where they will be best spent Require FEMA to take an inventory of each of the homeland security grant programs to include the purpose objectives and performance goals for each The plan will be submitted to the appropriate congressional committees no later than 120 days after the bills enactment It will be updated biannually to ensure that the committee is able to maintain a watchful eye and the oversight on redundancies in the law that might confuse the grant recipients at the local level This bill will help identify inefficiencies with the DHS grants programs and this bill will increase the quality of service received by DHS grant recipients I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Washington DC December 1 2009 Hon Bennie G Thompson Chairman Committee on Homeland Security Washington DC Dear Chairman Thompson I write to you regarding HR 3980 the Redundancy Elimination and Enhanced Performance for Preparedness Grants Act

the balance of my time Mr Speaker The yeas and nays were ordered Mr Speaker as you heard this is commonsense legislation that will streamline FEMAs efforts to enhance our Nations preparedness and response capacity All were trying to do is to make sure that we get rid of any unnecessary rules and regulations that cause our local folks problems Number two were also trying to make sure that we measure the results If were going to spend billions of dollars on grants weve just got to make sure that we measure those particular results The bottom line is Mr Speaker were trying to focus on the customers and the customers are the recipients of these grants I certainly want to thank our ranking member Mr Rogers Hes done an outstanding job there in the committee I look forward to working with him not only on this legislation to make it law but certainly on other pieces of legislation I urge all my colleagues to vote aye 
S_VT_LEAHY,2009-12-11,1975_2009; 1975_2009; 1975_2009,0377; 0378; 0379, President I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded President Division F of this omnibus conference agreement provides funding for the State Department Foreign Operations and related programs I want to thank the ranking member of the subcommittee Senator Gregg and his very capable staff Paul Grove and Michele Wymer for once again working with me and my staff in a bipartisan manner to produce this conference agreement I also want to thank Chairwoman Nita Lowey and Ranking Member Kay Granger and their staffs for working so cooperatively with us throughout this process The fiscal year 2010 State Foreign Operations conference agreement provides 488 billion in discretionary funding a 33 billion decrease from the Presidents budget request of 52 billion The bill is 12 billion below the fiscal year 2009 level including supplemental funds This is an important point that needs to be understood by all Senators because yesterday a Senator on the other side of the aisle criticized this bill for being 31 percent above fiscal year 2009 That is misleading because it does not account for the billions of dollars in fiscal year 2009 emergency supplemental funding that was the standard way of doing business under the previous administration To ignore those costs to American taxpayers is disingenuous President Obama has made clear that he intends to fund these programs on budget not through supplemental gimmicks That is what the Congress urged him to do and now he is being criticized for doing so If you compare apples to apples this bill provides 12 billion less spending than in fiscal year 2009 Some Republican Senators have made speeches against this omnibus package on account of earmarks they dont like even though some of them requested their own earmarks In fact earmarks comprise a tiny fraction of the total package Like past years the StateForeign Operations conference agreement does not contain any earmarks as defined by the Appropriations Committee We do fund many programs that are priorities of Democrats and Republicans including assistance for countries like Afghanistan Pakistan and Iraq and longstanding allies like Israel Egypt and Jordan In addition the conference agreement provides 57 billion to combat HIVAIDS including 750 million for the Global Fund Funds are provided to combat other diseases like malaria tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases The agreement provides 12 billion for climate change and environment programs including for clean energy programs and to protect forests The agreement provides 12 billion for agriculture and food security programs with authority to provide additional funds There are provisions dealing with corruption and human rights funding for international organizations like the United Nations NATO and the International Atomic Energy Agency and to promote democracy economic development and the rule of law from Central America to Central Asia The conference agreement provides the funds to support our embassies and diplomats around the world public diplomacy and broadcasting programs the Peace Corps and many other programs that promote United States interests I dont support everything in this omnibus package any more than anyone else does I had hoped as I know did Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman Cochran that we could have brought each of the bills in this omnibus including the StateForeign Operations bill to the Senate floor individually But a handful of Senators on the other side have made clear that they will do whatever is procedurally possible to slow down or prevent consideration of these bills Despite that I can say that the State Foreign Operations conference agreement was negotiated with the full participation of both House and Senate chairmen and ranking members It was in every sense a collaborative process It is a balanced agreement and should be supported by every Senator who cares about US security and the security of our allies and friends around the world President I want to briefly discuss a subject that should interest all Senators concerning the country of El Salvador which recently elected a new President and last month suffered extensive loss of life and devastating property damage as a result of torrential rains caused by Hurricane Ida First I congratulate the people of El Salvador on the election which was historic in that President Funes is the countrys first President since the end of the civil war who is a member of the FMLN which after the 1992 Peace Accords evolved from an armed insurgency into a political party I am encouraged by what I have heard about President Funes policies and wish him the best Second the destruction caused by Hurricane Ida was extensive Exceptionally heavy and constant rain fell on November 7 and 8 resulting in flooding and landslides that killed 192 people Another 80 were reported missing and more than 14295 others were displaced from their homes Thousands of homes as well as roads bridges and other public buildings were damaged or destroyed On November 10 US Charge dAffaires Robert Blau declared a disaster in response to the damage and the US Agency for International Development has so far allocated some 280851 in humanitarian aid An assessment of the total damage is underway but it is expected to be in the hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars Congressman Jim MCGovern and I have urged the administration to provide additional aid We remember how the US Government all but forgot about El Salvador after the war ended and this is a time to help the Salvadoran people recover from this tragedy Third an issue that has deeply concerned me for many years is the problem of corruption and impunity in El Salvador The police and the courts lack the training and resources they need crimes are rarely solved and perpetrators are rarely punished Violent crime and corruption have become endemic El Salvadors democratic and economic development will continue to be impeded by a justice system that is incapable of enforcing the rule of law and in which the Salvadoran people and foreign investors have little confidence One of the courageous Salvadorans who is trying to change this is Ms Zaira Navas inspector general of the National Police She has a woefully inadequate budget and too few staff But despite that from everything I have heard she is doing an outstanding job for justice and the people of El Salvador I mention Ms Navas because of the critical importance of the job she is doing and because she has recently received death threats and I am concerned for her safety I urge officials at the US Embassy to discuss with President Funes what steps can be taken immediately to provide her the security she needs and to increase the budget of her office El Salvador is a small country but one with which the US has a long history We both have newly elected presidents and I am hopeful that we will see a renewed effort to work together to broaden our relations Nothing in my view is more important than strengthening the rule of law and supporting people like Ms Navas but we should also expand our collaboration in health education and exchanges the environment trade and investment science and technology the arts and culture

to the Senator from Tennessee It is a lot of fun isnt it Based on the principle that a fight not joined is a fight not enjoyed I will yield for one more but we have other Senators who wish to speak I would like to finish my answer to you if I may that is I dont know the deal that was cut with them but we will find out I know Bertha Milliard was not there when the deal was cut that generated that letter That is my answer President I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Utah the Senator from Kentucky the Senator from New Hampshire the Senator from Georgia the Senator from Florida and the Senator from Wyoming be allowed to participate in a colloquy President very quickly I wish to remind my colleagues that the AARP continues to be referred to as endorsing this legislation and supporting it and opposing amendments that would have done things that they in the past have supported So I urge my colleagues to look at this Washington articleone of my favorite sources of information and opinion the Washington Post But not advertised in this lobbying campaign have been AARPs substantial earnings from insurance royalties and the potential benefits that would come its way from many other reforms So we have been looking into that and guess what The AARP endorsement of more than 400 billion in Medicare savingsaccording to its own financial statements from 2008 AARP generated 38 percent of its 11 billion in revenue or more than 414 million in royalty fees They also obviously willif we take away Medicare Advantage then Medigap sales will have to go up because that provides for the services that are being taken away So under the AARP they would generate in their endorsementsthey have generated 414 million putting them in fifth place of all of the health insurance companies in America behind United Health Wellpoint Aetna and Humana So we have before the body an amendment that would modify any health insurers remuneration to the same level as the salary of the President of the United States So I ask unanimous consent at this time that the AARP executives be added in under the effect of this pending amendment from the Senator from Arkansas President I also understand that Walmart sells health insurance policies They are based in Arkansas I ask unanimous consent that Walmart be included in this curb on excessive remuneration that will now place them under the same level It is people who sell health insurance I am sorry the Senator from Montana cannot understand that they are people who sell health insurance as well AARP does Walmart does If we are going to have this kind of demagogic amendment then we should include them especially Walmart that does a lot of business I would say to my colleague they not only opposed it they got all of their members fired up in opposition to it We all heard from them back in 2005 These were reductions in spending This was not 438 billion taken out of Medicare and put in to create a new entitlement program of 25 trillion I think the Senator from New Hampshire recalls that debate My quick answer is I dont know what the deal was but I know the people who are in the home health care business who will see 43 billion in cuts to their business the funding for their business were not there when the lobbyists showed up We have already heard the stories of the meetings you and the majority leader have had with these people saying Get on board or when we shape the final parameters of this bill we are going to hurt you We know they have been threatened There are two doctors in the Senate there are lots of lawyers two doctors Both of them have handson experience I dont know if Dr Barrasso has seen this mornings New York Times another of my favorite sources of news information and opinion On the front page this morning Home Care Patients Worry Over Possible Cuts I understand the purpose of health care reform as proposed by the other side is to reduce health care costs Is there a way to reduce health care costs better than treating people at home than instead of in a hospital I am curious about the Senators experience If it is taken out of your time just exactly as you responded when someone asked if you would yield for a question from them yesterday Is it taken out of your time I ask unanimous consent that the time for the Senators question not be taken out of the time that is allotted to us My response is I dont know what deal has been cut in Senator Reids office as the deal was cut with the pharmaceutical companies and the deal was cut with the AMA and the deal was cut with the hospital association But I know what the effect is I know what the effect is The bill would slice 55 billion The House bill would slice 55 billion over 10 years for projected Medicare spending on home health services while the Senate bill would take 43 billion I know that But I dont know the details of the deal that was cut over where the white smoke comes out I dont know what the deal was I know what the deal was with PhRMA I know what the deal was with PhRMA They told them they would oppose drug reimportation from Canada and they told PhRMA they would not allow competition for Medicare patients So I dont know the deal that was cut that bought them but I know deals have been going on and I know they are unsavory I know people such as the lady who was just referred to Bertha Milliard are not too interested in seeing their home health care cut I dont know what the deal was I dont know what the deal was but we will find out just like the deals that were cut with all of these other organizations I cant walk through the hallway without bumping into one of their lobbyists If the Senator keeps interrupting he is violating the rules of the Senate He needs to learn the rules of the Senate The Senator from Georgia has a comment They will probably be called up to Senator Reids office very soon Let me remind the Senator from Montana sometimes there is good news and sometimes it is bad There was an article earlier this year where the staff of the Senator from Montana called in the high paid lobbyists and told them not to meet with Republicans saying that if they did it would be treated as a hostile act I can provide that article for the Record I hope it is not true but I think it is I yield to the Senator from North Carolina for a question and then the Senator from Tennessee Perhaps my other colleagues can explain it better I also want to return for a second to the question of the Senator from Montana The AMA is a classic example When I go back to Arizona and talk to doctors and providers they say What is going on You made a deal with the lobbyists That is my answer to you You made a deal with the lobbyistsnot the home health care providers not the nurses not the doctors the people who are the users of pharmaceuticals who this year have seen an 8 to 9percent increase in the cost of prescription drugsbecause your deal is going to protect them My answer to you is I dont know what you bought that letter for but it was probably a pretty high price The Senator from I yield to the Senator from Wyoming President how much time remains Novelli who has since stepped downan old friendlast year was 1797751 Mr Tauzin a pharmaceutical research and manufacturers lobbyist only made 15 million last year Scott Serota of BlueCross BlueShield made 16 million Chicken feed I yield to the Senator from Utah I ask the Senator from New Hampshire very quickly is it your understanding that AARP does sell health insurance and WalMart sells health insurance Then would it make sense they would be included in the amendment to modify the limit on excessive remuneration paid by certain health insurance providers to set the limit at the same level as the salary of the President of the United States Wouldnt the CEO of Wal Mart and the head of AARP who only made 18 million last year fall under that umbrella I am very reluctant to take a trip down memory lane again Could I say one of the phrases throughout the campaign was If you like the insurance policy you have you can keep it You tell me how people who now have Medicare Advantage can keep it under this proposal It is impossible Maybe the other side is right Maybe these reductions have to be made in Medicare Advantage Maybe those changes have to be made I dont happen to agree although cost savings should be there But no one can believe that you can keep the same Medicare Advantage policy that 11 million seniors in America have today under this proposal It is impossible The Senator from Florida Mr LeMIEUX If the Senator from Arizona will allow I want to ask one question of my friend the medical doctor about infections in hospitals My understanding is that home health care is actually better for the patient it is better for the efficacy of the treatment because a big problem we have in hospitals is that patients get staph infections and other infections In fact it is one of the leading causes of death in a hospital You dont go in with this infection you get it there Isnt this proposal that is going to take people out of home health care and send them to hospitals going to actually hurt patients Thanks to our crack staff who are a good example of the success of work release programs I remind my friend from Montana a Rollcall article as of June 11 Top aides to Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus called a lastminute preemptive strike on Wednesday with a group of prominent Democratic lobbyists warning them to advise their clients not to attend a meeting with Senate Republicans set for Thursday Russell Sullivan Whom I dont happen to know the top staffer on Finance and Jon Selib Baucus chief of staff met with a bloc of more than 20 contract lobbyists including several former Baucus aides Who have made a nice transition They said Republicans are having this meeting and you need to let all of your clients know if they have someone there that will be viewed as a hostile act said a Democratic lobbyist who attended the meeting Going to the Republican meeting will say Im interested in working with Republicans to stop health care reform the lobbyist added Again PhRMA the New York Times again my favorite Tauzin the 15millionperyear representative of PhRMA said We were assured We need somebody to come in first If you come in first you will have a rocksolid deal Billy Tauzin the former Republican House member from Louisiana said Who is ever going to get into a deal with the White House again if they dont keep their word You are just going to duke it out instead They cut a deal That is again in answer to the Senator from Montana that is probably how they got the letter the same way Tauzin wrote his letter The majority leaderthe minority leader hopefully majority leader soon Wouldnt that mean that AARP executive would naturally fall under the Lincoln amendment The Senator from Utah The Senator from Tennessee Not to mention the chief executives of the pharmaceutical companies Why wouldnt we want to bring them in on it After all they are paying for lobbyists at 17 million every year to cut these deals at the White House that they describe on the front page of the New York Times I would hope the Senator would be glad to modify her amendment to include all these other people who have gotten extremely wealthy PhRMA an 8percent increase in drug prices in the last year Again I refer to the New York Times Anyone else Senator Burr Mr President how much time remains We are going to do it again a lot between now and the time the vote is forced and the American people are on our side Madam President as much as I would like to put the last Presidential campaign behind me we seem to be continuing to dredge it up in a totally false manner time after time I ask unanimous consent that my campaign position paper on a specific plan of action lowering health care costs be printed in the Record Then I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement from FactCheckorg of October 20 2008 that says Obamas False Medicare Claim which were the attacks on me which were not based on fact I quote from FactCheckorg These claims are false and based on a single newspaper report that says no such thing MCCains policy director states unequivocally that no benefit cuts are envisioned MCCain does propose substantial savings I did propose savings and we can make savings Nowhere in my wildest imagination did I ever believe we were going to cut benefits in order to create a 25 trillion new entitlement program when the system is already going broke I will have those put in the Record The Senator from Massachusetts wants to distort my record and that is fine But it gets a little I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Massachusetts be allowed 3 additional minutes and I be allowed 2 additional minutes This has been a vigorous debate I see my prime adversary the Senator from Illinois on the floor whom I look forward to doing battle with additionally as well as my friend from Massachusetts The fundamental point I would say to my friend from Massachusetts is that I never envisioned nor do I believe the American people ever envisioned we would be cutting benefits or as the Senator says making savings in order to transfer that to a brand new entitlement program That is what the debate is about whether we are going to take a failing system that in 7 years is going bankrupt according to the Medicare trustees and then take all this money no matter how these savings are madeand I believe they are cuts of huge magnitudeand then fund a brandnew entitlement program That is what this real debate is about I thank my friend from Massachusetts for his courtesy I look forward to the rebuttal from the Senator from Illinois as well as the Senator from Montana Thank you I yield the floor Several Senators addressed the Chair

0160; 0161; 0162; 0163; 0164, Before my colleague leaves the floor I wish to ask him a question or two if he wouldnt mind He has been involved in most of the major health issues that have passed this body in the last 15 years What was the vote margin in the Senate on some of those bills on the HatchKennedy HatchWaxman bills How many votes roughly I am not asking you to pull that up from memory and it may not be fair to do As I recall a number of people on both sides of the aisle ended up supporting those bills In the Finance Committee I believe you did a major health care bill with Senator Dodd from Connecticut Do you recall the split If I could respond to my colleague I do not know of any I dont know of any who were even asked I know of some who were told you can join this bill or asked thatOK can you join our bill but you dont have any input I havent seen any at all and particularly when we tried to work in a bipartisan fashion to add Hyde language into the bill that was defeated not accepted My point is something I have seen the Senator say in a quote that a good health care bill should have 70 votes because it is major legislation that affects everybody in the United States It has huge costs associated with it So it is not something you do on a single party basis it is something you work extensively on over a long period of time I ask my colleague again over how many years he worked with Senator Kennedy on getting the HatchKennedy bill or Waxmanmy guess is those are lengthy pieces of negotiations that take a period of time to get something that has bipartisan support If I could ask one more question before my colleague leavesand also a comment that I like the Senators tie nice bright colors on a Saturday session What does the Senator think of gettinghow many total votes could you get for a bipartisan health care bill along the lines of which a number of people on our side have discussed where you expand access you try to bend the cost curve down you try to get more access to lowincome individuals Does the Senator think he could craft a bipartisan bill that could get well over 60 votes on health care reform I said I would only ask the Senator one more question but I have one more My question is you didnt do those bills on the fly where you were amending them saying OK we cant quite find 60 lets go back to a closed room and lets rebuild the bill You built them over a long period of time You did a good job of working the problems out together and then you built it as it went along You didnt say OK lets do it on the fly lets change this lets change that You build a solid piece of legislation and move it forward not changing it at the 11th hour as we are seeing take place now I thank my colleague from Utah for that explanation and also for the years of service he has given and particularly a lot of focus on health care issues I havent always agreed with my colleague from Utah I have always found him though very sound in his thinking very knowledgeable in his ways in knowing how you do this and particularly when you are talking about health care these are bipartisan issues in and of themselves and they need to be in this body He also talked about the principles of federalism which I think we have deviated from in what we see from this bill I wish to read from the Constitution article I section 8 That is the piece I wish to focus on here for a minute about the constitutional question involved in this health care bill Article I section 8 reads simply this way that the Congress shall haveand then it lists a series of enumerated powers power to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations and among the several States and with the Indian tribes That is our ability to regulate commerce with the foreign nations among the several States and with the Indian tribes There are a number of people raising the question about whether you can constitutionally require everybody in the United States by virtue of their citizenship or status in the United States to have health insurance I think it is highly questionable It appears to me from several legal scholars that this is unconstitutional for us to do It is a major plank in the health care legislation that has been brought forward by the Democratic majority and I do not believe it is going to stand constitutional challenge I want to develop that for my colleagues here today The Congressional Budget Office said this about the constitutional question here They said forcing individuals to buy insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action Those are big words in a time when we are seeing a lot of what I think are unprecedented Federal actions Then going on to say The Government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the United States You would be requiring as a condition for lawful residence in the United States the purchasing of a good or a servicein this case health insurance As laudable as some people may look at that or say that is that would be what is being required The Congressional Budget Office does not know of any time where a person in the United States has been required to buy any good or service as a condition simply of lawful residence in the United States I think it raises significant constitutional questions You have to remember as everybody does but I think we have to remind ourselves because too often we act as if we dont remember that the Federal Government is a constitutional government of limited powers From James Madison in the Federalist Papers quoted often but it bears repeating because it is a foundational issue In the first place it is to be remembered that the general government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws Its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects Which is what I just read from in article I section 8 Chief Justice John Marshall in the famous Marbury v Madison case stated The powers of the legislature are defined and limited and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten the Constitution is written We cant violate that The Federal Government is limited to enumerated powers granted by the Constitution The Founding Fathers who drafted and ratified the Constitution were unwavering in their desire to restrict the powers of States and limit the powers of Congress To achieve their goal they created a system that splits State and Federal authority so that one government Federal or State does not maintain too much power over the liberty of the American people Therefore the Framers created a system with a legislature of limited and enumerated powers the Congress to enact laws which shall be necessary and proper for the execution of powers One of those is the commerce clause I just read which grants Congress the authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations among the several States interstate commerce and with Indian tribes Many have used the commerce clause to justify the implementation of this unconstitutional mandate Those individuals often cite the case of Wicker v Filburn a 1942 case The US Supreme Court decision found that a law prohibiting a commercial farmer growing an additional acre of wheat to feed chickens beyond the limits imposed on wheat production mandated by the Federal Government was constitutional and fell under the enumerated powers granted by the commerce clause Filburn was ordered to destroy his crops and pay a fine to the government for being too productive The Supreme Court interpreting the Constitutions commerce clause decided that Filburns wheat growing activities reduced the amount of wheat he would buy for chicken feed on the open market and affected interstate commerce and thus could be regulated by the Federal Government However that Supreme Court decision agree with it or not still does not expand the powers of this body under the commerce clause to impose a monetary fine or penalty upon a citizen who fails to purchase or enter into a private contract for health insurance That doesnt expand our authority under the commerce clause It doesnt change the commerce clause For us to require somebody to do something simply as a status of citizenship the Congressional Research Service says Despite the breadth of powers exercised under the Commerce Clause it is unclear whether the clause would provide a solid constitutional foundation for legislation containing a requirement to have health insurance Whether such a requirement would be constitutional under the Commerce Clause is perhaps the most challenging question posed by such a proposal as it is a novel issue whether Congress may use this clause to require an individual to purchase a good or a service To think that the Federal Government can compel any individual to purchase a commodity because that individual is alive and breathing is unconstitutional and is at least a novel issue that this 25 trillion proposal is built around Should we be doing this major change in health care 25 trillion in spending 12 trillion in reduction in Medicare 12 trillion raising in taxes off of a novel constitutional question involved in the inherent piece of it that being the requirement for everybody to have health insurance I think not Along with all the other problems with it I think it has an enormous constitutional question right in the middle of it And what if you pull that out and the Supreme Court says ultimately you cant require that Then you have done 25 trillion 12 trillion in Medicare cuts 12 trillion in tax increases and your core piece is pulled out it is unconstitutional Then the whole house of cards falls apart Another popular argument for forcing citizens to purchase health insurance under penalty of law is that States require people to buy car insurance This argument is not only constitutionally flawed but also an underwhelming argument that in many respects hardly deserves comment and adds little to the debate It is recognized that States maintain inherent police powers to regulate behavior and enforce order within their borders to promote public welfare security health and safety This is a fundamental difference between the power of States and the enumerated powers of the national government such as commerce between States and Indian tribes This is a much broader granting of jurisdiction to the States State vehicle insurance laws are exactly that laws implemented by States and are generally derived from State constitutions and not the Federal Constitution under which this body operates Furthermore these laws require an individual who voluntarily participates in the use of an automobile to insure that vehicle It is not a right of citizenship as a Kansan that you have to buy auto insurance But if you want to operate a car on our roads you have to have auto insurance It isnt a requirement of citizenship We are requiring this as an article of citizenship You have to have health insurance a novel and enormously expansive role of the Federal Government The Federal mandate for the purchase of health insurance forces individuals to purchase a commodity not because they choose to participate in an economic or commercial activity such as what one would think would be covered under the commerce clause but forces an individual to purchase a product simply because that person exists This mandate is an abuse of the power granted to this Congress by the Constitution Last night I spent some time developing another thought that I think is an important one for us to consider It is one this body has spent some time over the last decade dealing with that is the removal of the marriage penalty from our Tax Code which we havent gotten very far in doing but getting the marriage penalty out the thought being that marriage is a good institution It is a fabulous institution for the formation of family It is something that has an enormous role in our culture and society and should be rewarded and should not be taxed The fundamental principle exists if you want less of something tax it if you want more of something subsidize it In the Democratic health care bill there are marriage penalties on both lowincome and upper income individuals that will reduce the incidence of marriage in this society under the principle that if you are going to tax something you will get less of it This bill has marriage penalty taxes in it I want to go through a series of these starting with the high cost plan tax the Cadillac insurance plan Married couples under this bill are hit hardest by the high cost plans tax The number of single and married tax filers is equal but married taxpayers pay more than twice as much as singles as a percent of new tax revenue in this bill So if you are married filing jointly you will pay 62 percentsingle filers 25 percentin this bill Is that something we want to do Do we want to say if you are married you will pay more of the tax Most people would say We want to encourage marriage and the formation of family around marriage We should have these at least equal or maybe do a higher tax on the other end But most would say lets have these be equal Instead in this we have a huge increase in the amount of money married filers will have to pay as compared to taxes paid by single filers Consequently you encourage people to say Lets not get married because we dont want to pay the increase in taxes The high cost plans tax the Cadillac plans tax will hit married couples households far more severely than single filers Even though the number of married filers and single filers is roughly equal the high cost plans tax will impact the total tax bill of married couples much more severely 25 percent of the revenue will be from single filers 62 percent of the bill will go to married filers One thing is certain 62 percent of married couples households dont make more than 250000 So not only is this unfair to married households it is a direct contradiction of the Presidents promise that you wouldnt pay more taxes if you were making below 250000 In this case you do under the Cadillac insurance plan proposal or piece in this proposal I want to look at another chart on this subject If we wanted to talk about factors that impact an individuals decision to enter the workforce or to invest in a business an important factor is the marginal tax rate they will face on the next dollar they earn Basically it is a question of whether it is worth the effort and risk to work What is my marginal tax If I work longer and make another 100 how much do I get to keep The marginal tax rate This is an especially important factor for lowincome households people who dont have much marginal income to work off of They need every dollar they can get So if you are going to tax their marginal rate they are looking at this saying I dont want to get in that category I need to hold back from getting in that category We have tried to help the less economically fortunate with various types of support programs TANF food stamps the earnedincome tax credit the additional child tax credit to name a few Lowincome families already face high marginal tax rates as a result of the phaseout of their benefits and tax rates that mean the loss of benefits they get under TANF food stamps the earnedincome tax credit housing assistance the welfare package we put together for lowincome individuals Lowincome families already face high marginal tax rates as a result of the phaseout of their benefits These phaseouts already impose significant barriers to marriage In other words whenever you get a combined income of a lowincome couple you lose more benefits Consequently people dont get married because they look and say I will lose my health benefits if I get married I will lose my medical benefits my housing benefits I may lose food stamps I will not get married Yet you look at the chances for children in that situation to get out of poverty their best chance is to have a stable mom and dad and a stable marriage environment providing for the comfort and support of those children Our incentives are disincentives toward marriage in this way and they are built even more significantly into this health care bill As an example lets take two individuals at 150 percent of the poverty level After the new subsidies proposed in this legislation are taken into account these two individuals would pay 1478 for their health insurance But if they get married their bill will increase to 2308 a marriage penalty of 830 if you are at the 150 percent of poverty level or below If you are at 150 percent of poverty or below you dont have marginal income to mess around with You need everything you have just to provide the basics So if you are looking at this increase in the marriage penalty of 830 you are saying We cant afford to get married Is that the signal we want to send from the Federal Government No Everybody in this body would say that Lets take a pair of individuals earning 250 percent of the poverty level One has no children the other has two children Unmarried they will after subsidies pay 5865 for their health coverage If they decide to marry they will face a penalty of 2050 Lets turn to the new Medicare tax that will go into effect in 2013 The tax will apply to wage and salary income as well as certain business income for individuals The tax will apply to income of that type for above 200000 for individuals and 250000 for joint filers The penalty is obvious on its face Lets take an example Two unmarried individuals earn 200000 each and their total Medicare taxes would be 11600 But if they get married the penalty is 750 Or take two individuals one making 150000 and the other 200000 Single their Medicare taxes total 10150 if they get married they will pay an additional 500 This is on top of the marriage penalties that two earners face under current law The marriage penalty is there I dont think it is as significant as for the lowincome individuals but it is here as well My point is why on Earth would that even be built into the base of the bill particularly on the lowincome couples Why on Earth would you build in a marriage penalty on people who cant afford it If combined income is over 250000 you can afford another 500 I am willing to agree with that But not this couple that is making at 150 percent of poverty or 250 percent of poverty one with two kids They cant afford that Why on Earth would you build it into this This is ridiculous that it be placed in the proposal It makes no sense Creating and expanding on the penalties for marriage makes zero sense Families are a critical determinant of the wellbeing of our society Family structure also has a significant impact on economic wellbeing on education and the effect on the social fabric of this Nation is positive It is a fundamental law of economics that when you tax something you get less of it Why would we tax marriage particularly for lowincome individuals when it is the best chance for those children involved with this couple to have a stable environment if they will form a solid marriage unit And we are going to tax it and discourage it That is wrong That is wrong as a policy matter There is a number of other problems I have had with this overall bill This piece of it absolutely makes no sense to me why we would do something like this I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill to take these sorts of things out to take them out of the base law Unfortunately in the United States today this is kind of repeating what already takes place in food stamps what takes place in health benefits for lowincome individuals right now They cannot afford to get married or they lose their benefits It is ridiculous We ought to give people bonuses for getting married not penalties for getting married Now we are going to add to it by putting it in this health insurance bill It is wrong and it is bad policy Mr President I yield the floor 
S_WA_MURRAY,2009-12-17,1993_2009,0247, President I come to the floor on behalf of over 10000 constituents from my home State of Washington who have sent me letters and emails over the past 6 months to tell me their stories and their struggles with our health care system I come to the floor on behalf of the thousands who do not have the time or who do not have the resources to write to me and ask for help but who are struggling as well I come to the floor on behalf of small business owners parents senior citizens and people with preexisting conditions people with insurance whose premiums are skyrocketing and people without insurance who spend their nights praying they do not have an accident or fall ill These people are all worried about keeping their jobs or making a mortgage payment and for whom the cost of getting sick today or being dropped from their health care plan or opening their mail to see another premium increase is too much to bear Those are the people who deserve a real debate and a real plan not distortions or silly distractions such as conversations about how many pages are in this health care bill What is more important than the number of pages in this health care bill is the help within those pages for businesses and families across this country I have watched day after day as our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have come down to this floor They have made outrageous claims They have handed out reams of paper and stacked copies of the Senate bill on top of copies of the House bill to try and turn a serious debate into a sideshow But if my colleagues on the other side want to focus on pages fine lets focus on pages Beside me is a photo of a woman named Doreen Kelsey In front of Doreen is a stack of papers Those are hundreds upon hundreds of pages of forms and rejection letters and appeals and denials from her insurance company These are pages that have taken hours and hours to fill out and that have stood between Doreens husband and the care he desperately needed I met Doreen at a roundtable I hosted in August in Spokane WA in my State Doreen told me she is selfemployed and isnt able to purchase her own health insurance because she has a preexisting condition Now luckily she and her family have health insurance coverage through her husband Tonys employer She told me she and Tony thought their family had good insurance coverage But when he asked for a colonoscopy they soon discovered the lengths to which insurance companies will go to deny to delay and to dispute the care families such as the Kelseys assumed were included in their coverage Their insurance carrier told them before they would pay for this preventive care it would have to be approved by a primary care physician After being delayed for more than a month because of that requirementand this whole stack of papers herethe colonoscopy ultimately confirmed their fears and he was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer With that diagnosis in hand the Kelseys were determined to beat this terrible disease together but rather than focusing on fighting cancer they were forced to fight their insurance company Doreen told me although they had faithfully paid their premiums throughout their entire working lives now that Tony desperately needed lifesaving treatment he was in a constant struggle of paperwork with his insurance company to pay for even routine care They werent asking for anything new they werent asking for anything experimental they were just asking for the care that a lifetime of paid premiums should have entitled them to The Kelseys assumed what most Americans do when they are paying for good health insurance They assumed that while their insurance was expensive it would be there for them when they needed it Well Doreen and her family like many other American families and businesses have come to find out that in our current health care insurance system stability is sometimes nothing more than an illusion With each procedure and each battle the Kelseys faced a new fight more paperwork stacked on more paperwork another appeal and another appeal At one point Doreen told me she had to appeal all the way to the State insurance regulator just to get a corrected explanation of benefits formpaperworkfrom her insurance company She told me they had to borrow thousands of dollars to pay doctors while their claims were tied up in what seemed like an endless appeal processpaperwork The Kelseys insurance now costs more than their mortgage and they are constantly worried that Tonys employer will drop that coverage But thankfully she told me Tony is working hard and successfully battling his cancer In the meantime Doreen has successfully been battling her insurance company But this isnt how our system should work When we pass the Senates health care reform bill we are debating it will not be Let me tell everyoneand the Kelseyshow our bill will help them First of all our bill ends insurance company discrimination for preexisting conditions so Doreen will be able to purchase insurance on her own and not have to rely on her husbands employer Doreen would also have access to a number of different plans through an exchange that we are setting up where insurance companies for the first time would have to compete for her business Our plan would inject competition into the insurance market and we know that will lower costs and give families such as Doreens more choices Our plan also makes it illegal for insurance companies to drop people when they get sick so Doreen and Tony wouldnt have to worry about losing their coverage at the moment they need it the most Since we know that preventive care is critical to saving lives and saving money on health care costs in the long term our bill ensures free preventive services under all insurance plans Our plan invests in prevention and in public health to encourage innovations in health care that prevent illness and disease before they require more costly treatment It would have allowed Tony to get a colonoscopy when he first needed it so he could get his treatment started sooner Mr President we also know families deserve the security and stability of knowing that if they or their loved one do get sick they will not be forced into bankruptcy to pay for the cost Our bill restricts the arbitrary limits that insurance companies currently place on the amount of coverage families receive It caps the total amount that insurance companies can make people pay out of pocket on copays and deductibles And it eliminates the lifetime limits insurance companies can impose on coverage In addition to putting in place those important consumer protections that would help people such as Doreen and Tony it will give families the stability and security they deserve and lower the cost of care so Americans such as Tony and Doreen would not have coverage that costs as much or more than their mortgage We do that by putting in place premium rate reviews to track increases and crack down on excessive insurance company overhead costs When our bill passesand I am confident it will despite the delay and the delay and the delay that we are seeing on the other side of the aisleinsurance companies will no longer be able to hike up Doreens premiums to pay for a bureaucracy they will then put to work battling her claims We also provide sliding scale premium tax creditstax creditsfor families who still cant afford coverage which would help 450000 people in my home State of Washington get the coverage they need Mr President the bill before us todaywhich some of my colleagues have sitting on their desks and they bring out here on a daily basis to show us the pageswill help families such as the Kelseys That is what is within the pages of the bill they keep throwing at us So I think rather than talking about the number of pages in the bill our colleagues on the other side of the aisle might actually want to talk about what is in the bill because right now instead of debating the merits of bringing down costs or protecting families from losing the coverage when they get sick our colleagues are actually spending time complaining this bill has too many pages I ask the Presiding Officer and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to take a look at this photo of Doreen sitting next to hundreds and hundreds of pages of correspondence and appeals and fights with her insurance company These are the pages we ought to be talking about These are the pages that impact peoples lives and the Kelseys are the people we ought to be talking about So when my colleagues come down here and complain about the number of pages in our health reform billthose pages that will help our families and businesses lower costsI want them to think about the number of pages right here in front of Doreen These are pages that have caused the Kelseys unimaginable heartache and these are the pages that have come between them and the health care they paid for These are the numbers we ought to be focusing onthe 14000 people who are losing coverage every day These are the numbers we ought to be focusing onthe 51 million people who have no insurance Those are the numbers we ought to be focusing on not the number of pages in the bill Mr President we have to end the politics end the delay and the partisanship We need to end this obstruction because that is what the Kelseys faced every day delay and obstruction They are facing it again on the floor of the Senate It is time for us to come together on this important bill and bring our businesses and our families the insurance reform they have been asking for I hope that is what Americans will remember at the end of the day that the pages in this bill are going to change their lives so they dont have to fight their insurance companies again Mr President we are here today in the Senatenobody on the floor just me talking about what we ought to be doing and you in the Chair waiting Why Because we have a Defense appropriations bill in front of the Senate It is a Defense appropriations bill that needs to be passed by the end of this year It needs to be passed so we can get back on the floor and pass our health care reform bill Some people on the other side of the aisle have decided that delaying this Defense bill will somehow help them delay this from ever being passedthe health care bill that would help Doreen and her family Well Mr President it isnt just about making a political point What we are doing is having our soldierswho are serving on the ground in Iraq in Afghanistan around the globe and here in our countrywonder what they are going to get for Christmasa delay from the Senate The bill in front of us provides a 34percent military pay increase This is an AllVolunteer Force we have out there working for us Many of them are away from their families this Christmas They do not want to hear that the Senate is delaying passing this important bill that will give them the security they need because of political obstruction in order to delay a health care bill This Defense bill is critically important It has very important support for our military and their families It has passed through this Senate before and we are ready now to make the final trip to the White House which needs to be done by the way by tomorrow So I hope our colleagues will not continue to delay I hope they will allow us to move to final passage on this bill so our men and women who are serving us in the military and around the globe know there is a Senate who is working for them I have heard some of them on the other side complain that some things were added to the Senate Defense billthat also need to be done by the end of the year besides the Defense billsuch as making sure our families whose benefits are running out for unemployment or COBRA for health care insurance get a 2month extension So should our Christmas present to them be Sorry you arent going to get your small little help as we end this year We want to keep that going for another 3 months during one of the worst economic times we have seen So of course we put it in this bill Because of the obstruction on the other side we cant get it through in a timely fashion It has to be done by the end of this year We are doing the right thing for our families We are doing the right thing for our military by putting it in this bill and getting it done and to the President so we can finish our work Mr President these are all critical issues We are all tired We have been here day after day after day It is time to get this done Let me tell you why Because Doreen and her husband are facing piles and piles of paperwork to care for her husband They are fighting their insurance company And all we have to do is put these bills in front of us get them done and provide some relief for America I hope that is what we focus on Mr President I hope we stop the deny and delay and obstruction that the Kelseys have had to fight with their insurance company Lets move these bills and go home to our families for Christmas Mr President I yield the floor

0175; 0176; 0177; 0178, And we believe that the Atlantic and Pacific are in a cooling period Something called a PSO and an AMO or something I would now like to yield to one of the most informed Congressmen on the issue of climate change the Honorable John Linder of the great State of Georgia Im told this you probably know that there are more glaciers in the world that are growing than there are that are in decline I know its dangerous for Congressmen to actually think We are not accused of doing that very often but there are sometimes some Congressmen you and I I think are two not that others dont but we actually think Now I want to build on what you just said These ice core samples that you got the data that show temperature goes up and then COINF2INF goes up And if temperature were to go down then COINF2INF would go down That means that temperature is the dominant variable and that it drives the dependent variable which is COINF2INF Temperature goes up and then COINF2INF goes up So Vice President Gore is only off by 180 degrees We are in a situation right now where it appears it depends on the data that you believe but if the data points that we think are correct are correct we are in a cooling period Temperature has gone down at least 8 years in a row and probably 12 years in a row and we appear to be in a cooling period But at the same time we have to admit that COINF2INF concentrations are going up So I would hypothesize that the COINF2INF concentrations going up are going to prevent as much cooling and it will keep the planet warmer than it would be otherwise but still cooler overall which would be a good thing for mankind We dont want another ice age do we Markey before you yield back could you answer a question if you still have time We have a fundamental difference on the data which is part of what our Special Order is going to be We have verifiable data that the temperature has gone down the last 11 years in a row and yet you alluded to some data points about the hottest years on record and stuff I mean how do we reconcile that We cant say the temperature has gone down 11 years in a row and you have data that says 2005 was the second hottest year on record and all of that I mean how do we reconcile these data points I mean is there a way a methodology that we can supply our data and you can supply your data and we can try to reconcile them I mean the facts ought to be the facts We can have different opinions but we ought to agree on what the facts are Are those data points public Well one of the things that I hope we can agree we can have different opinions different views on issues but between you as chairman of the Climate Committee and Mr Waxman as chairman of the Energy Committee and Mr Sensenbrenner who is your ranking member and myself who is the ranking member on Energy we should be able to get a data set that we both agree is what the facts are and I would like your cooperation in doing that Our data sets that Im going to allude to are different Now I know enough to know what I dont know And I dont know if thats a surface temperature I dont know if thats a tropospheric temperature in the upper atmosphere I dont know if thats a local temperature thats some sort of an annual mean There are all kinds of different ways to describe it and to calculate it but we ought to agree as policy leaders on a way to get a data set that everybody says then we are going to debate the implications of that data set whatever it is And I hope that you and Mr Waxman We are going to introduce in our Special Order some serious concerns that some of the scientists that maintain these data sets manipulate change and eliminate for their own conclusions And again its very fair to have an opinion and have a scientific debate but it shouldnt be fair to manipulate the data in a way that at best is disingenuous or in some cases deceitful and I hope you would agree with that I encourage you to listen and if you wish to stay and maybe participate in our Special Order you would be welcome Madam Speaker I do think that I will use the 1 hour I understand theres going to be a rule reported in the time and well certainly yield to the person from the Rules Committee to file that rule Madam Speaker I wish to rise to discuss a topic thats already been discussed on the House floor this evening Its the issue of climate change or global warming Next week I am honored to be one of the congressional delegation attending the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen Denmark thats going to be led by our esteemed Speaker the Honorable Nancy Pelosi I also attended Kyoto Buenos Aires and The Hague Im the ranking Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee and formerly also on the Science Committee and I have been a participant at the congressional level on the climate change debate for the last 20 years Im going to start off by putting into the Record a suppressed report that Congressman Poe just talked about that has never before this evening been made public in its entire unexpurgated form The title of the report is Comments on the Draft Technical Support Document for the Endangerment Analysis for Greenhouse Gas Emissions under the Clean Air Act This report was compiled by Dr Alan Carlin who is a career scientist and investigator at the EPA At one time he selfdescribed himself Im told as a global warming believer He prepared this report He works in a group within the EPA that is responsible for conducting an internal review of some of these draft orders before they go public And Im not going to read the entire report Im going to read excerpts of the preface and the executive summary and then I will put the entire report into the Record This is from the executive summary and the preface and I quote We have become increasingly concerned that EPA has itself paid too little attention to the science of global warming EPA and others have tended to accept the findings reached by outside groups particularly the IPCC which is the International Protocol on Climate Change under the auspices of the United Nations and the CCSP as being correct without a careful and critical examination of their conclusions and documentation If they should be found to be incorrect at a later date however the EPA is found not to have made a really careful independent review of them before reaching its decision on endangerment it appears likely that it is the EPA rather than these other groups that may be blamed for any errors Further down on the executive summary Page 1 Our conclusions do represent the best science in the sense of most closely corresponding to available observations that we currently know of however and are sufficiently at variance with those of the IPCC CCSP and the Draft TSD that we believe they support our increasing concern that the EPA has not critically reviewed the findings by these groups Further we believe our concerns and reservations are sufficiently important to warrant a serious review of the science by EPA before any attempt is made to reach conclusions on the subject of endangerment from greenhouse gases And on Page 2 What is actually noteworthy is not the relative apparent scientific shine of the two sidesthose that oppose and those that support the global warming argumentbut rather the relative ease with which major holes have been found in the greenhouse gasCOINF2INFglobal warming argument In many cases the most important arguments are based not on multimillion dollar research efforts but by simple observation of available data which has surprisingly received little scrutiny The best example of this is the MSU satellite data on global temperatures Simple scrutiny of this data yields what to us are stunning observations Yet this has received surprisingly little study or at least publicity In the end it must be emphasized that the issue is not which side has spent the most money or published the most peerreviewed papers or been supported by more scientific organizations This is very important the next sentence The issue is whether the greenhouse gasCOINF2INFAGW hypothesis meets the ultimate scientific testconformance with real world data What these comments show is that it is this ultimate test that the hypothesis fails That the hypothesis fails This is why EPA needs to carefully reexamine the science behind global warming before proposing an endangerment finding Now this is from Dr Carlin in the EPA This is not some disgruntled Republican Congressman This is a professional scientist PhD in an office within the EPA that is tasked with reviewing this endangerment document before a final decision is made And in his words the ultimate test is whether the greenhouse gas COINF2INF hypothesis meets the ultimate scientific test conformance with real world data These comments show that it is the ultimate test that the hypothesis fails Further on Page 3 of the executive summary there are several principal comments that they wish to raise in their review As of the best information we currently haveand this was in March of 2009 the greenhouse gasCOINF2INF hypothesis as the cause of global warming which the Draft TSD supports is currently an invalid hypothesis from a scientific viewpoint because it fails a number of critical comparisons with available observable data Any one of these failings should be enough to invalidate the hypothesis the breadth of these failings leaves no other possible conclusion based on current data As Feynman said in 1975 failure to conform to real world data makes it necessary from a scientific viewpoint to revise the hypothesis or abandon it Unfortunately this has not happened in the global warming debate but needs to if an accurate finding concerning endangerment is to be made The failings listed below why we should not have an endangerment finding in order of importance in our view Number 1 the lack of observed upper tropospheric heating in the tropics Number 2 the lack of observed constant humidity levels Number 3 the most reliable sets of global temperature data we have using satellite microwave sounding units show no appreciable temperature increases during the critical period from 1978 to 1997 Satellite data after 1998 is also inconsistent with the greenhouse gas COINF2INFAGW hypothesis Number 4 the models used by the IPCC do not take into account or show the most important ocean oscillations which clearly do affect global temperatures Number 5 the models in the IPCC ignored the possibility of indirect solar variability Number 6 the models in the IPCC ignored the possibility that there may be other significant natural effects on global temperatures Number 7 surface global temperature data may have been hopelessly corrupted by the urban heat island effect Now this one is the one that I was asking Mr Markey about to see where he got his data set because surface global temperature if you take it in downtown Manhattan for example is going to be very different than if you take a surface temperature in a rural area The actual urban effect the concrete the asphalt the buildings raise the temperature and there is some concern that this urban heat island effect has corrupted the temperature Those are just seven reasons in this draft document why this author had skepticism about going forward with an endangerment finding And yet this report was not made a part of the record This report was not made public In fact this report was suppressed and because of considerable anxiety on the part of people like myself and Congressman Issa Congressman Sensenbrenner the author was allowed to put a redacted version of this report on his personal Web site Then we were able to get the unredacted version provided to us by the EPA and thats the version that Im going to put in the Record As this author says Dr Carlin he was prophetic because were now seeing that some of the climatologistsmaybe more than somehave attempted to suppress certain data to destroy data sets to manipulate data sets to not get a true scientific review but to reach a preconceived conclusion Madam Speaker I think that is wrong I will yield to the distinguished member of the Rules Committee I thank the gentleman for bringing that to our attention and it sounds like a worthy proposal I would like to yield such time as he may consume to a member of the committee from the great State of Illinois Mr Shimkus Mr SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks When was that email Was that 10 years ago Was that a decade ago When was that Phil Jones he is the head of the Climate Research Unit at East Anglia University in Great Britain Is he the gentleman that just resigned And is Michael Mann the professor at Penn State that is the proponent initially of the hockey stick theory which has been shown to be discredited and was actually using data sets that were manipulated in a way that they shouldnt have done Those are the two gentleman the author and the recipients of this email And are these two gentlemen two of the leading proponents in the IPCC that climate is growing warmer because of manmade COINF2INF emissions Now my assumption and this is an assumption is that the gentleman that wrote those emails and that received them by and large are in the inner circle of the climate change community and in all probability they are in Copenhagen right now And if the President were to commit the United States to a legislative path that these scientists support and if we were to adopt as law the climate change bill that passed the House that requires a reduction of 83 percent of emissions from COINF2INF manmade sources 2005 by the year 2050 and we implemented that we would have a COINF2INF emissions level in this country that we last experienced in 1910 And if we do it on a per capita basis that we last experienced per person in 1875 is it the gentlemans position that if we were to do that our lifestyle in the year 2050 would be anywhere comparable to where it is today If it were the floor of the House would be a toxic waste dump because there is more COINF2INF created here than in any other size room in the country with the exception of perhaps the Senate floor But it would have been a little warmer than it is today We might not have been comfortable wearing a woolen sweater back then All I know is when people retire they move to Florida and Texas One of whom just resigned from his position in East Anglia It would be similar if we held an election and if we just said Assume that I won But we didnt release the documents and we didnt release the ballots and we didnt let them be audited and we didnt have a canvassing committee We just said Well assume that since Congressman Linder says he won he did win Well they should be in the public domain anyway We want to now turn to the Congressman from New Orleans Louisiana a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee Congressman Scalise The AR4 data set is the data set that was used in the IPCC report in 2007 so its a seminal document that has been used for policymaking decisions not just in the United States but all over the world What you are saying is they went to some lengths to manipulate the data that that report is based on May I ask the Chair how much time we have remaining in our Special Order At about 10 minutes to go I have got some documents I want to put in the Record I want to thank Congressman Scalise Congressman Linder and Congressman Shimkus for participating in this Special Order What we are attempting to do is to actually use the scientific method to determine what steps if any the United States Government should take policywise if in fact climate change or global warming is a major problem that needs to be addressed It does appear in my opinion that there is reasonable doubt about whether we should take some of the radical steps that have been espoused in the climate change bills which have passed the House and which are pending in the Senate I want to take the remaining time and go through a series of emails that have just become publicweve alluded to themand go into a little more depth The first email which we have already alluded to is from Michael Mann Michael Mann is a climatologist at Penn State University He is one of the leading scientists in the IPCC He is the author of the original hockey stick theory that is kind of the genesis the seminal document for the theory that manmade COINF2INF is the cause of the climate warming in the world This is a document from him to Phil Jones who was until recently the head of the Climate Research Unit at East Anglia University in Great Britain Now Dr Jones resigned in the last week or so but in it he says Can you delete any emails that youve have had with KeithKeith is Keith Briffaregarding AR4 AR4 is a UN IPCC fourth assessment document from 2007 Its one of these policy documents that is used around the world You can see that he says I am going to contact Gene about this Okay Gene is actually Eugene Wahl He is at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations office in Boulder Colorado Thats with the US Department of Commerce He said I am going to contact Gene about this Can you delete any emails that you have Ill get Caspar to do likewise Caspar is Caspar JonesI mean Caspar Ammann He is at the National Center for Atmospheric Research or NCAR in Boulder Colorado Its a federally supported consortium So in this email we have collaboration between NOAA NCARboth in the United Statesthe Climate Research Unit which is CRU in East Anglia Great Britain and many prominent IPCC contributors coordinating document destruction I think that is something that policymakers here in the United States should be concerned about Now lets go to the next document email No 2 Now the first one was from Michael Mann to Phil Jones This is from Phil Jones to a gentleman named Tom Wigley Its subject is Schles suggestion This is last year December of 2008 It says I am supposed to go through my emails and he can get anything Ive written about him About 2 months ago I deleted loads of emails so we have very little if anything at all So what this is showing is or one could say they have conspired to delete data This is of Ben Santer who is Santer 1 who is a prominent climate modeler at the Department of Energys Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and of Tom Wigley who is a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder Colorado The gist of this is he has already deleted a lot of emails from 2 months ago What are they trying to hide here Now lets go to email number 3 Email number 3 shows an unprecedented data purge at the CRU in East Anglia Great Britain Here is a public index of documents on one day and then here is the public index on the next very quickly after they have gone through and purged all purged all of this It says the next day on July 28 Phil Jones deleted data from his public files leaving online a variety of files from the 1990s This morning everything in Dr Phils directory had been removed Its not just the emails that have been deleted in a widely reported event Steve MCIntyre who is a Canadian researcher who testified before Congress several years ago when I was chairman and who has been attempting to get these data sets to get these documents he has been trying to get through the Freedom of Information Act the public documents that some of these studies are purported to be based upon Instead of releasing them they purged them They took them away in what is reported to be an unprecedented data purge They have deleted files pertaining to station data from the public directories Why Where are the data now if they are still in existence What is it they are trying to hide If the temperature data records really proved their theory they would want to publicize them At least I would think that they would Lets go to number 4 This is an email from Phil Jones who we know well now to a gentleman named Neville Nicholls Mr Nicholls lets see Mr Nicholls I am not sure who Mr Nicholls is but here it says I hope I dont get a call from Congress I am hoping that no one there realizes I have a US Department of Energy grant and have had this with Tom W for the past 25 years This is back in 2005 This is when I was chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and we were conducting the investigation into Dr Manns hockey stick proposal hockey stick theory and we had asked for some documents from Professor Mann or Dr Mann and this gentleman is saying we hope the Congress doesnt realize that we are getting Federal money we dont want them to be asking us about documents Of course as we now know they have destroyed many of those documents or apparently have destroyed many of those documents Lets go to number 5 Now this documents shows the lengths to which they will go to suppress information says if they ever hear that there is a Freedom of Information Act now in the UK I think I will delete these rather than send them to anyone Now Congressman Markey who is a good friend of mine and who is a believer a proponent of manmade global warming has got data sets that he says justify some of the policies that he supports But here we see that some of these documents and some of these data sets that Mr Markey and others havewho sincerely believe that there is a problem appear to be very suspect In fact they are so suspect that if they have to release them publicly they would rather delete them than to comply with the Freedom of Information Act Tom Wigley had sent me a worried email when he heard about it He thought that people might ask him for his model code My heavens you know Keep in mind that this theory that mankindmade COINF2INF emissions is driving the temperature upwards its just that its a theory These researchers have built these models to try to replicate the planets temperature mechanism and all these models show the temperature going up But thats the conclusion that the modelers want It is not factually correct to say the temperature is going up its factually correct to say the modelers who want to prove that the temperature is going up are putting variables and assumptions in these models that drive them up but they apparently dont have the data to back that up Lets go to number 6 This is again from Mr Jones a gentleman named Gavin Schmidt concerning the revised version of something called the Wengen paper Wengen It says all of our Freedom of Information officers have been in discussions and are now using the same exceptions not to respondthe advice that they got from the information commissioner The Freedom of Information line that we are using is that the IPCCnow keep in mind the IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeis funded primarily by the US taxpayer not exclusively but primarily is exempt from any countrys Freedom of Information because the skeptics have been told this Even though we possibly hold relevant information that the IPCC is not part of our remit ie mission statement therefore we dont have an obligation to pass it on To me thats just irresponsible to say that the IPCC which is a total governmental agency admittedly through the UN and a large number of nations but the US as the primary funder is above Federal Freedom of Information laws not only in the United States but in every other country This information that has been collected and paid for by US taxpayers and funded by US scientists is now out of reach of the US taxpayer I think thats just flat wrong Madam Speaker My last email is number 7 and this shows while they accuse people like myself of trying to be bullies and to ostracize people here is an email where again this Professor Mann Michael its to Michael Mann from a gentleman named Malcolm Hughes just a heads up apparently the contrarians now have an in with GRL GRL which is the Geophysical Research Letters a prominent climate journalthis guy Sayers has a prior connection with the University of Virginia Department of Environmental Sciences that causes me some unease Then later onthis is truly awful If you think that Sayers is in the greenhouse skeptics camp then if we can find documentary evidence of this we could go through official ATU channels to get him ousted They are trying to ostracize those that are honest enough to say that they have some doubts about the theory I will end with this The theory of global warming caused by mankind is just that it is a theory it is not a fact As US taxpayers and as the guardians of the US taxpayers we should demand that the facts be made public so that we can make a relevant policy decision

0045; 0046; 0047; 0048; 0049; 0050; 0051; 0052, And we have now 3400 instruments that go into the oceans And every 10 days they pop up and they give satellites information of what is on those instruments about the temperatures And there has been no warming in the oceans In the last 2 million years we have had 20 ice ages 20 glaciations the last on average about 100000 years interrupted by about 10000 years of warming It has been 11400 years since the last glaciation It is likely the planet is looking toward going cooler again We have had less sun activity in the last 11 years than weve had in many many years I first got interested in this 5 or 6 years ago on a trip to New Zealand It was a congressional delegation We had a visit with the leader of the NOAA point there where they leave to go into Antarctica for their expeditions and come back to this scientific center And they put a PowerPoint presentation together for us and a big chart on the wall that showed that at that time they had dug into the Vostok ice core for 400000 years back and that from 400000 years back to today temperature increases and decreases and COINF2INF increases and decrease were in consonance They moved with each other And I asked him Who was burning fossil fuels 400000 years ago He took that as a rude question and it took me a year to get a copy of that chart But I studied that chart And then I looked at the studies about the Vostok ice core And what you discover when you dont have it on a 812by11 piece of paper and expanded is that temperature changes precede COINF2INF changes by about 1000 years One study says 800 years one study says 2800 years but people average it at about 1000 years We are prepared to have that debate right now if the gentleman would yield COINF2INF is a trace gas It is a plant food It is beneficial to all of life COINF2INF is a modest gas Methane is 23 times more powerful at trapping heat Sixtyfive percent of the heattrapping gases come from water vapor We are not going after them because we are going after people What you learn when you discover that COINF2INF levels follow the temperature changes is that theres a reason for it And the reason is this we go through ice ages and global increases and declines in temperature And as the temperature declines globally the trees at the top of the mountain start to die for lack of photosynthesis and then the bushes and then the grasslands And the dust that blows in the winds that are always here blows out across the oceans And part of that dust is lead And when that lead settles to the bottom of the oceans it catalyzes growth in the largest biological mass we have in this planet the plankton And that growth demands COINF2INF to keep going Now the oceans contain 70 times as much COINF2INF as the atmosphere does And as the plant life the plankton pulls that COINF2INF out of the oceans homeostasis or equilibrium causes more COINF2INF to come out of the atmosphere and into the oceans The reverse happens when the planet warms up through more solar activity So colder oceans hold more COINF2INF than warm oceans And when the planet cools off the COINF2INF winds up in the oceans and out of the atmosphere We have 388 parts per million today Will the gentleman yield We heard the gentleman from Massachusetts talk about Big Oil and Saudi Arabia funding all of the opposition I cant find the scientists that are getting those checks But a recent study came out in the last several weeks that says that government money going to climate science on behalf of those who believe in humancause global warming has been 79 billion over the last 20 years They have dwarfed anything on the other side of the issue And they continue to do it Would you suggest that maybe thats why they are continuing to hide this situation because the money keeps coming I believe the number this year is 7 billion from the government But 388 parts per million is not even high Its at the low end of the comfort scale Roughly 65 to 135 million years when the dinosaurs roamed this Earth COINF2INF levels were five and 10 times as high they are today and produced a tremendous amount of greenery that fed those animals 542 million years ago was the Cambrian period It came to be known as the Cambrian explosion because in a very short period of time 5 to 10 million years which in a 412 billionyearold planet is the blink of an eye in that short period of time all of multicellular complex life that has ever existed on this Earth was deposited in the fossil evidence How did that happen That happened because temperatures were warmer The COINF2INF levels were 7000 parts per million 20 times what it is today The entire planet was covered with greenery and had immense amounts of oxygen and all of complex life as we know it 96 percent of which is no longer existent I always like to ask people who tell me the temperature is growing too much to say what should the current temperature be Tell me Should it be the temperature 1000 years ago when Greenland was settled for agriculture Or when the people in Scotland were growing wine grapes Or should it be 879 AD when the Thames froze over Or should it be a little ice age when Greenland was empty of life again COINF2INF is a beneficial trace helpful gas that feeds plants And this whole notion that we should control it somehow is nothing but vanity We are not going to change what is put on this planet for 412 billion years Now we are told and we heard from the gentleman from Massachusetts that there is a scientific consensus He said 98 percent of the scientists tens of thousands agree with his position Well I would like to ask him to produce that list Because only 600 of them shared the Nobel Prize with Al Gore A scientist from Australia has said only 35 people actually wrote the IPCC reports and they were controlled by 10 people He did What is not popularly known is that 32000 scientists including Edward Teller 9000 of whom are PhDs and the rest masters have signed a statement that says there is no evidence that humans are causing any impact on the global warming that occurred between 1975 and 1998 none whatsoever In fact five scientists who contributed to the first IPCC report said in their papers there is no evidence that humans are contributing Those five statements were removed by the top bureaucrat at the IPCC and replaced with one statement that said there is no doubt that humans are causing this He was asked about that under oath in a legal action Why did he remove those statements He said under immense pressure from the top of the Federal Government of the United States Now consensus doesnt mean much in science Consensus is important in politics In science we have to be seeking truth and fact Indeed in science only two conditions are ever obtained One is theory and the other is fact You put forth your theory You release your underlying documents and sources and methods and you let your peers review it and try and replicate it That is the point at which I got very nervous about this science because I tried to get underlying documents from Jim Hansen who had the first computer model He first testified before Congress in 1989 I believe in the Senate He recently attested recently spoke in England He said We have 4 years to save the planet He doesnt release his source documents because he says they are proprietary Well he is an employee of the Federal Government The Federal Government ought to own those documents They ought to be released When somebody is hiding something when somebody is hiding things you begin to wonder why he is hiding it What we are learning from East Angliaand I want to make a point that the gentleman I want to make a point that those are not stolen documents Those documents were released from inside by a whistleblower But somebody working inside that organization realized they were destroying documents that were being asked for in the Freedom of Information Act and someone released those documents I believe that we ought to be thinking about releasing everything Let scientists pour over it and establish whether the theory is actually a fact and move on Will the gentleman yield Sadly that data that the IPCC uses from East Anglia is also the basis of the data that NASA uses in Huntsville Alabama and all of the other future models that have been built have been somehow shaped by that data So there is no place to go now since all of the source documents have been thrown away to reconstruct all of that The data that you are talking about and that we are acting on in this country with capandtrade is also the data being used in Copenhagen today as we speak to begin what Al Gore called the ultimate reason for all of this global governance turning over the sovereignty of the United States to an unelected bureaucracy and the United Nations 
S_IL_BURRIS,2009-12-17,2009_2009,0072, President I also would like to make a few comments on the issue that is pending before this body and which has been debated and debated and debated discussed and discussed and discussed It is time to bring it to a meaningful and final conclusion As I address this Chamber today we stand on the cusp of history For many years we have known that the American health care system is badly broken Now after nearly a century of debate after 100 years of delay and false starts this body is on the verge of laying the issue of health reform to a rest This bill represents the culmination of decades of hard work Its course has been shaped by 11 Presidents and countless Members of the House and Senate It has taken a long and winding path to reach this point This legislation is a product of compromise and consensus of give and take on both sides It is not perfect by no means is it perfect But here we stand We have come further than any Congress in history on this issue We have worked hard to craft a measure that can accomplish the goals of reform without alienating those whose support we need to pass this bill Without a commitment to certain ideals this bill would be empty and ineffective But without a willingness to work together and achieve compromise this bill can never become a political reality As responsible legislators this is the fine line we must always walk It is never easy I applaud my colleagues for the fine work they have done at every step along the way Still not everyone is satisfied so the work goes on It is the genius of our Founding Fathers and the rules of this body that allow one Senator to keep debate alive so we can work debate write rewrite legislation together One Senator can do that under the rules of this body Some have suggested that we kill this legislation and start over They suggest that we stop and come up with something new They say without perfection we should give up on reform altogether I have spoken on the Senate floor Mr President You know what my position has been But giving up on this issue is not an option So as my colleagues and I continue to move forward from here I would like to make one thing very clear After 100 years of debate we have come too far and worked too hard to turn back now Too many Americans are counting on us to make a decision on their behalf They need it now They dont need it tomorrow or next week or next month or next year or neverthey need it now Killing the bill would ignore those who look to us for help in their time of crisis We cannot abandon them at this time Leaving tens of millions of people without any health coverage at all is also unacceptable To all those who believe we should kill this bill I would say this I understand their frustration the impulse to say enough is enough But our vote in this body on this bill is not the end of a path for this sweeping legislation only a door to the next step of conference I have not yet seen the details of the legislation I have not yet seen the CBO score I have not yet seen the provisions that will earn my vote namely cost containment competition and accountability It is only through keeping this legislation alive that we can continue our work to make this a more perfect document I say we must continue to work on this document we have before us We cannot kill this legislation and start over We must keep working through this legislation keeping it alive so we can continuecontinueto make this document what we want it to be That is what we must do I yield the floor Mr President I suggest the absence of a quorum 
H_PA_DENT,2009-12-11,2005_2009; 2005_2009,0083; 0082, A recorded vote was ordered Speaker this motion to recommit will immediately end the Troubled Asset Relief Program otherwise known as TARP and require that all TARP funds that are repaid to the Treasuryincluding interest dividends the sale value of stock and the sale of warrants be used to reduce our national burgeoning deficits It will also reduce the debt limit by the same amount saved by ending TARP I call this motion to recommit the troubled taxpayer relief program act because it takes an important step towards getting government out of the bailout business and curbing excessive Washington spending TARP was originally enacted as a temporary plan to address an extraordinary crisis in our financial markets as a result of the collapse of financial firms that the government said were just too big to fail Those who voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act which created TARP did so with the assurance that the money would be returned to taxpayers That was the assurance given at the time It is unfortunate that the President chose to extend the TARP program to October 3 2010 In doing so he has opened the door to efforts by Democrats in Congress to begin spending unallocated and repaid TARP funds for programs unrelated to the financial emergency In fact the underlying bill diverts 4 billion from TARP to a number of foreclosure mitigation and neighborhood stabilization programs It also diverts a total of 23625 billion to pay for the massive expansion of government bureaucracy that will result from the enactment of this legislation And just yesterday we heard from Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner that the administration is developing an initiative to tackle our economic problems and unemployment by using TARP funds for small businesses Elizabeth Warren appointed to lead the panel that oversees the use of TARP funds responded to the Secretary saying Its not news to anyone that small business lending is important Small businesses are closing every day But Treasury has announced three plans and has not gotten the job done The President has said that we need to spend our way out of this recession The majority already tried that in passing the 787 billion stimulus It has not worked Now they want to spend more TARP money Havent we learned that if we want to create jobs and grow our economy we must support the private sector and invest Federal dollars sparingly and wisely Unfortunately this bill not only fails to end the TARP now that the emergency in the financial markets has abated it also turns TARP into a revolving slush fund to pay for the majoritys political economic and social agenda Failing to honor the original intent of TARP and repay the taxpayers is an irresponsible breach of trust that we are committed to stopping Americans are struggling under the weight of high unemployment sluggish economic growth and unsustainable Federal deficits This Congress has piled on with a socalled stimulus bill that borrows too much spends too much and delivers too few jobs and a budget that doubles the national debt in 5 years and triples it in 10 years They are piling on with a misguided national energy tax called capandtrade that will cost thousands of jobs in my State of Pennsylvania and increase energy costs for families and businesses alike an undemocratic card check bill that will deny secret ballots and impose binding arbitration and a controversial health care bill that imperils innovation raises taxes cuts Medicare and endangers jobs Now they are piling on with this 1300page bill that keeps taxpayers on the hook for permanent bailouts allows unelected bureaucrats to pick winners and losers in our economy and adds an array of new job killing taxes and mandates on consumers investors and small businesses Raiding TARP to fund more government programs that dont create jobs verges on the reckless The best way to bring about economic growth and job creation is to avoid the massive deficits and to lessen the massive increase in the national debt These misguided policies advanced by the majority are a road to higher inflation and record tax increases Today we can begin the process of putting our fiscal house in order and inspiring confidence in the private sector by shutting down TARP returning the unused funds to the taxpayers and lowering the national debt limit At this time I would like to yield the balance of my time to Mr Hensarling of Texas

students on the fourthgrade reading tests and about the failures of students on the eighthgrade math tests so I am really interested in your description of how the TRIO Programs really provide an intervention as it were in admittedly a systemically failed process up through middle school The TRIO Programs as I have come to understand them literally intervene in kids lives in middle schools through the Upper Bound program for example and through Talent Search They really identify that next generation of students who have the capability and the capacity to go to college and to really keep our country on top Many countries do this They have done it for generations They have identified kids in middle schools Despite the incapacity of the families based on their incomes to put their kids in private schools or to give them tutoring the TRIO Programs intervene in middle school and put them on a college track Here are some of the data and statistics that I want you to respond to First of all in terms of lowincome studentsand Im not talking about any particular race or anything because as I understand it 37 percent of those students enrolled in TRIO are white students 35 percent are African American 19 percent are Hispanic 4 percent are Native Americans 22000 of these students in TRIO are disabled students and 25000 are veterans So here we have a really diverse group of students who take advantage of these TRIO Programs but they have one thing in commonthey are all lowincome students They are all students who are disadvantaged by not having wealthy parents who can send them to prep schools These are students we are depending on to become that next generation of engineers scientists and biologists They are the people who are going to correct the conditions of our lakes of our forests and who will be these innovators Yet of all the lowincome students in our country only 41 percent enroll in college and after 6 years in these Student Support Services we find that almost 31 percent of these students actually attain a bachelors degree and that only 21 percent literally 10 percent fewer of them graduate from college when you have only given them Pell Grants I guess that is one of the problems that you have tried to share with us today which is If you are going to spend 27 billion and are going to make that kind of important investment in financial aid it sure is important to give these students the wraparound services that they need perhaps some remediation in math and in reading so that they can succeed some support services If you will indulge me Mr Scott I will tell you a little story I was pregnant at 18 years old when I graduated from high school and I was not headed to college As a matter of fact I was at the then Boys Clubit was not the Boys and Girls Club I was at the Boys Club watching the boys play basketball when a young man walked up to me and said The director of the Educational Opportunity Program in Marquette is looking for you and he said he wants you to come down there right away Thats how I ended up in college18 years old pregnant What these programs do is they actually interrupt the poverty cycle They actually interrupted the sociological outcome for me to just be a welfare mom receiving food stamps with no hope of ever making an important contribution to society So I think that if we are looking at a longterm bang for our buck these TRIO Programs and increasing the funding for these TRIO Programs will certainly do that because we cannot afford the downward slide that you have described Im not sure that people have really understood the seriousness of this You mentioned that we were probably in the middle of the pack According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development we are about 15th among 29 industrialized countries in college completion rates That really has consequences because when you look at China and at Japan and at South Korea these are countries that are now the innovators in the world They are producing the engineers There used to be a time when you saw Chinese students sitting in American universities You dont really see that anymore They are staying at home and are obtaining their baccalaureate degrees Now President Obama has indicated that he has a goal of producing the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020 To reach that goal this Pell Grant increase is a part of that program He also wants to expand the reach of community colleges wants to invest Federal money in research and data collection and in other reforms to the student loan program and wants to simplify the student aid process The gentleman from Virginia those are very good intentions and youre experienced on the Education and Labor Committee but I guess Id like you to respond to whether or not just simply providing financial aid and collecting data will get us there Reclaiming my time I guess what Im recalling is a country where I mean we invented the telephone We invented the automobile the television the camera Google iPod Weve made major medical breakthroughs We discovered the cure We discovered Penicillin and practically eradicated polio by developing the vaccine And weve done this because we have been number one in the world for developing a brain trust So I guess Im sort of curious about the statements that youve just made that we no longer have the smartest students or the best workforce and that were no longer leading in innovation and technology I was just looking at an article that was published in Forbes Magazine recently called Investing in Americas Future and one of the points that the author made was that in California twofifths of the States jobs are expected to require college degrees by the year 2020 But the number of adults with those credentials will fall short So its not just a matter of providing an opportunity for middleclass and upperclass students Weve been joined by Congresswoman Sheila JacksonLee who has spoken often about the need for businesses to have an educated workforce Ive heard her speak very passionately about how there are so many requests among our business leaders for foreign students to come into the country because we dont have an educated workforce And so gentleman Id like you to respond to that Madam Speaker I am concerned about Irans irresponsible violations both of its commitments under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty NPT and its agreements which it signed with the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA I share my colleagues conviction to stop an Iranian regime headed by Ahmadinejad from getting nuclear weapons However I think we should do so without crippling the Iranian people as is noted in this legislation towards whom the people of the United States have feelings of friendship and hold in the highest esteem or crippling efforts to raise a unified and international response to Irans continuing noncompliance While we all recognize that the intention of this act is not to punish the Iranian people it does not escape me that the impact of these sanctions will result in more suffering for them nonetheless Upon introducing this bill in April the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee noted his belief that this measure could have a powerfully negative impact on the Iranian economy For sanctions to be truly crippling to Iran they have to cripple the people first At a time when the Iranian people have courageously challenged the mullahs and the rulers in Iran by taking to the streets after the elections and recently again this month there is concern that this unilateral approach may end up benefitting not hindering the regime and sowing the anger of the Iranian people at the US not the Iranian government Unilateral sanctions can have unintended consequences In a recent Dear Colleague it was noted that in two recent instances Microsoft and Google each determined that they must deny instant messaging services to the Iranian people that were previously available citing their duty to comply with US sanctions Apparently this medium had become a popular way for protesters to get around increasing efforts by the Iranian government to monitor their communications As a result my colleagues warned that Congress must act quickly to ensure that we are not unwittingly doing the repressive work of the Iranian government on its behalf The President is currently working with our international partners not only as part of a renewed diplomatic outreach effort but also to fashion a strong multilateral response if Iran continues to refuse to cooperate with the international community In testimony in October the State Department told Congress that it believes it has the authorities necessary to take strong action alone and together with our international partners should they prove necessary to squeeze off financing of Irans nuclear weapons efforts For example the Treasury Department can continue to use the authority that it has used for over three years now to blacklist Iranian banks and encourage international banks to avoid doing business with Iran As a result since 2006 the US has taken action against over 100 banks government entities companies and people involved in Irans support for terrorism and its proliferation activities including freezing assets and preventing US persons wherever located from doing business with them Recently the Department wrote to express its concerns about companion Senate legislation to the bill before us today warning that during this crucial period of intense diplomacy to impose significant international pressure on Iran it was concerned that such legislation in its current form might weaken rather than strengthen international unity and support for these efforts In this letter the Administration appealed for a delay of that bill in order not to undermine its diplomacy at this critical juncture Israeli officials have also made clear that broadbased international efforts including for sanctions are better than the unilateral approach before us today Very recently Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak noted that There is a need for tough sanctions Something that is well and coherently coordinated to include the Americans the EU the Chinese the Russians the Indians I also share the concerns that some have that the legislation before the House today will disempowernot empowerthe President to bring this multination coalition together by taking away or limiting his flexibility to use sanctions as necessary to assist diplomatic efforts Thats a very curious definition of empowerment Its as curious as saying that it is in the US national security interest and helps diplomacy to make it harder for the Presidentany Presidentto use and waive sanctions when he thinks the timing best serves our efforts to put pressure on Iran The Presidents flexibility to conduct foreign relations and diplomatic efforts to achieve a strong international consensus against Iran is not a loophole that needs to be closed but a vital tool that needs to be supported I am concerned that this bill as written would keep our allies from working with us to address the threat from Iran Earlier this year Nicholas Burns who served under the Administrations of George HW Bush Bill Clinton and as George W Bushs top State Department negotiator in efforts to thwart Irans nuclear program testified in dealing with Iran My main recommendation for this committee and the Congress however is to permit the President maximum flexibility and maneuverability as he deals with an extraordinarily difficult and complex situation in Iran and in discussions with the international group of countries considering sanctions It would be unwise to tie the Presidents hands in legislation when it is impossible to know how the situation will develop in the coming months An action taken against Iranincluding sanctionsshould have the broadest possible support in the international community According to the Administration with wide international support sanctions regimes can be enforced pressure can be sustained and Irans leaders are less able to shift the blame from themselves to the US for the pains caused by their behavior Even the Senate version of this same legislation recognizes the limits of more US only sanctions In section 111 of S 2799 it is noted that in general multilateral sanctions are more effective than unilateral sanctions at achieving desired results from countries such as Iran International pressure for Iran to act or to face more forceful international action is building as evidenced by the recent IAEA vote condemning Iran for its Qom enrichment facilities All five vetowielding members of the Security Council China and Russia included voted for that measure which opens up the potential for another round of Security Council sanctions The progress in uniting the Security Council is attributable to President Obamas investment in diplomacy If Congress moves forward with sanctions that target our allies that unity may very well collapse Sanctions have a place I am a cosponsor of HR 1327 the Iran Enabling Sanctions Act of 2009 which passed the House with my support by a vote of 4146 on October 29th There are even provisions of this legislation which are worthwhile and which I have supported in the past as standalone legislation HR 957 in the 110th Congress that make clear that current US sanctions can be used against financial institutions insurers underwriters guarantors and any other business organizations including foreign subsidiaries that aid investment in Irans energy sector However the less united the international community is in applying pressure against Iran the greater the risk our measures will not have the impact we seek And given the gravity of the stakes at risk here that would be truly regrettable As noted by Secretary of State Clinton just yesterday we have pursued under President Obamas direction a dualtrack approach to Iran We have reached out We have offered the opportunity to engage in meaningful serious discussions with our Iranian counterparts The second track of our dualtrack strategy is to bring the international community together to stand in a united front against the Iranians I hope that as this legislation moves forward in the legislative process further changes will be made to strengthen this bill in a way that will truly enhance and not hobble strong diplomatic efforts to diplomatically engage with Iran as well as to enact multilateral sanctions This administration has been very good on financial aid and this Congress has been great in providing financial aid As a matter of fact between fiscal years 2001 and 2009 the Pell Grant has seen an increase of over 27 billion Now these TRIO Programs that you talk about have a funding level of 853 million That is less than 1 billion to the Pell Grant of 27 billion While providing financial aid to students is a great strategy can you tell me why you think it is so important to fund these TRIO Programs in addition to the Pell Grant Arent we making a big enough investment in Pell Will the gentleman yield Speaker its such a privilege to stand in the well of the House of Representatives Each time I stand here I just shiver and shake and think about just how I got here and the unusual circumstances that have allowed me to be here Really coming from a very poor background parents who had very very meager means But it was because of an educational opportunity that Im able to be here with you and to speak with you here this evening Youve heard it all from the well of the House of Representatives Mr Speaker Youve heard about all of the problems that we have in our economy And this evening I want to talk to you about the importance of reestablishing ourselves in the world as a nation that is graduating students from college and producing the next generation of innovators and engineers and doctors and scientists and teachers so that we can reestablish ourselves in the world and continue to enable our economy to grow But of course youve heard about all of the problems that sort of crowd out a really important discussion about the importance of funding educational opportunity Youve heard about the two wars and the escalation which is going to cost us 30 billion Youve heard about the war spending Between 2001 until 2009 weve spent just under 950 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan and weve just included another 139 billion for both wars In July the DOD was spending 11 billion a month on both wars And CRS projects that were going to be spending another 400 billion to 900 billion in the next 10 years Youve heard about the entitlement programs Medicare and Social Security and how theyre in danger and how we have to fund that Youve heard about the escalating health care costs consuming 20 cents of every consumer dollar in the socalled takeover by the government of health care Youve heard about the great recession where as many as 700000 jobs were lost in a single month in the last 15 months Youve heard about the financial systemic risk that threatens the economy not only of the United States of America but of the world requiring countries including this one to develop billions of dollars in stimulus funding Youve heard about various proposals to right ourselves and to justify our economy Youve heard proposals to just simply reduce spending Youve heard proposals to give tax breaks to the wealthy and that these tax breaks will somehow trickle down to support those workers and small businesses And youve even heard whispers of raising taxes And very few people raise as a solution to this problem at looking hard at what were doing in terms of advancing postsecondary educational opportunity Thats why this evening Mr Speaker Im so happy to be joined by my dear friend and colleague from Virginia Representative Bobby Scott who serves on the Labor and Education Committee and Im sure will give us some valuable information about the importance of preparing the next generation of students Will the gentleman yield please Will the gentleman yield Gentleman you indicated I heard you say that we need to get all of our kids prepared to go to college And Im wondering if we arent concerned about class warfare We talked about those parents who are not low income Theyve gone to college Theyve had a college fund for their children early on And perhaps these are parents who might feel somewhat resentful that theres a program out there that provides supportive services for lowincome students as I indicated I mean 41 percent of lowincome students justI mean if youre not an athlete and you can win a scholarship you know if youre not summa cum laude valedictorian of your high school you might not have access to scholarship funds What would you say to those parents who do have a baccalaureate degree about the need to make sure we give access to all students to college Im so happy this evening that weve been joined by Congresswoman Sheila JacksonLee from Houston Texas and I would yield to her at this time Ms JACKSONLEE of Texas Let me thank the distinguished gentlelady from the great State of Wisconsin for her persistence in the work that I found her doing when I visited her district some several years ago She has been persistent and consistent and Im delighted to join her this evening along with my friend and colleague from Virginia I served with Bobby Scott as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime But he has redefined that committee and he realizes with his experience on the Education and Labor Committee that we are going down the wrong direction And I combine the idea of steering people away from a life of crime or the mistakes that weve made in the criminal justice system with the poor response that we have given to our education system I really think that we have or we took our education system for granted It was there We were at a point in our lives in the 19th century the 20th century most particularly when we were really churning in the economy and we were at the cutting edge of invention We had televisions we were doing transistor radios we did the telephone We were really if you will at the peak of the envy of all the world and we took for granted that individuals would start school public school by the way and they would finish school and some would finish high school but they would still be at an economic level that they could provide for their families And others went to college And so Im listening to this discussion about our international competitiveness and I read this sentence to you America no longer has the smartest students or the smartest workforce in the world I would take issue with that and say that we have the smart people but we have not cultivated them and provided them the support system that a TRIO provides a steering Its almost as if you had a playing field and you told people to just get out on that playing field There were no guidelines there were no bases to make there were no touchdowns to make and what would you get Youd have very poor results But if you had some guidelines if you told them that they had to go from one point to the next that they had to kick the ball into the field goal area or they had to make a touchdown or they to had hit a home run And thats why Ive come to the floor today because I want to share these statistics but I want to refute these statistics and I want to say its time now to go back to the old to reinvest in our education as if we cared about it And so let me cite these numbers that may have already been put into the Record but I believe its important that show the 2007 trends in international mathematics and science study which is really a baby of mine Ive been on or served on the Science Committee for 12 years In that my emphasis was math and science and NASA and what NASA can do to inspire our young people to want to be scientists and mathematicians It measures the math and science knowledge of fourth and eighth graders Our students dont perform like those in competitor nations Only 10 percent of US fourth graders and 6 percent of US eighth graders scored at or above the international average in math That means that 94 percent of our eighth graders are getting beat by countries like Singapore Hong Kong England and Russia and Kazakhstani students scored better in math than our own fourth graders What does that mean It means that there is a legitimate argument for TRIO because TRIO provides the kind of road map that gives you the support systems that really cause students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds to get to the finish line to be able to kick the goal to make the touchdown to make the home run And I believe that weve been lax in the funding Its always easy to cut funding for the vulnerable We dont have to worry about any funding for the vulnerable because their voices cannot be heard We know that just across the country the University of either Southern California or Berkley has students who have been picketing and sitting in for weeks because of tuition increases So we know how disadvantaged students are more disadvantaged as they raise tuition costs and they dont have support systems So for example here is what TRIO has done college going rates for TRIO versus nonTRIO students All lowincome students 41 percent enrolled in college Upward Bound participants 773 percent Upward Bound MathScience 865 percent and Talent Search 79 percent What is there to convince that TRIO works that the support system works Student Support Services lowincome bachelor degree attainment with a 6year period Student Support Services 309 percent receive Pell but no support 21 percent way down receive neither Pell nor support 89 percent They just dont make it Will the gentlelady yield Ms JACKSONLEE of Texas Ill be happy to yield This is the question I have for my colleagues here If its so clear as youve indicated gentlelady from Texas that TRIO works if its so clear as the gentleman from Virginia has indicated that we need in order to remain globally competitive and to continue to be the innovative country and to really develop a way to develop and create new revenues for our country were not going to just cut spending and raise taxes and have that be adequate for remaining a firstclass nation If its true that we dont have enough upperclass students who are graduating from college that we can afford to ignore lowincome white students lowincome African American students lowincome Hispanic students lowincome Asian students disabled students and veterans who are in these programs if we cant afford to ignore them weve got to grab them and educate them so that we can meet those goals and that bar why has TRIO been flat funded What are the consequences of the fact that TRIO was flat funded during fiscal year 2006 and 2008 had just a minimal increase in 2009 a minimal increase in 2010 and God bless him our Appropriations Chair Dave Obey added 20 million to TRIO this cycle but after all of the negotiations with the Senate only 5 million was retained in that program What are the consequences of reducing these vital services to TRIO students and our remaining competitiveness of the world We need at least 200 million for this program Ms JACKSONLEE of Texas You are eloquent in crafting the frustration that you experience and so many of us experience And do you know what the answer is They just dont get it Not the friends and allies who work so hard the chairman of the Appropriations Committee on the House side so many Members who understand what TRIO means but the overall thinkers about education and how to cut dollars just dont get it TRIO costs an average of about 1000 per student per year 1000 Pell is estimated to spend approximately 25 billion helping over 7 million students get aid The combination of a TRIO effort for a student counters the tragedy and let me just retract that word and not utilize tragedy but when you look at it and you say we are the country that spent the 20th century just inventing about everything the world now uses when we think of China we are glad that it has made gigantic steps of development It still is a developing nation and a lot of what China has made its economic rise on has been what we invented in the 20th century and now they make it in a cheaper manner So what we are losing is we are losing the genius of our invention and inventiveness H1B is what youre talking about The H1B visas have become the popular response So Im not going to worry about the fact that our children dont know math and science Forget about it Well just import thousands upon thousands I have no quarrel with them We just stood today and introduced a comprehensive immigration reform bill There is no quarrel with the idea that this Nation is a nation of laws and immigrants but there is a quarrel when we throw to the side those disabled those veterans those disadvantaged students those children who have a single parent who would not have the ability to be able to follow through on college So what do we lose Again we lose the ability to invent for the next generation We lose the scientific minds that are going to be at the cutting edge of finding the right kind of cure for HIVAIDS or stopping the H1N1 pandemic or finding a cure for cancer or being able to fix crumbling bridges This is what we lose And frankly I believe we are long overdue for the reckoning that comes with the idea that we are ignoring our children I would like to just use as an example the fact what we call AP classes and advanced classes You poll and find out how many of those classes are still being kept advanced placement Its all about budget We dont respect or appreciate how much money good education can generate and I think that we lose our rightful competitive place in the world And I would much rather invest 1000 in TRIO than 1000 in making war and taking a chance of losing one of our bright young men or bright young women who has gone on the front lines We appreciate them But what Im saying is we should give equal opportunity for those who are either after their military service or in the midst of their military service or that want to go to school we should give them the opportunity to do so and that is what TRIO is all about Will the gentlelady yield Ms JACKSONLEE of Texas Id be happy to yield My colleague Representative Scott is a great mentor of mine He serves on the Budget Committee and he is an expert on one of the subjects that really consumes a great deal of time on this floor and in our committees and thats the subject of the budget deficit and how we dig ourselves out of this hole And I guess I was wondering if he would shareIm sort of surprising him with this question but I guess I would like for him to talk about the revenue options or the cutting options or how we got into this fiscal hole that we are in and what the role of educating and having an educated workforce will have on us ever being able to approach some sort of deficit reduction And I will yield to the gentleman That is so important You know the Department of Education really bears this out They say a high school dropout earns about 18000 a yearof course thats if theyre not costing us money in the prison systema high school graduate 26000 a year an associates degree 38000 and a bachelors degree 65000 When we consider our aging baby boomers we certainly are going to need to make sure that we have a lot of higher income individuals working toward all of these innovations that we are so capable of Before I yield to the gentlelady I just want to say that old adage pennywise and pound foolish I started this hour out by talking about all of the competing problems that we discuss on this floor the cost of the war and cost of health care costs of Medicare and Social Security those entitlement programs the cost of escalating the war in Afghanistan the great recession where at its height 700000 jobs were lost in a single month the bailout funds for the too big to fail institutions And so if we allow ourselves to get mired down in this and decide that 200 million for an education program is just too much money that would be the perfect place to talk about pennywise and pound foolish wouldnt you agree gentleman That was just amazing information The gentlelady from Texas I would love to hear what you have to say on this matter Ms JACKSONLEE of Texas Well I think this discussion should be a roadmap but it also should be a primer a tutorial for us not heading toward the disaster that we are heading toward We should heed some of the comments that have been made I would like to build on this issue of the criminal justice system which has just grown exponentially I would say to the gentlelady that there are at least 1 million persons in our prison system throughout the Nation It is known to be the largest prison system in the civilized world It is called the prison industrial complex because there is so much money spent in incarcerating persons and it does not seem that we have gotten it again to invest on the front end So I would just like to share with you according to the National Center for Education Statistics which studies the math skills of 15 yearolds throughout several industrialized countries our United States students ranked 25th internationally Why Probably not embraced by the TRIO concept the support system concept High school graduates only 75 percent I realize that TRIO goes forward into the college area but it means that these students are not getting support early High school graduation only 75 percent of firstyear high school students graduate within 4 years 25 percent of our students are left behind Today 1 in 10 24yearolds still lack a high school degree According to the Alliance for Excellent Education 76 percent of white students graduate in a 4year period compared with 55 percent of Hispanic students and 51 percent of African American students There lies the crux of the need for TRIO because we need that kind of inspiration Let me just finish The Alliance estimates that high school dropouts from the class of 2008listen to this numberwill cost the United States 319 billion in lost wages over their lifetime Is there any defense for not supporting TRIO for not funding it to the max so that we can draw these students through the high school period into the college and then see them graduate and invest that 319 billion into the economic engine of this economy and on the other side having skills that are marketable skills I started out by saying that we have been cited as not having the smartest students in this century or this time frame I said no these are smart students we just have not given them the rules we have not laid out the plan we have not directed them we have not provided them the TRIO support system that can be so helpful in providing the kind of economic engine for America So in this climate of high unemployment and all of this talk about creating jobs we cannot ignore Americas education system for our children Thank you so much gentlelady from Houston Texas And thank you my dear friend and colleague on the Budget Committee and also on the Education and Labor Committee Before we close out this hour I just want to sort of summarize what we have said here this evening We really admire this Congress and our President for really revamping tuition and making adequate tuition a priority It has been so important to revisit how we make student loans so that we dont just provide funding for bankers that we actually use those funds for students to simplify student forms It is even important to invest in research about educational outcomes It has been very very important to have seen the dramatic increase in the Pell Grant because without this tuition assistance students would not be able to make it Tuition assistance is a vital component in helping lowincome and firstgeneration college students or any students get through college Without these dollars higher education would be unattainable for millions of students who rely on Pell to pay the bills But all too often Pell is a wasted investment for our low income kids because they dont have access to guidance counselors and tutors and the other types of support that come with the TRIO programs It doesnt do the student or our country much good if we spend millions on firstyear Pell recipients only to have those students drop out after their second or third year Thats not a sound investment A sound investment is making sure that when we commit to providing educational resources for our most vulnerable kids we give them all the tools to successfully see that journey through Thats why were here today This Congress has drastically increased vital funding for Pell Grants I have been and will continue to be a staunch supporter of that increased investment but I also know that millions of those dollars will be wasted unless we also invest in the tools to get these students through college More importantly our country our country our beloved country that we love so much and love so dearly and a country that has given us an amazing lifestyle of modern living is at risk if we dont educate the future workforce We have got to start with our tiny tots in early education but thats a more longterm goal Right now we are having an emergency an emergency students are either not graduating from high school or they are graduating with deficiencies In order to step up we need a TRIO program a modest amount of funding 200 million in the scheme of things nothing like we are spending on all the other crises in this country that would help these programs serve those students who are on waiting lists With that I would yield to the gentleman from Virginia This has been great this has been fantastic and I would say that the importance of this program is its diversity It is not a program that just benefits one group of people Thirty seven percent of TRIO students are white 35 percent are African Americans 19 percent are Hispanics 4 percent are Native Americans 22000 of TRIOs students are disabled students and 25000 are our beloved veterans This is a program that embraces every American from all backgrounds and makes sure that money is not the reason that you cannot use your brain Talk about a brain drain its a brain drain when the only thing that stands between you and greatness is an education Thank you so much and good night

colloquy managed by Senator MCCain So Republican Senators are free to engage in discussion President during the next 55 minutes we will have several Republican Senators come to the floor I ask unanimous consent that during that time Senator MCCain be allowed to be the manager of a colloquy among the Republican Senators The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Without objection it is so ordered President before Senator MCCain begins if I may I wish to take a moment to establish where we are today and what happened yesterday as a leadin to what he is about to discuss Yesterday Senator MCCain offered an amendment on the floor of the Senate that would do two things It would send this 2074page Democratic health care bill back to the Finance Committee and say to them No 1 take out the cuts in Medicare and No 2 any savings in Medicare must go to make Medicare more solvent That is what the MCCain amendment would have accomplished That was defeated Fiftyeight Democrats said yes to the cuts in Medicare They said yes to using the money that comes from these cuts to create a new entitlement program Forty Republicans and two Democrats said no we dont want cuts to Medicare and we do not want a new entitlement program So yesterday we made it clear that the central core of this bill includes nearly 12 trillion in cuts to Medicare There is no question about that Everyone concedes that The President said that when he addressed us The Congressional Budget Office says that The question is whether it is a good idea or a bad idea and yesterday by 58 votes the Democrats said yes to these cuts in Medicare Today we want to talk about one aspect of those cuts which is Medicare Advantage We are going to talk about these cuts in a careful accurate way so the 11 million seniors who have Medicare Advantage understand exactly what the risk is to their Medicare Advantage policies We can see that a portion of the overall Medicare cuts that the Democrats approved yesterday is a 120 billion cut over the next 10 years to the Medicare Advantage program Now what is Medicare Advantage Medicare Advantage is an option seniors have If you choose this option Medicare pays a fixed amount every year for your care to companies that might come to you and offer a Medicare Advantage plan which you can choose instead of the original Medicare plan Many seniors choose these plans11 million seniors Nearly one out of four seniors in America who are part of Medicare chooses the Medicare Advantage plan In my home State of Tennessee the number is about 230000 Tennesseans Why do they choose it Well it includes some benefits they may not have in the original Medicare plan These benefits include dental care vision care hearing coverage reduced hospital deductibles lower co payments lower premiums coordinated chronic care management and physical fitness programs The distinguished Senator from Oregon was on the floor and he mentioned grandma I have mentioned grandma a few timesno disrespect to grandpa he is in the same boat He said grandma didnt need to worry about her Medicare Advantage plan because none of the benefits would be cut That is not what the Director of the CBO who is often cited by the chairman of the Finance Committee has said He said that half of the benefits currently provided to seniors under Medicare Advantage would disappear under the Finance Committee plan which is much like the plan we are considering The benefits that would disappear would include those I mentioned Today with Senator MCCain leading the discussion we wish to talk about the Medicare Advantage plan and why cuts to Medicare Advantage play a central part of this 25 trillion bill Cuts to Medicare pay for about half of that 25 trillion cost and the ones we are talking about today are the Medicare Advantage plans I understand there will be an amendment by Senator Hatch who has joined us and I am sure he will talk about his own amendment He was present on the Finance Committee when Medicare Advantage was created I understand there will be an amendment to send this back to the Finance Committee saying dont cut Medicare Advantage If the Senator from Pennsylvania Senator Casey said that he is merely repeating what the Director of the CBO stated when he said that fully half of the benefits of Medicare Advantage will be lost To answer the Senators question Medicare Advantage is an option that 11 million of the 40 million seniors who are on Medicare have chosen The reason they choose it is because it is a plan offered by private companies often to people in rural areas often to minorities They often choose it because the plans generally offer these benefits dental care vision care hearing coverage reduced hospital deductibles lower copayments lower premiums coordinated chronic care management and physical fitness programs President I see the Senator from Texas the Senator from Idaho and the Senator from Wyoming have all come to the floor in addition to the sponsor of the motion Senator Hatch I am sure they are prepared to reflect on who is hurt by these cuts The only thing I would emphasize is what the Senator from Arizona has said is that disproportionately lowincome Americans in Texas Idaho Tennessee Wyoming and Utah are hurt Only onethird of eligible White seniors who do not have Medicaid or employerbased insurance are enrolled in Medicare Advantage But the number increases to 40 percent for African Americans and 53 percent for Hispanics That it is the reason 11 million Americans choose Medicare Advantage because these benefits are not available under the original Medicare plan I wonder if I might ask the Senator from Idaho to go back over a point he made a moment ago because he went over it quickly and it is such an important point and one reflected by the chart behind him about what he just said Repeatedly we are told that seniors wont lose benefits if you cut nearly 12 trillion in Medicare So if you could take a momentI believe you were in the Finance Committee markup where the bill was being written that was offered by the distinguished Finance Committee chairman and I believe you were talking to the head of the Congressional Budget Office who is often cited by our friends on the other side as the nonpartisan authority for exactly what the bill does and you asked him whether the benefits of Medicare Advantage recipients would be cut Would you describe that in a little more detail so people understand exactly the scenario I would direct my comment to the Senator from New Hampshire too The President of the United States said something a few weeks ago that I thought was profound and that I agreed with he said this debate is not just about health care it is about the role of the Federal Government in the everyday lives of the American people I believe he is exactly right about that which is why so many Americans are turning against this bill Would the Senator from New Hampshire agree the President was correct that this debate is about in my words now Washington takeovers more taxes more spending and more debt It is not just about health care The enormous interest across the country in these votes comes from a much larger picture than this health care bill

yielding time Madam Speaker the Department of Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2010 is intended to provide equipment and technology for our troops Our countrys greatest treasure lies in the bravery in the dedication and in the ability of or servicemen and women These courageous individuals protect our freedoms every day We thank them and we thank their families for their support dedication and sacrifice This bill provides topoftheline medical care for our troops including funding for traumatic brain injury and psychological health This bill provides funding for wounded ill and injured servicemembers as well as for cancer research This bill provides our military with a pay increase and it continues efforts to end the practice of stop losscompensating troops for every month their terms of service will be involuntarily extended in 2010 This bill includes funding to provide support for our countrys military families who sacrifice every day on behalf of our Nation and to whom we owe a great debt This bill provides our troops with firstclass military equipment and readiness training ensuring they are fully prepared to successfully perform their missions However while this bill contains funding for several important and necessary initiatives I would be remiss if I did not mention my disappointment in the overall funding levels when compared to the increases we have seen throughout the appropriations season this year While the bill does receive roughly a 45 percent increase over last year this increase is not comparable to nondefense appropriations bills we have voted on this year which average a 12 percent increase in funding levels As we have noted before the Federal Government is the only unit of government to provide for our national security These represent the wrong priorities of the Democrats who are in charge of the Congress and of the Obama administration Increasing spending for domestic priorities by double digits while in comparison shortchanging national defense represents a dangerous wrongheaded policy that does not rightly prioritize the security of our Nation Thus while I am pleased that several items in this bill are being funded in order to provide our troops with the tools training and medical services they need and deserve I am disappointed that after increasing the funding levels for domestic appropriations bills by an average of 12 percent the Democrats in control decided only to increase our defense spending by 45 percentless than halffor the coming year This is the last appropriations bill and that is because it has been held in order for the majority to put into it things that are not related which I will be discussing a bit more but the substance of the DOD appropriations bill is not the source of my concern The extent of the closed rule before us today allows for the consideration of a variety of additional legislation that has been cobbled together without committee consideration As my colleagues have said before our colleagues across the aisle have gone to great lengths to shut down debate Therefore I urge my colleagues to vote no on the rule so the bill can be returned to the committee and can be brought back under regular order Madam Speaker I reserve the balance of my time Madam Speaker I would now like to yield 3 minutes to my very distinguished colleague from Texas one of only five CPAs in the House Mr Conaway Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California I am happy to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado Madam Speaker as we approach the Christmastime too many Americans are asking Where are the jobs In January the unemployment rate was 76 percent Only 10 months later the national unemployment reached a whopping 102 percent the highest level since April 1983 That means today there are 157 million unemployed Americans looking for work House Republicans have an economic recovery plan that will help get Americans back to work Our economic recovery plan will create twice the jobs at half the cost of the Democrats failed stimulus plan How ironic that our colleagues are coming to the floor today to talk about the need for jobs when it is their votes and the policies of this President that have killed so many jobs Its time we started working on behalf of the American people and focus on real commonsense solutions that will help put people get back to work and let them celebrate Christmas in a wonderful way Madam Speaker I appreciate my colleague yielding the time this morning I want to say that it seems every time we come here we have to do a little bit of correcting peoples memory and their recollection of history My colleague just said when they took over the majority we had a 13 trillion deficit I think if she will check her facts she will see that the 13 trillion deficit came about as a result of the Democrats taking over the majority She may not have been here in 2007 but when they took over the majority I believe that the deficit was 259 billion and they made it 13 trillion this year with their Democratic President We are here considering a sameday martial law rule Now I understand that there are times when we need to move quickly when we are faced with an immediate crisis However I think the word crisis has been overused particularly this year We havent had much by way of crisis this year and yet theyre trying to make it a crisis by bringing in this again sameday martial law rule The Rules Committee met last night at 845 We didnt get the text of the bills that were going to be debating and the rule that were going to approve again in a few minutes or a little while so weve had very little time to be able to deal with these things But weve known about this for a long long time Weve known that the funding for the government would run out Friday night for over a month So what have we been doing during that period of time when we should have been preparing for this day Let me give some ideas on what weve been doing by reading out some of the bills that weve been voting on on the floor expressing support for designation of November 29 2009 as Drive Safer Sunday surely something that the country could not live without without our voting on it expressing support for designation of the week beginning on November 9 2009 as National School Psychology Week another extraordinarily important issue for us to be dealing with recognizing the 60th anniversary of the Berlin Airlifts success Certainly I am extremely proud of the fact that Ronald Reagan helped end the Cold War by opening up Berlin But I dont think that really needed to be done by a vote on this floor And then the one that I really think tops the cake and will get the attention of the American people honoring the 2560th anniversary of the birth of Confucius and recognizing his invaluable contributions to philosophy and social and political thought The fact that 2560 years have passed since the birth of Confucius and we hadnt acknowledged it I really think that could have waited a little bit longer in terms of the importance of the work that we are doing So here we are again doing what our colleagues across the aisle have been so good at this session shortcircuiting the legislative process so we can jam through another major spending bill without the benefit of Members or more importantly the citizens of this country having the opportunity to read it This rule enables us to take up the next rule and that rule will let the House consider more than 1 trillion in spending all done almost in the blink of an eye if you put it in the context of the birth of Confucius But let us not be fooled by this attempt to say that something is a crisis The reason we are doing this on the spur of the moment is because our Speaker and several Members are going to leave today to go to Copenhagen to talk with people about climate control And theyre going to emit much much carbon on their way to do that which really is sort of hypocritical in terms of what the conference is all about So we have folks talking out of both sides of their mouths here over and over and over again Madam Speaker I reserve the balance of my time Madam Speaker I now yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from California and ranking member of the Rules Committee Mr Dreier Mr DREIER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks Madam Speaker I find it very interesting that my colleague from Maine says we find ourselves here at the end of the Bush administration We have been in the Obama administration for a year yet our colleagues across the aisle cannot stop hearkening back to President Bush and blaming him for everything that has happened in this country in the last year when President Bush hasnt been in office and while the Republicans have not been in control The Democrats are in control They have been in control of the Congress for 3 years They actually inherited from President Bush and from the Republican controlled Congress a very excellent economy55 straight months of job growth In the first month that the Democrats took over the Congress the economy started going downhill and we can document that very very easily It isnt the Bush administration that deserves the blame for the ills of the economy its the Democratcontrolled Congress which began in January of 2007 which is when the economy started going sour I want to go back to the issue at hand which is Why do we have closed rules Why do we have a sameday martial law rule Why isnt there time for us to debate the important issues that the American people want us to be debating Why is it as my colleague from California has pointed out that our most important function that being the defense of this Nation and the appropriations for that part of the country which can be done by no other group of people in this country as the States cant do it and the locals cant do itis left to be done on a day when everybody is trying to get out for Christmas and we are doing it in a rush The Members arent allowed to read the bill The 72hour rule has gone out the window Nobody is allowed to read the bill because there is not enough time to do it We have been operating as my colleague said under closed rules with bills with no amendments while we are doing things like recognizing the Grand Concourse on its 100th anniversary as the preeminent thoroughfare in the borough of the Bronx and as an important nexus of commerce and culture for the City of New York That is how our colleagues want to spend their time which is by dealing with issues that are not a part of our critical job here in the House of Representatives by dealing with things that could have been done on a voice vote but we have to have no amendments allowed and no debate time because there isnt time to do these things according to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and this is what we are doing Madam Speaker I had an opportunity this week to once more visit Arlington National Cemetery It is always a sobering thing to do I went particularly to the active duty section this time where men and women who are currently serving our country have lost their lives It gets ones attention There were parents and relatives there grieving who had recently lost loved ones I visited the eternal flame of John Kennedy I dont have to be reminded of his comments in his inaugural speech Ask not what your country can do for you Ask what you can do for your country We are in a totally different time as my colleague has said We are in a time where we have people representing this country who want wealth redistribution They want to take money from some people and give it to others In fact that seems to be their entire focus spread the wealth around take up time on frivolous issues Dont deal with whats important dont deal with national security because we really dont want to talk about that Thats not whats important But that is what is important to us I watched the soldiers who guard the Tomb of the Unknowns and I was given some insight into the preparation that they have for that job and how difficult it is to get it Would that Members of Congress had a tiny little percentage of the dedication that these soldiers have for doing their jobs They do everything with perfection Perfection is not just the goal it is the standard that those people live up to We are falling far short of the standard that our military people uphold for our country We are so fortunate that we have men and women willing to serve and have been willing to serve since the founding of this country This Congress is falling short of the goals that they set I support our military I support the funding for our military and our troops the equipment the medical care and all that we are going to appropriate but I dont support this martial law way of operating I dont support the arrogance of this administration and this Congress to bring things up at the last minute and to disregard the needs of those people To put on the bills things that are irrelevant things they dont think they can pass any other way what a travesty what a shame What a shame on this Congress that we are doing this bill at the last minute and that we are putting these things on here We should be voting on appropriations for our military and honoring them here just before the holidays Madam Speaker I will ask my colleagues to vote no on this same day rule and no on the next rule so that we could stop and debate this and not be up against a deadline for a group of our Members to go to Copenhagen adding to the carbon problem while they are going over there to talk about it I yield back the balance of my time The yeas and nays were ordered The yeas and nays were ordered A recorded vote was ordered Madam Speaker I now would like to yield 3 minutes to another distinguished colleague from Texas Mr Hensarling Madam Speaker I now would like to yield to a third colleague from Texas Mr Culberson who has come to speak against this rule one of the most fiscally conservative Members of the House such time as he may consume Madam Speaker the West continues to be wellrepresented here I now yield 3 minutes to our colleague from Arizona Mr Flake Madam Speaker having a charge of misspeaking is very serious I would like therefore to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arizona Mr Flake to speak again on the rule Madam Speaker I want to say thank you to our colleague from Arizona for his very valuable input on the issue of earmarks and say that I join him in opposing all earmarks in any of our bills until we fix this broken system And I think what we need is a study of how these specific earmarks then get awarded since there seems to be open competition And I would welcome the majority to institute such a study and just see how open the competition is I now yield 3 minutes to my colleague from Iowa Mr King Madam Speaker you know Im sitting here listening to the crocodile tears particularly of my colleague from Maine who spoke earlier about the many people in her district who want to have jobs And it is the very policies that she and her party have passed in this session of Congress that have caused those people to lose their jobs What we need to do is let the American people keep their money Their money It is not the governments money It is the hardearned money of those who work in this country And let me point out even President Obama has said and Im going to quote November 18 2009 It is important though to recognize if we keep on adding to the debt even in the midst of this recovery that at some point people could lose confidence in the US economy in a way that can actually lead to a double dip recession But what are we doing today Adding to the debt with the support of the President Do they think the American people are not paying attention To the contrary more than ever the American people are paying attention to whats going on in this Congress and they have spoken in many many ways They have spoken through the polls they have spoken through election polls in terms of where theyre voting and theyre telling us every day this is not what they want this Congress to be doing They also are aware of the fact that this Congress is breaking every promise that it made before the majority was elected And I want to say with apologies to Elizabeth Barrett Browning and her sonnet No 43 how many ways can we count the promises that have been broken Many many ways Too many ways to talk about today But let me give some examplesone from Majority Leader Hoyer I think that is a very important pursuit Our committees and Members are served on both sides of the aisle by pursuing regular order Regular order gives to everybody the opportunity to participate in the process in a fashion which will effect in my opinion the most consensus and best product Again a letter to Majority Leader Hoyer from members of the Democrat Blue Dog and New Democratic Caucuses which said Committees must function thoroughly and inclusively and cooperation must ensue between the parties and the Houses to ensure that our legislative tactics enable rather than impede progress In general we must engender an atmosphere that allows partisan games to cease and collaboration to succeed We look forward to working with you to restore this institution And what are we getting Just the opposite Even Speaker Pelosi endorsed the idea of regular order with her spokesperson stating at the time The Speaker prefers to consider legislation in regular order and the committees of jurisdiction held hearings and markups on the current economic recovery bill In a few cases because of urgent financial crises the leadership agreed to use expedited procedures Lest we forget promises Democrats made in their 2006 document entitled A New Direction for America which promised that Bills should be developed following full hearings and open subcommittee and committee markups with appropriate referrals to other committees Members should have at least 24 hours to examine a bill prior to consideration at the subcommittee level And weve pointed out its barely been 12 hours since this bill the bill underlying this rule was presented Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open full and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives including a substitute As Mr Dreier pointed out earlier this is the first Congress in the history of this country that has not allowed that Members should have at least 24 hours to examine bill and conference report text prior to floor consideration Rules governing for debate must be reported before 10 pm for a bill to be considered the following day We can go on and on and on about promises broken The President said bills would be available for 72 hours The President promised he would post bills 5 days before signing them He said he would read every bill line for line and he said there would be no earmarks He would veto bills with earmarks This is a bill with 1700 earmarks Is he going to veto the bill I doubt it So here we have one promise after another thats broken How can the American people believe anything that is said by the other side after this Again theyre paying attention I know theyre paying attention and I believe that there will be consequences to the fact that these promises have been broken Madam Speaker I will enter into the Record a letter written by Republicans 173 of us to Speaker Pelosi on December 11 2009 asking that we not continue this practice Washington DC December 11 2009 Hon Nancy Pelosi Speaker of the House The Capitol Washington DC Dear Madam Speaker We write today to express our strong opposition to reports that the Democrat Majority is considering attaching unrelated and extremely controversial proposals such as an increase in the public debt limit to the Fiscal Year 2010 Defense Appropriations bill We object to maneuvers to use our troops as leverage to enact proposals that the Majority either cannot pass on their own or for which they wish to avoid directly voting on and we will oppose a Defense Appropriations package that includes such provisions Unfortunately there seems to be a pattern developing this year of using legislation that supports our men and women in uniform to pass other contentious proposals that are extraneous to our troops We should supply those who risk their lives for our country with the resources they need without conditions and without using them to accomplish other legislative goals House Republicans stand ready to help the Majority enact a defense bill that meets the needs of our troops but we will not assist your effort to use the troops to enact an increase in our national debt limit so as to finance the irresponsible spending policies of your party With that I reserve the balance of my time Madam Speaker I would just like to point out its not the role of Federal Government to provide jobs Its not our job to take money from some and give to others to try to make them dependent on the government I urge my colleagues Madam Speaker to defeat the previous question so an amendment can be added to the rule The amendment to the rule will provide for separate consideration of House Resolution 554 a resolution to require that legislation and conference reports be posted on the Internet for 72 hours prior to consideration by the House and does not affect the bill made in order by the rule I will insert the text of the amendment and extraneous materials immediately prior to the vote on the previous question and I ask my colleagues to vote no on the previous question and the rule I yield back the balance of my time The yeas and nays were ordered A recorded vote was ordered Speaker at the close of 2009 as we look to and prepare for a new year Im prompted to call attention to the remarkable American people who have once again weathered a difficult year with dignity and toughness Sometimes the Washington establishment forgets that the solutions to Americas problems lie outside this capital city Yes Americans from almost every walk of life are tightening their belts and making due with less this year but Americans continue to be an extraordinarily resourceful people who inspire me in my work every day As we prepare to celebrate Christmas entering in a new year I hope we can all draw inspiration from the American people We live in a Nation of innovators and hardworking entrepreneurs Their resourcefulness is unlimited The spirit of American opportunity lives and thrives among them And lets not forget the North Carolinians who with their characteristic generosity and work ethic illustrate the greatness at work in America even in seasons of considerable difficulty I look to them as a source of inspiration and hope People like those who call North Carolina home have always been the best hope for the preservation of our tradition of individual liberty and government by and for the people whether in good times or bad Mr Speaker Washington would do well to stop and watch listen and learn from everyday Americans as they go about their lives and do the things that help make our Nation great May God continue to bless us all

markup it was raised in the health care markup I have behind me the Medicare cuts and I understand they have been slightly reduced in home healthin the rebuildbut we are going to cut Medicare We are not going to cut it significantly in the fraud2 billion That is where the real waste is The Senator from Rhode Island came down here and said we are trying to scare people but when we offered the opportunity for the chairman of the committee to prohibit rationing of health care in this country both the chairman and the Senator from Rhode Island voted against it It was simple straightforward saying no matter what we do in health care we are not going to do what other countries have done and that is ration health care Straight upanddown votespartyline votes against it In fact we are going to ration health care That is what this bill does The way we are going to control cost is through the mechanisms outlined in this bill that are going to allow government bureaucrats to decide what you can get treated for when you can get treated for it and where you can get treated for it The rebuttal to that is In Medicare it is already illegal for them to ration care so we dont need a prohibition The fact is Medicare is rationing right now They are rationing virtual colonoscopies they are rationing bone densitometry they are rationing Epogen they are rationing Neupogen two key drugs to maintain survival during the treatment of chemotherapy They are practicing medicine So when given the opportunity to vote and put an absolute prohibition on the rationing of health care what did the chairman of the Finance Committee do He voted against that Because what he recognizes is the ultimate plan And the answer to Senator Burrs question is This will collapse It is not going to be sustainable The Medicare cuts wont be made by us We will put it off on a commission and say Oh we had to do it and the result of that will be rationing The other result will be what the Senator from Vermont actually wants which is a singlepayer governmentrun system That is why he is intellectually honest He brought it to the floor and said this is how I think we ought to solve health care We ought to have the government run it and we ought to have the government make the decisions He was honest about it That is where this bill is going So if you are a Medicare patient you should be concerned If you are a Medicare Advantage patient you should be concerned I have had criticism leveled at me because I do what the chairman of the Finance Committee suggestsI make competitive bidding for Medicare Advantage But there is a big difference Mine has no cuts in benefits They cut benefits 50 percent in terms of the Medicare Advantage differential There are three things you can do to fix health care in this country You can incentivize prevention and the treatment of chronic disease based on outcome you can create transparency so that purchasers in the market can actually make a judgment about value and quality and you can assist those who are on the lower rungs of the economic ladder to get the same kind of care we get Those are the three things you can do I readily admit we dont have a great competitive model in the insurance industry I want to change that We had Senator Wyden come to the floor and say that he loves the free enterprise spirit yet we want to put an artificial fix in terms of the insurance company in terms of what you have to have for a return What if an insurance company came up with 20 percent greater efficiency in terms of outcomes and benefits They still have to spend that money In the name of the free enterprise system we are going to kill free enterprise As a practicing physician I bristle at the way I run into insurance companies There is no question about it We need to fix that The point Senator Burr was making is this says it is this way or the highway when the option we offeredthe Patients Choice Actcuts taxes doesnt raise taxes expands exactly to the level or beyond of this bill and it does at in a faster rate It extends the life of Medicare It gives Medicaid patients the same kind of care we get But it was defeated in committee on a partyline vote It was filed as an amendment here but not accepted We had 10 amendments voted on from our side on 2400 pages of legislation10 amendments So it is not about being bipartisan it is about you have to take this or leave it What the American people ought to pray for is that somebody cant make the vote tonight That is what they should be praying for so that we can actually get the middlenot me not mine I understand I am way over here But we ought to get the middle of America and the middle of the Senate a bill that can run through this country and actually do what we say we all want to do There is a large difference of opinion and it is not rhetoric that is unfounded as Senator Burr outlined and as Dr Barrasso outlined with an estimate by NFIB of 16 million jobs lost That may be old data because who knows what the data is now We havent had a chance to look at it because 30 hours after the bill is introduced for cloture and the cloture motion is filed we are going to vote on it I am not sure this is a great way to run the country What is in the bill There are zero guarantees that taxpayers wont finance abortion There are zero prohibitions on the rationing of health carezero There is not one shred of evidence that we are not going to ultimately ration health care under this bill We are And the only reason you would vote against a rationing amendment is because you intend to see rationing carried out There are zero Senators required to enroll in either Medicaid or a governmentrun option either through OPM or Medicaid There are now 10 new taxes created There are 71 new government programs created There are 1697 times that the Secretary of HHS is going to write the regulations and based on CRS calculations there are between 15000 and 20000 new Federal employees who are going to be required to carry out this legislation There are 3607 times before we got the Reid amendment that the legislation says the word shall Shall is a very important word because the word shall takes away your options There is no option when the word shall is used The word shall also says whoever is directing the shall obviously has more wisdom more knowledge more experience than the person the shall is applied to What we have said is in all our wisdom in all our many years of practicing medicine and being involved in the care of patients that 3607 times we are going to tell the American people what to do One of the big shall alsos that I do not think will ever hold scrutiny before the Supreme Court is you shall buy an insurance policy That doesnt fit anywhere in the Constitution that I read If you do the legal research on it as my staff lawyers from the Judiciary Committee have done it is highly unlikely that will ever hold up So the whole premise of a large portion of the taxes collected in this bill will be out the window It also will totally change through adverse selection all of the insurance premiums in this country because if you do not have an individual mandate making people buy insurance the costs relative to the illness and the age even though we have compressed the ratios will rise exorbitantly There are still going to be 24 million people left without health insurance in this country There is a 10 billion cost just for the IRS implementation of this bill There is at least 25 billion in mandates placed on the States unfunded mandates Actually it is much higher now There is 28 billionplus in new taxes on employers There is 100 billion by conservative estimates in fraud and Medicare and Medicaid a year and this bill goes after 2 billion over 10 years So we are going to go after 2 billion out of 1 trillionnot 200 billion not 20 billionwe are going after 2 billion There is 118 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage but only for those people who do not live in the State of Florida and a couple of other places If you happen to live in Oklahoma citizens under the Medicare Advantage are going to lose This is now over 500 billion in new taxes on Americans There is a quarter of a trillion dollars not in this in expense that everybody knows is an expense We are going to restore the SGR We are going to fix that And that quarter of a trillion dollars is based on no increase in physicians over the next 10 years How many in this body think we are not going to increase the pay of physicians in Medicare under the next 10 years The assumptions in the CBO report that accompanied the Reid amendment if you read what they said they said it is highly unlikely So that is a quarter of a trillion dollars even though it was not in their numbers It also said if in fact the cuts came through which they thought highly unlikely that they would and if they didnt then the fiscal numbers associated with the bill are out the window The final number everybody ought to be paying attention to is 121 trillion 121 trillion is what our kids owe outside of owing ourselves11 trillion That is going to double in the next 10 years Anybody with a lick of common sense who looked at the numbers on this bill would say Washington your accounting programs arent any different from Enron The same fate of those who created the Enron scam ought to apply to the Congress of the United States The very fact we are not considering an SGR fix is evidence of that At least you have to add a quarter of a trillion dollars every 10 years to this bill just to keep doctors even And dont forget the fact that 34 million new Americans over the next 10 years are going to enter Medicareare going to enter Medicare What are the alternatives I will not offer other amendments and make the chairman object to them because I know his answer He calls it a stunt It is not a stunt when you do not have vigorous amendments offered on the Senate floor It is not a stunt The stunt is not allowing amendments to be offered To allow only 10 of our amendments to be offered on this bill is beneath the dignity of the Senateon the biggest bill in the last 100 years in this Congress the only bill in the last 100 years that is going to affect every American in a personal way but also in a fiscal way a financial way There was an amendment to be offered a conscience protection for physicians We didnt get a vote on it Should we force physicians in this country to perform abortions or should we have a vote on whether if they have a conscience protection they ought to be exempted from that Should that not be a part of health care reform We are not going to get a vote on that How about an amendment to reduce the waste fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid Programs and protecting Medicare benefits And increasing the fraud and waste from 2 billion to 100 billion over the next 10 years that is just 10 percent of what is there We are not going to get a vote on that It is not going to be available The American people are not going to get to hear the debate on that They are not going to make up their mind Why You dont want them to hear the debate on it If you truly wanted to have a debate on fraud we would have a debate on fraud and we would have an amendment saying put your stamp down or are you for the people who are defrauding Or are you for the status quo We are for the status quo We are for the well connected The amendment on rationing that I talked aboutor an amendment to limit the bureaucratic increase associated with this bill which is an amendment I offered we are not going to get a debate on that That is a very straightforward amendment It just says we are not going to increase the number of bureaucrats to implement this bill We are going to drive efficiency in HHS that is where this is going to We are going to say You cant get a net increase in bureaucrats so get more efficient Since we are running 14 trillion or 15 trillion deficits that is something that everybody else in the country would be doing but we are not going to do that We are not going to allow an opportunity for a vote or debate on that We are not going to have that opportunity I have heard the majority mention several times that we didnt have anything to offer We offered the Patients Choice Act CBO said it cut longterm costs on Medicaid that it saved money on Medicare They said it saved 1 trillion over the first 10 years for the State and the estimates Because we couldnt get the commitment that was made to us by the chairman of the HELP Committee that he would score the bill the bill didnt ever get scored by CBObut an outside score says it saves at least 70 billion the first 10 years and far in excess of that afterwards It covers more people than this bill saves personal choice doesnt put somebody between you and your doctor I heard the Senator from Rhode Island say we were lying about that happening It is happening today both from insurance companies and Medicare and Medicaid So if we really wanted to reform health care we would be attacking that Instead we are going to make it worse Let me tell you how we are going to make it worse We are going to use cost comparative effectiveness which is exactly what the US Task Force on Prevention Services did They used cost comparative effectiveness and when they looked at breast cancer they said it is not cost effective to screen women before the age of 50 You know what They are right It is not cost effective But it certainly is clinically effective especially if your wife is the one who is 40 and has breast cancer and it was found by a mammogram You see judgment goes out the window What do we do We reversed that finding one of the first things we did as we started the debate Are we going to do that every time the US Preventive Services Task Force issues a ruling that is cost effective but not clinically effective Are we going to do that every time the cost comparative effectiveness panel says You will do this and the American people say That isnt right the American Cancer Society says That isnt right Every time we get one of those rulings will we have to pass a piece of legislation to change it The purpose of the three panels is well intended The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission is well intended Help us cut costs But the only way you go for cost is through prevention and management of chronic disease You are not going to cut costs any other way because 75 percent of everything we spend is on five chronic diseases So unless you attack the real problem the real disease with our health care system you are not going to solve it The lack of art in medicine will become readily apparent in 2015 2016 and 2017 We will see bureaucratic decisions in between a patient and their provider That is not a scare tactic That is absolute fact We have it now with Medicare It is there If I have a woman who is 55 years of age today and I order bone density testing on her and find she has severe osteoporosis I put her on medicine but am forbidden by Medicare to do the followup exam that is clinically necessary to see if the medicine is working and not only that under Medicare rules she cant even use her own money to buy that test So 2 years later we do the test and we havent corrected her disease Now we change medicines to try to find out but we cant find out again So she ultimately falls and breaks her hip There is a 20percent mortality rate from falling and breaking ones hip But those are the rules we are operating under now right now that you want to expand Government isnt ever compassionate It is never compassionate People are compassionate Thought has to be in the middle of the practice of medicine not distant thought near thought The very fact that an insurance company tells the doctors what they can and cannot do is no worse than what we are getting ready to do with the rest of governmentrun health care We didnt fix that problem We didnt address that problem with this We didnt guarantee that you could walk with your feet We said Here is how much money you can earn but we didnt address that I will give two examples Two people I have taken care of for over 15 years both had no clinical indications that they had anything wrong I contacted the insurance company I thought they needed an MRI of the brain Both of them were denied I got friends who are radiologists to do their MRI They both had brain tumors One is still alive What we are setting up isnt any different than what you have a complaint and gripe about now with the insurance industry You didnt fix that in this bill There is no health care reform in this bill There is health coverage expansion but there is no reform One of those people is still alive but had we followed either Medicare guidelines cost comparative effectiveness panel guidelines which would have forbidden doing an MRI that one person out of the two would be dead today So as we sit here and look at our health care system my biggest worry is I will be in Medicare I will get rationed I know that The way we are going about it that is what is going to happen We are going to ration care We will not vote to not ration it You know it is going to be rationed or you would have voted for the amendment in committee that provided a prohibition But my real concern is not my generation My real concern is those who will follow us with 121 trillion worth of debt and the fact that every one of those is 25 years of age and younger today Twenty years from now they will be responsible for 1 million of both debt and unfunded liabilities for which we will have to collect on average 70000 a year just to pay the interest on what we are sending them Before they pay the rest of their income taxes before they pay payroll taxes before they pay unemployment taxes before they send their kids to school before they buy health insurance before they buy a home before they buy transportation the real worry that should be in front of this country which is the No 1 issue on the publics mind is How do we get out of this financial mess That is the No 1 issue on peoples minds It is not health care I have no hopes of convincing my colleagues that through 25 years of practicing medicine dealing with Medicare dealing with Medicaid that that is of any value to you Because we are hellbent on passing a health care bill and dealing to make sure we can and creating inequities throughout this country and dividing our country We heard the Senator from Rhode Island characterize us as liars birthers supporters of the Aryan nation That is what I heard I sat and listened to it I think he doth protest too much for he knows that is not true There is nobody on our side of the aisle who cares any less than anybody on the other side of the aisle about fixing health care The rub is you believe the government is the most powerful thing and the best way to do it We dont agree with that We actually believe in the American people We actually believe in the entrepreneurial spirit of the average American making good decisions for themselves every day doing things we never do which is prioritizing where their money is going to go and how they are going to spend it and working like heck to advance the cause of their own family their own freedom and their own liberty You dont believe that because if you did you would never put this kind of bill on the floor This bill limits liberty This bill says you shall Think of the first big step in this bill In the United States you no longer have the ability to not buy health insurance If you have 12 million in the bank and you want to put that at risk and say I dont want to you either have to pay a fine a tax or you have to buy health insurance So where is the liberty and where is the commerce clause in that and where does that tie in with individual liberty and individual responsibility We say If you dont want to be responsible then we will make you responsible We dont say You have to suffer the consequences of your lack of responsibility What built this country was people figuring out if you dont act responsibly it is going to cost you We are going to put a block on that and say You dont have to act responsibly You dont have to act in your own best economic interest Dont worry We will take care of it Jefferson warned of that One of the Founders of this country warned us against doing the very thing we are doing today If you read the Federalist Papers you will see what Madison wrote about the welfare clause and the commerce clause He said whenever the Senate starts to think about claiming it means something different than it does here is what we want you to know It doesnt It is very limited in scope I said yesterday in a press conference that this country is at the point of a crisis of confidence such as we have not seen in hundreds of years It is true Whether you are a very liberal individual or a very conservative individual you dont have any confidence in us The reason you dont is because we dont act in the countrys best interest We act in our political best interest Republicans are equally guilty We look at partisan issues rather than principled issues What we miss in all that is the best right thing for the country We are missing it with this bill We are missing the best right thing for the country Would the Senator yield for a question If we are going to tax tanning salons why dont we tax anybody who goes to the beach Because true sunlight is much worse for your skin than a tanning salon So if the intention was to prevent disease why wouldnt we tax it where most of the disease occurs Or how about kids sports in the summer Lets tax kids baseball Or swimming Lets tax all the swimming pools because we have exposure to UV light This shows the precariousness and the silliness of a large portion of this and I yield back President if in fact we got rid of 50 percent of the fraud in Medicare and Medicaid we would generate 600 billion every 10 years more than offsetting the cuts that have been outlined in this bill How long have we known and how long has Medicare been in trouble that we havent fixed it We will not fix it We will do exactly what the Senator says what we always do what we have done since I have been in this body We put the credit card into the machine and say Transfer this to your grandkids We take no pain ourselves What is lacking in our country today is moral character to lead on the basis of sacrifice It should start with us as Senators in this body Mr President I understand our time has expired President I thank the Chair and I look forward to hearing the remarks in the cloakroom of the chairman of the Finance Committee 
S_TN_CORKER,2009-12-20,2007_2009; 2007_2009; 2007_2009; 2007_2009,0098; 0099; 0100; 0101, Will the Senator yield I know he cares deeply about his patients and continues to treat patients as he serves in the Senate What he has done is pointed out the fact that there will be much interruption changes in the physicians and patients relationship But the big picture is what the Senator is concerned about too that is the tremendous indebtedness this country has by the fact thatthe good chairman of the Finance Committee is here today listening patiently and I know this has to be painful to himhalf the reform we are talking about is actually putting people in Medicaid a program that 40 percent of physicians will not see and 50 percent of specialists will not see Last weekend the New York Times talked about many physicians prescribing antipsychotic drugs to young people because they dont want to deal with them on Medicaid So half this reform is people going into this type of program and half the money is coming from Medicare which is insolvent We have spent all this time all kinds of bipartisan meetings I know you spoke about the issue of partisanship I know the good chairman is here We early on said we wanted to join in health care reform We just didnt want to take money from Medicare which was an insolvent program to fund it What was the major building block of this program Taking 464 billion from Medicare to fund reform We were in essence blocked out on the front end saying something we thought was the wrong type of principle to build upon So if I understand correctly of the new patients going into Medicaid 50 percent of the money comes from an insolvent program We are not dealing with the doc fix Much of the savings they have talked about is just like the doc fix that back in 1997 the AMA both sides of the aisle agreed to do something to save money for Medicare As the Senator knows now the Reid amendment takes out all the doc fix now with a 285 billion gap over the next 10 years to deal with physicians It is another example of how we dont have the courage We put in place cuts We are not going to do that We know what damage that will cause to patients In this particular case we should not do that But the fact is many of these cuts that have been discussed will never take place They will never take place At the end of the day I come back to the very thing you talked about that is we have 12 trillion in debt 386 trillion in unfunded liabilities for Medicare alone and here we are passing a bill that is using up the resources we might otherwise use to make it solvent Instead of doing that we are leveraging a whole new entitlement I heard some of the pundits this morning parroting some of the things I have heard from my friends on the other side of the aisle Lets pass this bill We know it is not very good but we will fix it as we move along What I fear is the way we are going to fix it we are going to fix it by adding tremendous debt on future generations My guess is over the next very short period2 or 3 monthsthe other side of the aisle is going to come right back up here with a huge several hundred billion dollar unpaid bill to deal with one of these issues we have been talking about That is the way business is done here

COSTELLO COSTA and RUSH changed their vote from aye to no Messrs PAUL BAIRD GUTIERREZ JOHNSON of Georgia LYNCH ACKERMAN Ms DeGETTE and Mrs NAPOLITANO changed their vote from no to aye So the amendment was rejected The result of the vote was announced as above recorded By unanimous consent Mr Hoyer was allowed to speak out of order Welcoming Our Armed Forces Let me say to the gentleman from Tennessee let me explain the purpose behind the provision which your amendment seeks to strike And I say that I would be glad to work with the chairman and with the Member at this time striking the provision that I inserted in the committee that you objected to and wont ask for a recorded vote So let me explain the background behind this amendment and I think if we can all work together I think we can make investors safer and make a better system If the body will recall and the chairman on December 12 of last year about a year ago Bernie Madoff was arrested for committing the largest financial fraud in the history of the country It was a tremendous scama 65 million Ponzi scheme which defrauded nonprofits universities and pension funds and wiped out the savings of literally tens of thousands of families and citizens Now to do this Bernie Madoff operated two separate entities one was a broker dealer and one was an investment adviser The fraud occurred with the investor adviser That is where the fraud occurred The investment adviser was registered with the SEC The investment adviser Madoffs investor adviser was subject to examination by the SEC but I would point out to the chairman of the full committee and the gentleman from Tennessee they never examined the investor adviser They never examined it Madoff operated a brokerdealer in the same premises and under the same name And it was examined was subject to examination by the SEC and by FINRA I was saying let FINRA go ahead and examine the investment advisers these dual operations where you have both FINRA inspected the brokerdealer at least every other year but the fraud didnt occur there it occurred in the investment adviser FINRA lacked the authority to go in and examine the investor adviser They couldnt examine it And my provision I put in the committee said let them be able to as they examine the brokerdealer let them go in and look at the books of the investment adviser if youre operating a dual operation Had they had the right they would have gone in and they would have discovered this fraud The SEC which had the right never did it Now as I said earlier maybe theres another solution The SEC has said we dont want FINRA taking over our jurisdiction What Id like to say is lets make sure the SEC starts doing their job Lets make sure that they start examining these investment advisers Someone needs to The average investment adviser is only examined once every 10 years Bernie Madoffs investment adviser was never examined Its the kind of gap in regulation that causes disasters It causes scams it causes Bernie Madoffs of the world to get along for decades That is why I introduced this amendment the provision which were now striking Now going forward we at least need to look at this We need to know that there are 500 or 600 of these investment advisers and broker dealers dual operations And we need to make clear that the SEC somewhere that they have the authority to examine both investment advisers and brokerdealers If they want to perform that missionand I know one thing the chairman has done he has added more money for the SEC I think that is part of the answer but I think this committee the Congress as we go forward needs to make sure they do their job And there was a monumental failure of the SEC and if they dont do their job or we find they dont and they have the resources lets give it to someone else I yield back the remainder of my time Will the gentleman yield I appreciate that and I think that is a logical solution to that And at this time I will support the gentlemans amendment to strike the provision And as I said when I brought this provision up I wanted to highlight the fact that this is how Bernie Madoff you know he got away with operating these two operations on the same premises and we need to do thethe regulators need to do a better job someone of being able to look across those operations Madam Chair I have an amendment at the desk made in order under the rule The Acting CHAIR The Clerk will designate the amendment The text of the amendment is as follows Amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by Mr Bachus as

Members to perform the duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed by this section as though under clause 8a of rule I Point of Order Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Madam Speaker as my colleagues know we have been here before This is the same point of order that has been raised against almost every appropriations measure during this Congress and each time it is used to discuss something other than its intended purpose I would want to respond to my good colleague from Arizona that I too share concerns about the earmarking process and I encourage him to become a cosponsor on the fair elections bill As we have in Maine public financing takes away much of the scrutiny around the link between campaign contributions and earmarks But once again this particular debate is about delaying consideration of this bill and ultimately stopping it altogether I hope my colleagues will again vote yes so we can consider this important legislation on its merits and not stop it on a procedural motion This rule provides for enactment of legislation to fund our Nations defense The brave men and women who serve in the military particularly those who are currently at war in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve a swift enactment of this legislation This legislation that we will take up later today will also divert TARP money to programs that create and save jobs across the country We do this by investing 75 billion of TARP money into highways transit school renovation hiring teachers police firefighters supporting our small businesses funding job training and affordable housing And for those hardest hit by the recession this bill also provides emergency relief by extending programs like unemployment benefits COBRA FMAP our health care funding for the State and the child care tax credit Those who oppose this measure can vote against it on final passage We must consider this rule and we must pass this critical legislation today I have the right to close but in the end I will urge my colleagues to vote yes and consider the rule Madam Speaker I reserve the balance of my time Madam Speaker again I want to urge my colleagues to vote yes on this motion to consider so that we can debate and pass this and the other important items covered by this rule Madam Speaker I yield back the balance of my time Madam Speaker for the purpose of debate only I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina Dr Foxx All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only General Leave I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 976 Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Madam Speaker House Resolution 976 provides for the consideration of the Senate amendment to HR 3326 House Joint Resolution 64 HR 4314 and the Senate amendment to HR 2847 For the Senate amendment to HR 3326 the rule makes in order a motion to concur in the Senate amendment with the House amendment provides 1 hour of debate controlled by the Committee on Appropriations and waives all points of order against consideration of the motion except those arising under clause 10 of rule XI The rule provides for consideration of HJ Res 64 under a closed rule It provides for 1 hour of debate controlled by the Committee on

rule XXI and it waives all points of order against provisions in the joint resolution The rule provides for consideration of HR 4314 under a closed rule It provides for 1 hour of debate controlled by the Committee on Ways and Means It provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions It waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI and it waives all points of order against provisions in the bill For the Senate amendment to HR 2847 the rule makes in order a motion to concur in the Senate amendment with the House amendment It provides 1 hour of debate on the motion controlled by the Committee on Appropriations and it waives all points of order against consideration of the motion except those arising under clause 10 of rule XXI The rule provides that in the engrossment of the House amendment to the Senate amendment to HR 2847 the Clerk shall add the text of HR 2920 as passed by the House The rule also provides that measures may be considered under suspension of the rules at any time during the remainder of the first session of the 111th Congress The rule waives the requirement of a twothirds vote to consider a rule on the same day it is reported from the Rules Committee for the remainder of the first session of the 111th Congress The rule provides that the Chair of the Committee on Appropriations may insert in the Congressional Record explanatory materials on the Senate amendments and the motions regarding HR 3326 and HR 2847 The rule provides that on any legislative day before January 12 2010 the Speaker may dispense with organizational or legislative business The rule provides that before January 12 2010 the Chair may declare the House adjourned The rule provides for pro forma sessions until the House adjourns sine die And finally the rule provides that on any legislative day of the first session of the 111th Congress the Speaker may declare the House adjourned Madam Speaker the rule before us today allows the House to consider the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2010 which is the last appropriations bill for this fiscal year The conference agreement on HR 3326 provides over 363 billion towards protecting our troops abroad and taking better care of their families at home To help protect our troops this bill provides increased funding for the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle Fund and for the procurement of new Humvees and of new heavy and medium tactical vehicles This is particularly important given the casualty rate and the difficulties our soldiers are experiencing in Afghanistan HR 3326 increases pay for all servicemembers by 34 percent and it fully funds the requested end strength levels for active reserve and selected reserve personnel The bill provides over 29 billion for top oftheline medical care including 120 million for traumatic brain injury and psychological health and it increases funding for the wounded the ill and injured warrior programs The conference agreement also includes over 472 million for family advocacy programs and it fully funds the family support and yellow ribbon programs The bill also includes 20 million for the Army National Guard family assistance centers and reintegration programs but this bill cannot provide for the common defense without a common effort In my home State of Maine there are men and women who work every day to help in this effort The funding in this bill would have been wasted if it werent for the efforts of the welders designers and metal workers of the Bath Ironworks of the skilled factory workers and assembly men at Vintech in Biddeford Maine of the worldclass machinists and engineers at Pratt and Whitney in North Berwick or of the dedicated laborers and nuclear engineers at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard This is a clear example of why the bills before us today are so interconnected Our economic security and our national security are inextricably linked and our economic security is still in dire straits Madam Speaker if you were sitting at a boardroom table on Wall Street today you might hear the employees with Goldman Sachs discussing their 1 billion in profits or bonuses or you might hear employees of Citibank discussing raises for their top executives You might also hear that the stock market has gone up 60 percent since the spring You might even hear terms like economic recovery or rebound So if you are sitting at that boardroom table on Wall Street you might think that the economy has fully bounced back and that we are out of the woods You may start to believe that there is nothing but smooth sailing ahead Yet if you were at a kitchen table on Main Street in my home State of Maine you would hear a very different story Rather than talk of large profits you would hear families discussing a savings account that has all but disappeared Instead of listening to talk of raises or bonuses you would hear families debating cutbacks on food or cutbacks on health care Instead of hearing phrases like economic recovery or rebound you would hear terms like high unemployment and mounting debt For the big banks on Wall Street the economic recovery may be at hand but for the millions of unemployed workers and for the thousands of small businesses that are struggling to get by the economic recovery is still a long way off In my State and all across the country there are millions of Americans who want to get back to work but they need us to lend the same helping hand that we gave to Wall Street in its time of need Madam Speaker the rule before us today allows for the consideration of the Jobs for Main Street Act which will move us down that road This legislation invests in our Nations infrastructure and it puts more Americans back to work by providing 48 billion to rebuild and repair our national transportation system This investment provides a measurable return not only by creating and preserving jobs but by literally building the foundation for a longterm economic recovery This bill will also preserve the jobs of teachers of police officers and of firefighters For those who have already lost their jobs the Jobs Act extends unemployment benefits for 2 months and it maintains the current COBRA subsidy These programsthese investments the economic lifelineshave a real impact Just this week I heard from a constituent of mine who said these words Something needs to be done There are less than 4 weeks left for my husbands unemployment After that we wont be able to pay the rent and we will be out on the streets with a child under 2 years old Every day I wonder what is going to happen next and I even have nightmares You bail out these large banks which then only raise our interest rates and lower our credit linesand for what That doesnt help the little guy like us Do something to help us Madam Speaker we have the opportunity and we have the obligation to take the bailout money that was used as a lifeline to Wall Street and to give that money back to the American people and to those who have been hit the hardest by these tough economic times The COBRA subsidy we passed this spring began expiring a few weeks ago If we dont act now it will completely disappear by January 1 In my State full payment for COBRA uses up nearly 90 percent of the average unemployment benefits That means outofwork Mainers end up with only about 150 a month left after paying the full cost of their health insurance We need to act now and we need to act fast to ensure that Main Street recovers If we do not act we will have only assured that Wall Street keeps their bonuses while American families lose their benefits We will have only watched Wall Street get rid of their debt while watching small businesses take on more Madam Speaker we have already put more than enough into shoring up Wall Street Now we need to focus on creating jobs for the average American that will rebuild our economy from the bottom up I reserve the balance of my time Madam Speaker I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York a member of the Committee on Rules Mr Arcuri Madam Speaker by direction of the Committee on Rules I call up House Resolution 973 and ask for its immediate consideration The Clerk read the resolution as follows H Res 973 Resolved That the requirement of clause 6a of rule XIII for a twothirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is waived with respect to any resolution reported on the legislative day of December 16 2009 Madam Speaker for the purpose of debate only I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina Dr Foxx All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only General Leave I also ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 973 Madam Speaker House Resolution 973 waives clause 6a of rule XIII which requires a twothirds vote to consider a rule on the same day it is reported from the Rules Committee This waiver applies to any resolutions reported on the legislative day of December 16 2009 This will allow the House to consider today important legislation including legislation to ensure the funding of our military in addition to measures to put people back to work Madam Speaker we must act quickly to deliver the bills before us today that will fund our military and get people back to work Today the House will take up several measures that will fund our military and make critical investments in the Nations infrastructure in order to put people back to work We have the opportunity today to take the bailout money that was used as a lifeline to Wall Street and give that money back to the American people and those who have been hit hardest by these tough economic times The legislation that we will take up later today will divert the TARP money to programs that will create and save jobs across the country We do this by investing 75 billion of TARP money into highways to transit to school renovation to hiring teachers police and firefighters to supporting small businesses job training and affordable housing For those hit hardest by the recession this bill also provides emergency relief by extending programs like Unemployment Benefits COBRA and FMAP which is health care funding for our States and the child care tax credit These are measures that we must pass to build a foundation for longterm economic recovery This is not an ordinary day and given the importance of this legislation I hope Members on both sides of the aisle will support this rule so that we can move quickly to enact these critically important measures I wish as so many of my colleagues wish that we werent faced with such difficult problems I wish that when the Democrats took over the majority we werent saddled with two wars a recession and a 13 trillion deficit But wishing wont make these problems go away There is real urgency in the actions before us today and I truly hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in supporting this rule to allow us to move forward Later in the day we will debate the merits of all of this legislation and the grave implications of not passing these bills But right now I urge my colleagues to support this rule and allow us to move forward on the debate to complete the work that we were sent here to do I reserve the balance of my time My good friend from North Carolina has suggested that this isnt an emergency I would say that I hear every day from constituents in my district who feel that we are in a time of emergency In Maine we have 20000 unemployed workers who are facing the end of their unemployment benefits A very critical thing that we are about to talk about today is the extension of unemployment benefits Now we are anxious for the economy to improve but the fact is in my State unemployment benefits are the fourth largest payroll That is a tragedy that we have to deal with We have to make sure that those people in the middle of a cold winter dont go without their vital support and that our State doesnt go without a critical part of our economy Many of those people cant even stand a delay because the fact is if they go for even a few days or weeks without their benefits theyve already hit the end of their credit card limits theyve already gone as far as they can possibly go Many workers have talked to me about the fact that they are using their COBRA subsidy they were laid off and the fact is this extended that as well As far as Im concerned there are many critical things in this bill This is the time to get it passed People say to me all the time When are you going to get something done in Washington As far as Im concerned this is something we have to get done and we need to get back to work today I reserve the balance of my time Madam Speaker I do want to thank my colleague the ranking member on the committee both for his history lesson and also for extending holiday greetings to those across the country I do appreciate that as a new Member I often learn bits of the past from the things that he discusses with us and I want to join him in thanking our hardworking staff He is absolutely right We were here late into the evening and we were here early in the morning I know that my colleagues put in many hours and that our staffs work very hard and I want them to know I appreciate greatly their hard work on our behalf and for dealing with many of the challenges we often have before us which make our procedural challenges even more difficult as we try to determine how to get so much work done that is before us and with so much more to do That is why we are here todayto talk about this sameday rule to talk about the work that is before us I yield as much time as he is interested in consuming to my good colleague from Colorado Mr Perlmutter Will the gentleman yield I am happy to yield back again to my wonderful colleague from Colorado I want to answer one thing The two of you have been entered into a colloquy a very interesting one going back to Kennedy I am happy to engage in a colloquy with both of my colleagues here but let me just make one point to my much more senior and wellinformed Members No I dont think actually they are all older Anyway I just want to say that while this has been a very interesting history lesson and while I greatly appreciate my colleague from Colorado and his understanding of the financial services industry and of this world that weve been working so hard on to both regulate and to deal with much of my colleague from Californias remarks have been referring to President Kennedy and to President Reagan which were very different eras I just want to remind my colleagues on the floor that we are here at the end of the Bush administration When President Obama came to office yes the Democrats had been here for 2 years before and there were things that we were unable to fix when we were simply in the majority The fact is that President Obama and this particular Congressand I came here as a freshmaninherited the worst recession since the Great Depression two wars that werent paid for a broken health care system and a 1950s energy policy That is what we have had to deal with As my colleagues know this has not been an easy year We are here over and over again attempting to deal with this I yield 1 minute to my colleague from Colorado Mr Perlmutter Thank you to my colleague from North Carolina for her thoughts While we dont always agree I appreciate her reminding us about the soldiers who have fallen about their families about her visit to Arlington Cemetery I want to concur I had the privilege of visiting the cemetery myself this week Not only did I also grieve for those families who were there visiting the gravestones of their loved ones and their family members and many who were just there to think about the people who they didnt even know who served for us I was also tremendously proud to see the thousands of wreaths that decorated those graves that had been brought down from my home State the State of Maine in honor of our fallen soldiers There were 16000 that were brought to Arlington Cemetery and there were many people who traveled with them to make sure that we show the proper respect for our military for our soldiers and for those who served their country in the past and virtually every day I want to just say that we are here today in part to talk about making sure that there is adequate funding for our military Yes we all wish that our colleagues in the Senate had acted faster on this bill that we werent dealing with continuing resolutions but this is the particular situation that we are in It is very important that we finish our work before the end of the year before the end of the holidays that we recognize our soldiers our current military and many of the other needs in this bill many of which will be discussed as soon as we finish the debate on this sameday rule Madam Speaker in closing I just want to say that the rule before us this morning simply allows the consideration of these measures to move forward We have heard a lot about the process this morning I want to simply state for the record in the 109th Congress before I was a Member of this body the Republican majority reported out over 20 rules that allowed for sameday consideration Madam Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote for this rule and for the underlying measures before us today These programs are too important Our constituents are in too much turmoil to slow this process down any further I urge a yes vote on the previous question and on the rule The material previously referred to by Ms Foxx is as follows Amendment to H Res 973 Offered by Ms Foxx of North Carolina At the end of the resolution insert the following new section Sec 2 On the third legislative day after the adoption of this resolution immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV and without intervention of any point of order the House shall proceed to the consideration of the resolution H Res 554 amending the Rules of the House of Representatives to require that legislation and conference reports be available on the Internet for 72 hours before consideration by the House and for other purposes The resolution shall be considered as read The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and any amendment thereto to final adoption without intervening motion or demand for division of the question except 1 one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Rules 2 an amendment if offered by the Minority Leader or his designee and if printed in that portion of the Congressional Record designated for that purpose in clause 8 of rule XVIII at least one legislative day prior to its consideration which shall be in order without intervention of any point of order or demand for division of the question shall be considered as read and shall be separately debatable for twenty minutes equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent and 3 one motion to recommit which shall not contain instructions Clause 1c of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of House Resolution 554 The information contained herein was provided by Democratic Minority on multiple occasions throughout the 109th Congress The Vote on the Previous Question What It Really Means This vote the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule is not merely a procedural vote A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow the opposition at least for the moment to offer an alternative plan It is a vote about what the House should be debating Mr Clarence Cannons Precedents of the House of Representatives VI 308311 describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House Cannon cites the Speakers ruling of January 13 1920 to the effect that the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition in order to offer an amendment On March 15 1909 a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry asking who was entitled to recognition Speaker Joseph G Cannon RIllinois said The previous question having been refused the gentleman from New York Mr Fitzgerald who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment is entitled to the first recognition Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic majority they will say the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution and has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever But that is not what they have always said Listen to the definition of the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress page 56 Heres how the Rules Committee described the rule using information form Congressional Quarterlys American Congressional Dictionary If the previous question is defeated control of debate shifts to the leading opposition member usually the minority Floor Manager who then manages an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the pending business Deschlers Procedure in the US House of Representatives the subchapter titled Amending Special Rules states a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules opens the resolution to amendment and further debate Chapter 21 section 212 Section 213 continues Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon Clearly the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Democratic majoritys agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan I yield back the balance of my time and I move the previous question on the resolution Madam Speaker I send to the desk a privileged concurrent resolution and ask for its immediate consideration The Clerk read the concurrent resolution as follows H Con Res 223 Resolved by the House of Representatives the Senate concurring That when the House adjourns on any legislative day from Wednesday December 16 2009 through Saturday January 2 2010 on a motion offered pursuant to this concurrent resolution by its Majority Leader or his designee it stand adjourned sine die or until the time of any reassembly pursuant to section 3 of this concurrent resolution and that when the Senate adjourns on any day from Friday December 18 2009 through Saturday January 2 2010 on a motion offered pursuant to this concurrent resolution by its Majority Leader or his designee it stand adjourned sine die or until the time of any reassembly pursuant to section 3 of this concurrent resolution Sec 2 When the House adjourns on any legislative day of the second session of the One Hundred Eleventh Congress from Tuesday January 5 2010 through Saturday January 9 2010 on a motion offered pursuant to this concurrent resolution by its Majority Leader or his designee it shall stand adjourned until noon on Tuesday January 12 2010 or until the time of any reassembly pursuant to section 3 of this concurrent resolution whichever occurs first and

shall notify the Members of the House and the Senate respectively to reassemble at such place and time as they may designate if in their opinion the public interest shall warrant it Madam Speaker before I yield to one of my colleagues I do want to mention one point of concern I have in the bill The conference agreement on HR 3326 is the first step towards cutting wasteful defense spending but it is by no means perfect It is no means the last step that we must take The conference agreement provides 465 million for the development of an alternative engine for the F35 Joint Strike Fighter This provision represents businesses as usual in Washington for providing funds for an engine thats already being built and already being built well There is no need to devote our precious Federal dollars to a wasteful alternative engine program at this time when Americans are struggling to find jobs to pay their medical bills and to put food on the table Every defense bill that we spend wisely contributes to our national security and every defense dollar that we waste hampers our economic security Madam Speaker I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois Mr Hare Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington Mr Dicks a member of the Committee on Appropriations Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Washington Mr Dicks Madam Speaker I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas Ms JacksonLee Ms JACKSONLEE of Texas Let me thank the distinguished gentlelady from Maine Madam Speaker I wish to start by wishing America a very Merry Christmas and to many other Americans a happy holiday And Id like to give my thanks to the Rules Committee and the staff of the Rules Committee for doing an enormous job Our chairwoman Louise Slaughter has been at the forefront of the major successes we have had on behalf of the American people I offer my appreciation as well for Chairman John Murtha who in his astuteness and commitment to the men and women of the United States military finds many of us today supporting the Defense appropriations bill even as we begin to consider the next steps in Afghanistan But why am I standing here today to be able to speak to my colleagues and the American people One because history gets distorted We are in this predicament because the last administration of Republican leadership took away our surplus that had been created in the 1990s They dashed and dashed and destroyed and devastated Isnt it interesting that youd come now to complain about a leadership President and Democratic leadership in Congress that have had to make the political sacrifice to ensure that Americans can work And so let me just set the record straight The American Recovery and Reinvestment Actthat secured no Republican votescreated 35 million jobs and gave 95 percent of American workers a tax cut And today as we speak we are cutting the job loss every single month Why Im standing here today is because Im enthusiastically supporting this rule because we will then pass a jobs bill and I will be able to go home to those in the 18th Congressional District who told me over the Thanksgiving holiday as I was participating in feeding those on Thanksgiving Day I lost my job from a major corporation Well Im going to tell them that because of infrastructure funding 48 billion in fact that we will be able to invest in highways and mass transit One billion dollars in Federal investments to highways creates 27800 jobs Is there something wrong with that The wrongness of it is that the other side is not thinking about the American people and has not had a good thought about how to invest in America This jobs bill is going to keep States from cutting teachers and police and firefighters and its going to provide job training I am proud that they have taken my ideas and many of our ideas but work that I have done on summer youth jobs Theyre going to put 150000 people in job training positions One of the ideas that can be incorporated that I have put forward in a bill is to make sure that people can keep their unemployment while they are in a job training and receive a stipend Dignity jobs is what were talking about Ms JACKSONLEE of Texas And then my small business friends once and for all well answer your question about getting loans But the big thing is Riverside General Hospital because of the astuteness of those who worked on the Defense bill will get 1 million for the first time an African American hospital to help our soldiers with post traumatic stress disorder I have worked on this for 4 years Its a celebration Merry Christmas to America Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland Mr Cummings Madam Speaker I rise to discuss at least one thing my colleague and friend from North Carolina mentioned Im a Northerner so I cant claim to be an expert on crocodiles but I assume that when youre talking about crocodile tears youre talking about being insincere and I want to say I receive letters from my constituents every day about the urgency of what we are doing today And I have to say that like it or not I cannot get through the pile of letters without crying tears for real Its very very difficult to think about the small businesses laidoff individuals individuals worrying about their jobs what theyre going through in my district and the urgency with which they view the actions that we are about to take today and the importance of moving on from this rule and getting to the actual debate I want to read one of them that is in front of me here before I yield a little time to my colleague from California This one says My housemate and I were both laid off me in September 08 and she in February 09 We have applied diligently for work in and around Portland with no luck We had to cash in our meager 401ks and have been very thankful for the COBRA subsidy so that we could afford insurance during this most harsh of times But our money is running out fast As you know the subsidy is about to expire and we cannot afford the huge jump in premium We cannot afford both the mortgage and the insurance We cannot afford our prescriptions and our health care will be at stake as if things werent bad enough We will lose our home PLEASE help push through the COBRA extension and continuation of the ARRA COBRA subsidy It is an immediate fix for so many families who will surely gain employment over the next 6 months now that the economy has finally taken an upswing Madam Speaker those are the things that make us all cry real tears and make us want to pass this rule and go on to passing this legislation today Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California Mr Garamendi Madam Speaker the legislation we are considering today is about investing in jobs It is about investing in infrastructure and it is about rebalancing our economy So its not just the big banks and Wall Street firms that benefit from an economic recovery This bill is about helping the American family This week a New York TimesCBS News poll surveyed unemployed Americans Not surprisingly they found that being unemployed takes a toll far beyond what can be measured in dollars and cents Half of the people surveyed said they had begun to suffer from depression and anxiety half said the recession has caused them to make major life changes and nearly half said they have seen changes in their childrens behavior that they know is a result of their difficult financial situation We are not just helping men and women whove lost their job who have suffered from uncertainty emotional pain and indignation but we are helping their families We are helping their children It is time for us to invest in the jobs and policies that will get the American Dream back on track and restore the promise of opportunity and prosperity for everyone I urge a yes vote on the previous question and on the rule The material previously referred to by Ms Foxx is as follows Amendment to H Res 976 Offered by Ms Foxx At the end of the resolution insert the following new section Sec 32 On the third legislative day after the adoption of this resolution immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV and without intervention of any point of order the House shall proceed to the consideration of the resolution II Res 554 amending the Rules of the House of Representatives to require that legislation and conference reports be available on the Internet for 72 hours before consideration by the House and for other purposes The resolution shall be considered as read The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and any amendment thereto to final adoption without intervening motion or demand for division of the question except 1 one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Rules 2 an amendment if offered by the Minority Leader or his designee and if printed in that portion of the Congressional Record designated for that purpose in clause 8 of rule XVIII at least one legislative day prior to its consideration which shall be in order without intervention of any point of order or demand for division of the question shall be considered as read and shall be separately debatable for twenty minutes equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent and 3 one motion to recommit which shall not contain instructions Clause 1c of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of House Resolution 554 The information contained herein was provided by Democratic Minority on multiple occasions throughout the 109th Congress The Vote on the Previous Question What It Really Means This vote the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule is not merely a procedural vote A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow the opposition at least for the moment to offer an alternative plan It is a vote about what the House should be debating Mr Clarence Cannons Precedents of the House of Representatives VI 308311 describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House Cannon cites the Speakers ruling of January 13 1920 to the effect that the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition in order to offer an amendment On March 15 1909 a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry asking who was entitled to recognition Speaker Joseph G Cannon RIllinois said The previous question having been refused the gentleman from New York Mr Fitzgerald who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment is entitled to the first recognition Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic majority they will say the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution and has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever But that is not what they have always said Listen to the definition of the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress page 56 Heres how the Rules Committee described the rule using information form Congressional Quarterlys American Congressional Dictionary If the previous question is defeated control of debate shifts to the leading opposition member usually the minority Floor Manager who then manages an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the pending business Deschlers Procedure in the US House of Representatives the subchapter titled Amending Special Rules states a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules opens the resolution to amendment and further debate Chapter 21 section 212 Section 213 continues Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon Clearly the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Democratic majoritys agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan I yield back the balance of my time and move the previous question on the resolution 
H_MA_MCGOVERN,2009-12-16,1997_2009,0170, Madam Speaker I rise in support of this rule and specifically I rise in support of the Jobs for Main Street Act which we made in order under this rule This important bill will provide the following 48 billion for highways transit and other infrastructure projects 27 billion to hire teachers police firefighters and for other job training programs Thats 75 billion for jobcreating programs that are proven successes and that will help put Americans back to work On top of that the Jobs for Main Street Act provides 79 billion in emergency relief funding that will go to critical safety net programs like unemployment benefits health insurance for unemployed workers Federal matching funds for Medicaid and funding for the child tax credit All told Madam Speaker the Jobs for Main Street Act is a good bill one that will build on the success of the Recovery Act which was signed into law earlier this year and which is one that will put people back to work We know that these are difficult economic times and we recognize that the American public is hurting With the Jobs for Main Street Act we will continue to stimulate the economy to shrink the unemployment rate and more importantly to create new jobs Ten months after President Obama signed the Recovery Act into law we are seeing real results across the country According to the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee real jobs are being created by the Recovery Act and we are seeing the impact of these jobs in the unemployment figures Look at the results Because of the Recovery Act we have seen the creation of almost 630000 direct and indirect jobs in the transportation industry alone Thats 210000 direct hires alone The result of these direct hires is a 11 billion payroll It is 179 million in unemployment compensation not spent It is peoples insurance restored health insurance restored and it is 230 million in paid Federal taxes Additional jobs have been created because of the clean water and highspeed rail projects All told the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee estimates that the Recovery Act has created or has sustained approximately 857000 jobs All of this underscores the importance of public infrastructure programs These arent projects just for the safety and wellbeing of our friends and neighbors they are also projects that put these friends and neighbors back to work Madam Speaker this Congress is acting This House will pass the Jobs for Main Street Act and even more jobs will be created Earlier this year my Republican friends chose politics over the needs of the American people and every single one of them opposed the Recovery and Reinvestment Act They liked the same old same old Well that was their way of thinking Thats the old way of thinking That way of thinking took Bill Clintons accomplishments in creating a record number of jobs and eliminating our deficits and paying down the debt and turned it into George Bushs recession a recession that cost millions of Americans jobs a recession that added billions and billions to our debt and added that debt on the backs of our children and our grandchildren Madam Speaker people in this country want us to act People want us to create jobs and thats what we are going to do

Senator from Minnesota is recognized Madam President how much time does our side have The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore There is 17 minutes 15 seconds remaining The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Michigan I want to hear about the amendment and continue our conversation I ask unanimous consent she be extended an additional 2 minutes No I withdraw that request The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Without objection it is so ordered Health care reform is a mustdo womans issue and health insurance reform is a mustchange issue So many of the women and men of the Senate are here today to fight for change and to make sure we have universal access to health care When we have universal access it makes a difference in our lives which means we have to have universal access to preventive and screening services My amendmentand by the way it is a bipartisan amendmentmakes universal access to preventive and screening services for women available There is much discussion about whether women should get a particular service at a particular age We dont mandate that women get a service we leave that up to a decision made with the woman and her doctor But first of all they need to be able to have a doctor So we are for universal access and this is why the underlying bill is so important Then when you have that there should also be universal access to preventive and screening services particularly to the top killers of women those things that are unique to women We think about cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer and cervical cancer Also women are dying at an increased rate of lung cancer Then there are these other silent killers that have had a lethal effect on women and that is cardio and vascular disease So we want to guarantee universal access to medically appropriate or medically necessary screening and preventive services Many women dont get these services because first of all they dont have health insurance and No 2 when they do have it it means these services are either not available unless they are mandated by States or the copayments are so high that they avoid getting them in the first place The second important point about my amendment is it eliminates deductibles and copayments So we eliminate two big hurdles having insurance in the first place which is the underlying bill as well as copayments and deductibles I know of no one in this room who would not want to be on our side on this issue I wish to acknowledge the role the Senator from Alaska has played Ms Murkowski as well as Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison Senator Snowe and Senator Collins We the women of the Senate have worked on a bipartisan basis for years making sure we were included in the protocols at NIH increasing funding for important research areas to find that cure to race for that cure and at the same time to be able to have mammogram standards What the Murkowski amendmentand by the way she is Murkowski I am Mikulski We sound alike and the amendments might sound alike but boy are they different The Murkowski amendment offers information I think that is important That is a threshold matter You have to have information to make an informed decision But it does not guarantee universal access to these services and of course it does not eliminate the high payments and deductibles So her amendment is flawed My amendment is terrific My amendment offers key preventive services including an annual womens health screening that would go to a comprehensive assessment of the dangers to women including heart disease and diabetes We hope when the Senate makes its decision today it deals with the fact that for we women the insurance companies take simply being a woman as a preexisting condition We face so many issues and hurdles We cant get health care We cant get health insurance because of preexisting conditions called a Csection I am going to be meeting with an insurance company executive later where his company denied health insurance to a woman who had a medically mandated Csection and a letter from this insurance company said We are not going to give you insurance unless you have a sterilizationa coerced sterilization in the United States of America That is going to be an amendment for another day But I just wish to give the flavor and the power of what women face when we have to cope with the insurance companies or where there are barriers to our getting these health care screening services So we want to be able to save lives and we want to be able to save money We believe in universal access and if you utilize the service it is because you have had the consultation with your doctor We do know early screening and detection does save lives and at the same time it saves money I will conclude with this When we look at heart disease and diabetes not only cancer but early detection of diabetes means in a wellmanaged program under appropriate medical supervision you very likely will not lose that eye you will not lose that kidney you will not lose that leg and most of all you will not lose your life So lets not lose the Mikulski amendment Lets go with Mikulski and thank Murkowski for her information but hers is too tepid and too limited Madam President I ask my colleague one of the great guys who supports us Senator Cardin how much time he needs I yield 5 minutes to Senator Cardin Madam President I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from the State of Washington who has been a real leader on these issues By the way Madam President before the Senator speaks I want to thank Senator Stabenow for a unique courtesy This is her desk and as many of my colleagues know I broke my ankle and I cant get up to where my desk is at this point I will however in a matter of another few weeks But she has given me this desk on loan so that I could stand on my own two feet to debate this amendment and I wanted to thank her for the courtesy Madam President I also want to note something while the senior Senator from the Republican leadership is here and the author of the amendment We the women of the Senate on a bipartisan basis have worked for womens health Today we disagree on what is the best way to achieve it by these two amendments I want to thank my colleagues for setting a tone of civility I think this has been one of the most rational civilized conversations we have had over this and I would like to thank them As the leader on this side of the aisle in terms of seniority I would like to extend my hand in friendship and suggest when this bill is done and this amendment is done we continue to focus on this wonderful work that we have done together We have done things that have saved millions of lives and so I look forward to continuing that Madam President I now yield 4 minutes to the Senator from the State of Washington Mrs Murray The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Washington This amendment does not cover abortion Abortion has never been defined as a preventive service This amendment is strictly concerned with ensuring that women get the kind of preventive screenings and treatments they may need to prevent diseases particular to women such as breast cancer and cervical cancer There is neither legislative intent nor legislative language that would cover abortion under this amendment nor would abortion coverage be mandated in any way by the Secretary of Health and Human Services President we are waiting for Senator Boxer to come to the floor so if the other side of the aisle has another speaker I know at the end we hope that Senator Lisa and Senator BarbI say that because our last names sound so much the samecould wrap it up How would the Senator from Wyoming like to proceed We are waiting for Senator Boxer or for Senator Baucus Whatever way it will work and accommodate you while we are waiting to see who our speakers are President I fear the microphone of the Senator from Alaska is not working President how much time is there on our side As we get ready to conclude the debate on both the Mikulski as in Barbara Mikulski and Murkowski as in Lisa Murkowski amendments I want to first say a word about the Senator from Alaska We have worked together on the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee We have worked together as women of the Senate to provide access to womens health services Not too long ago when I had my awful fall she gave me much wisdom and counsel and practical tips because she herself had broken her ankle To us when you say to Senator Lisa or Senator Barb Break a leg it has a whole different meaning I again thank her for all her work I have great respect for her I look forward to our continued working together But I do sincerely disagree with her amendment because what her amendment does is it guarantees really only information It does not guarantee universal access to preventive and screening services It also does not remove the cost barriers by eliminating the high deductibles for the copayments when you go to get a preventative or screening service It tells insurance companies to give information on recommended preventative care That is a good thing but it is a threshold thing You need to have universal access to the service In addition we do not mandate that you have the service we mandate that you have access to the service The decision as to whether you should get it will be a private one unique to you We leave it to personalized medicine So in the poignant case of the wife of the Senator from Wyoming it would have been up to the doctor the physician to get her the service she needed It is not only I or one side of the aisle that is opposing the Murkowski amendment The American Cancer Society the American Heart Association and the American academy of GYN services oppose it My amendment is a superior amendment because it guarantees universal access to preventative and screening services It also eliminates one of the major barriers to accessing care by getting rid of high payments and deductibles It doesnt say you will have a mammogram at 40 because again we are substituting ourselves for the task force it says you will have universal access to that mammogram if you and your doctor decide it is medically necessary or medically appropriate Vote for Mikulski Dont vote for Murkowski And please on this one get it straight President I rise in opposition to the Lisa Murkowski amendment Though wellintentioned it does not guarantee universal access to preventive and screening services for women It does not remove the cost barriers of high payments and codeductibles It is opposed by the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association It primarily provides information on those matters We salute her intention but we think her amendment is too limited and to quote the American Heart Association it would be an actual step backwards in the area of making preventive services available particularly not only in the matter of cancer but in heart and vascular diseasethe emerging No 1 killer for women I urge defeat of the Murkowski amendment 
S_MN_FRANKEN,2009-12-03,2009_2009,0022, Madam President I rise to express my support for Senator Mikulskis amendment for womens health This amendment is crucial because it is about prevention Prevention is one of the key ways this bill will transform our system of sick care into true health care It is common sense You get the right screenings at the right time so you find diseases earlier It saves lives and it saves money The Senate bill already has several provisions for preventive care which I strongly support For example colonoscopies and screening for heart disease will be covered at no cost It is a good start The current bill relies solely on the US Preventive Services Task Force to determine which services will be covered at no cost The problem is several crucial womens health services are omitted Senator Mikulskis amendment closes this gap Under her amendment the Health Resources and Services Administration will be able to include other important services at no cost such as the well woman visit prenatal care and family planning These preventive services will truly improve womens health For example if all women got the recommended screening for cervical cancer we could detect this disease earlier and prevent four out of every five cases of this invasive cancer This will improve the health of our mothers sisters and our daughters This bill and this amendment will make prevention a priority and not an afterthought Although I respect the efforts of my distinguished colleague from Alaska the Murkowski alternative falls short The Murkowski amendment does nothing to guarantee women will have improved access to coverage and costsharing protections for preventive services Rather than establish objective scientific standards about which preventive services should be covered this alternative only requires insurers to consult with medical organizations when making coverage decisions While we know the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations do not cover all necessary services the Murkowski amendment entirely removes even this basic coverage requirement from the bill leaving women without any protections under health care reform for essential preventive care This means that important preventive care for women including screening for osteoporosis and sexually transmitted infections may not be covered by insurance plans In the simplest terms the Murkowski amendment maintains the status quo and we know the status quo is not working for millions of women who are forgoing preventive care because they simply cannot afford it The Murkowski amendment continues to leave prevention coverage decisions up to health insurance companies and that means there would be no guarantee that any health plan will cover basic preventive services at all Do we want to leave these important decisions up to the insurance companies The health of American women is too important to leave in their hands That is why I urge my colleagues to support Senator Mikulskis amendment and vote to make sure women can get the preventive screenings they need to stay healthy Most important this amendment will make sure women have access to these lifesaving screenings at no cost The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senators time has expired The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Without objection it is so ordered Madam President prevention is just one of the ways this bill will improve womens health It also ends insurance companies practice of charging women more because they happen to be women or denying coverage based on a history of pregnancy Csection or domestic violence We need to pass this bill this year to ensure comprehensive affordable care for women throughout the country And we need to include this amendment because I want to be able to look my wife in the eye I want to be able to look my daughter in the eyemy son tooand my future grandchildren in the eye and say we did everything we could in this bill to improve womens health We cannot wait any longer I urge all my colleagues to stand with us and support this amendment I yield the floor

yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Texas Madam President I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Florida The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Florida Mr LeMIEUX Madam President I come to the floor today to draw back the curtain a little I hope and to widen the lens to talk about the issue of the bill before us not just on this particular amendment but on what it is going to mean for my constituents in Florida and for the people of this country I had the opportunity last week to be back home in Florida in south Florida in Palm Beach County and Broward County and MiamiDade County where I talked to doctors hospital administrators folks who run Medicare Advantage plans as well as everyday Floridians specifically senior citizens The responses I heard were nearly unanimous and that was grave concern about the bill that is being debated on this floor and a general confusion as to why the Congress is pursuing the path that it is The people of Florida do not understand why we are going to cut Medicare to create a new program The people of Florida do not understand why we are going to raise taxes to create a new program The people whom I have spoken to in Florida do not understand why we would undertake a new 25 trillion health care proposal if it was not going to reduce the cost of health insurance for the 170 million to 180 million Americans who have health insurance today Why are we embarking upon this measure if it is not going to affect most everyday Floridians and everyday Americans who are struggling under the high cost of health insurance Health insurance premiums have increased 130 percent in the past 10 years When the President put this proposal forward and when he campaigned on it he said his major goal was to reduce the cost of health insurance When he addressed the Nation in a joint session of Congress on September 9 he said his plan would reduce the cost of health insurance But we find out that for at least 32 million Americans it will raise the cost of health insurance 10 to 13 percent So at least half of the goal if not most of the goal of his plan for most Americans in this country will not be accomplished Yet we are going to cut nearly 12 trillion out of Medicare we are going to raise taxes by 12 trillion and we are going to spend 25 trillion on this program which was admitted to by Senator Baucus yesterday on the floor which cannot be under my understanding in any way budget neutral But I want to speak specifically about the cuts to Medicare It cuts 192 billion according to the Congressional Budget Office to Medicares payment rates for most services I think we have to be clear here that if you cut providers you are going to cut services The very reason we talked about increasing doctor payments in that 1 4 trillion program was so that patients would not receive fewer services so there would be ample doctors providing services for Medicare It is beyond logic to argue that cutting providers will not cut services What will happen when we cut providers doctors nursing homes home health agencies hospitals Fewer and fewer of them will provide benefits and fewer and fewer of them will take Medicare The Chief Actuary of CMS believes the cuts in the bill we have before us could cause providers to end their participation in Medicare providers for whom Medicare constitutes a substantive portion of their business could find it difficult to remain profitable and might end their participation in the program Every American understands this If we pay less money to health care providers they are going to offer less benefits or more and more they are not going to participate in Medicare The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission found in June of last year that 29 percent of Medicare beneficiaries who were looking for a primary care doctor had a problem finding one to treat them This is of grave concern to the 3 million Floridians who are on Medicare If a doctor will not see them what kind of health care plan is this These seniors our greatest generation have paid into this program their whole life It is illusory if they cant find a doctor who will treat them One of my constituents Earl Bean from Sanford FL recently told CNN that he called about 15 doctors when he was trying to find health care and he was told they were not taking new Medicare patients So when we cut 12 trillion out of Medicare is that going to improve health care for seniors or is it going to continue to decline health care for seniors You cant get blood from a stone It is going to make the situation worse For anyone to come to this floor and say that it would not is incredible We have in Florida the second highest Medicare population When we cut 135 billion from hospitals and 21 billion from the disproportionate share fund which is basically money that goes to these hospitals to provide health care for seniors and the indigent how are they going to be able to provide that health care I spoke to the administrator of the North Broward Hospital District and told him about this cut to the DSH funds and he told me it would be devastating to their provision of health care Then we are going to take a very popular program called Medicare Advantagemore than 900000 Floridians in my Stateand we are going to cut it as well I recently visited the Leon Medical Center and their new facility in Miami Dade County where they provide stateoftheart firstclass health care for seniors not only normal health care but eyeglasses hearing aids dental care and the constituents who go there love it They are getting the kind of health care that you would hope your senior citizens in your family would get The principal of the company Ben Leon told me they have saved 70 billion in the way they have run their system He told me if we continue on this path with these cuts to Medicare Advantage he will not be able to provide these good services going forward There are some fixes to grandfather folks in but all in all people will be cut and all in all the program will not be as good and it will decline the health care of seniors in Florida and across this country We will cut 15 billion from nursing home care and 40 billion from home health agencies I spoke to a provider of a home health agency practice in Florida He said these cuts will put half of the home health care agency folks out of business At a time when we have 112 percent unemployment in Florida this health care bill is going to cost people their jobs and it is going to decline the quality of health care I am also concerned about this Medicare advisory board This independent board of nonelected folks is going to have the power to cut Medicare by 23 billion over the next 10 years and it will be up to this body to reinstate those cuts These people are not elected my constituents in Florida dont know who they are but they are going to be responsible for the decline of their Medicare and their health care The greatest generation who fought to protect this country is looking at this health care bill and wondering why Folks with health insurance in this countrymore than 170 million who are not going to see their health care costs go down but upare wondering why Americans who are seeing higher taxes and penalties for not buying these health insurance programs under this bill are wondering why If we are here to reform health careand we should beif we are here to try to make sure the 45 million people in this country and the nearly 4 million Floridians get health insuranceand we should be then why dont we take a stepbystep approach I am new to this body My first day here was September 10 so I have not even been here 3 months But I can tell my colleagues the American people if they knew what I know now and could see what I see would be baffled by this process There is not a giveandtake on this issue We didnt all sit down together in a conference room and work this out to have a bipartisan bill The Democratic leader worked on it with his colleagues but not with us So now we have a program that cuts Medicare that raises taxes that doesnt decrease the cost of health care for the majority of Americans and will cost us 25 trillion and cant be budgetneutral at a time when we have a 12 trillion debt a debt that requires each of useach familyto put 100000 on our shoulders to be responsible for that debt a debt where the third largest payment in our budget is for interest payments and over the next 10 years those interest payments will go up by 500 billion enough to pay for many of the budgets of the Federal Government The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator has used his 10 minutes Mr LeMIEUX Including the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq I thank the Chair and I yield the floor The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Maryland is recognized Madam President I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from South Dakota The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from South Dakota is recognized I appreciate the comments some of which need correction from yesterday and those that have just been made On a partisan bill I sat through all of those days in the HELP Committee That bill was rushed and put together Senator Kennedy was not able to be involved in that part of it His staff did it They did it in a hurry We turned in 159 amendments that were accepted Most of those were for typos and minor corrections There were a few that actually had some substance to them That bill was passed on July 15 out of committee without a single Republican vote It wasnt published We didnt see the final version until September 17 The ones that were really something that could have made a difference were taken out without the permission of any Republican Senator That is not bipartisan We talked about how many hours we spent together If you dont accept things from the minority party it is not bipartisan It is still partisan Just spending hours doesnt make any difference To move on to a different topic yesterday we were talking about costs I hope the people take a look at a Wall Street Journal article from yesterday that says A bill that raises prices but lowers costs and other miracles We heard all day yesterday that this bill is going to save people a lot of money This article reads We have now reached the stage of the healthcare debate when all that matters is getting a bill passed so all news is good news more subsidies mean lower deficits and more expensive insurance is really cheaper insurance The nonpolitical mind reels Consider how Washington received the Congressional Budget Offices study Monday of how Harry Reids Senate bill will affect insurance costs which by any rational measure ought to have been a disaster for the bill CBO found that premiums in the individual market will rise by 10 to 13 more than if Congress did nothing Family policies under the status quo are projected to cost 13100 on average but under ObamaCare will jump to 15200 Fabulous news No Big Cost Rise in US Premiums Is Seen in Study said the New York Times while the Washington Post declared Senate Health Bill Gets a Boost The White House crowed that the CBO report was more good news about what reform will mean for families struggling to keep up with skyrocketing premiums under the broken status quo Finance Chairman Max Baucus chimed in from the Senate floor that Healthcare reform is fundamentally about lower healthcare costs Lowering costs is what healthcare reform is designed to do lowering costs and it will achieve this objective Except it wont CBO says it expects employersponsored insurance costs to remain roughly in line with the status quo yet even this is a failure by Mr Baucuss and the White Houses own standards Meanwhile fixing the individual marketwhich is expensive and unstable largely because it does not enjoy the favorable tax treatment given to jobbased coveragewas supposed to be the whole purpose of reform Instead CBO is confirming that new coverage mandates will drive premiums higher But Democrats are declaring victory claiming that these higher insurance prices dont count because they will be offset by new government subsidies About 57 of the people who buy insurance through the bills new exchanges that will supplant todays individual market will qualify for subsidies that cover about twothirds of the total premium So the bill will increase costs but it will then disguise those costs by transferring them to taxpayers from individuals Higher costs can be conjured away because theyre suddenly on the government balance sheet The Reid bills 3719 billion in new health taxes are also apparently not a new cost because they can be passed along to consumers or perhaps will be hidden in lost wages This is the paleo liberal school of bruteforce wealth redistribution and a very long way from the repeated White House claims that reform is all about bending the cost curve The only thing being bent here is the budget truth Moreover CBO is almost certainly underestimating the cost increases Based on its countybycounty actuarial data the insurer WellPoint has calculated that Mr Baucuss bill would cause some premiums to triple in the individual market The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association came to similar conclusions One reason is community rating which forces insurers to charge nearly uniform rates regardless of customer health status or habits CBO doesnt think this will have much of an effect but costs inevitably rise when insurers arent allowed to price based on risk This is why today some 35 states impose no limits on premium variation and six allow wide differences among consumers The White House decided to shoot messengers like WellPoint to avoid rebutting their message But Amanda Kowalski of MIT William Congdon of the Brookings Institution and Mark Showalter of Brigham Young have found similar results In a 2008 paper in the peerreviewed Forum for Health Economics and Policy these economists found that state community rating laws raise premiums in the individual market by 209 to 331 for families and 102 to 171 for singles In New Jersey which also requires insurers to accept all comers socalled guaranteed issue premiums increased by as much as 227 The political tragedy is that there are plenty of reform alternatives that really would reduce the cost of insurance According to CBO the relatively modest House GOP bill would actually reduce premiums by 5 to 8 in the individual market in 2016 and by 7 to 10 for small businesses The GOP reforms would also do so without imposing huge new taxes But Democrats dont care because their bill isnt really about lowering costs Its about putting Washington in charge of health insurance at any cost The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The time of the Senator has expired Under the previous order the time until 1145 am shall be equally divided between the Senator from Maryland Ms Mikulski and the Republican leader or his designee That was an editorial by the Wall Street Journal the staff of the Wall Street Journal confirmed by MIT Brigham Young and others Madam President I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Kansas President I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Alaska so she can actually propose her amendment that we have been debating and take up to 10 minutes If it does leave us with 2 minutes then I would have the Senator from Wyoming use that 2 minutes President I wish to raise a point as the accountant around here You have mentioned some ways to cut Medicare to pay for this Actually there are only two ways you can pay for a government program You have to do it through cuts or through taxes I dont think there is anybody in America who believes you can do 1 trillion worth of new programs and have them all paid for unless you steal somewhere That is what we are doing from Medicare We say that is not going to affect Medicare If you eliminate the DSH payments which are part of this it is going to put some Wyoming hospitals out of business I can assure you that if those seniors cant go to a hospital in their town they are going to consider that a benefit cut They are going to be upset and they ought to be The same with nursing homes If you cut back on nursing homes the people who have to move to another town for a nursing homebecause all of our towns dont have more than one nursing homeputs quite a burden not only on the patient who isnt going to get to see their family as much but also on the family who has to travel a long way to see the patient So I dont think we ought to be paying for the new programs by doing this when Medicare needs an extended life I am always fascinated when they explain that this will extend the life of Medicare because yes if you cut payments to everybody that maybe saves money and extends the life of it if we did that Is there anybody who thinks we are going to cut the doctors over the next 10 years by 250 billion No we are not going to do that We never have President I wish to ask the Senator from Idaho what he thinks will happen with these Medicare cuts as they affect jobs and the economy That is one of the biggest things on peoples minds right now jobs and the economy We are concentrating on something here where we are going to maybe make a difference even though CBO says it wont be much of a difference 
S_OK_COBURN,2009-12-03,2005_2009; 2005_2009; 2005_2009; 2005_2009; 2005_2009; 2005_2009; 2005_2009; 2005_2009; 2005_2009,0349; 0350; 0351; 0352; 0353; 0354; 0355; 0356; 0357, Madam President it is interesting as a practicing physician who has actually cared for women and nobody so far who has been in on this debate has ever done I congratulate the Senator from Maryland for her care about prevention because we all know that is key The mischaracterization we heard about this bill is astounding The reason we got in trouble with the Preventive Task Force is because it did something that was inappropriate and did not have the appropriate professional groups on its task force when it made its recommendation on breast cancer screening The Murkowski amendment says we will rely on the professional societies to make the determinations of what must be available We have heard the Senator from Iowa say health insurance will decide that That is absolutely untrue Health insurance will not decide it The professional societies will decide what will be covered and the insurance companies must cover it under the Murkowski amendment The second point is there will not be any objective criteria The objective criteria doctors practice under today are the guidelines of their professional societies Here is the difference between the Murkowski amendment and the Mikulski amendment The Senator from Maryland relies on the government to make the decision on what will be covered She refers to the Health Resources and Services Administration She refers to the Health Resources and Services Administration which has no guidelines whatsoever on womens health care right now other than prenatal care and childcare That is the only thing they have For whom does HRSA work HRSA works for the Secretary of Health and Human Services So the contrast between these two amendments could not be any more clear in terms of do we want to solve the problems we just experienced on mammogram recommendations We can let the government decide which got us into this trouble and they will set the practice guidelines and recommendations for screening or you can let the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or the American College of Surgeons or the American College of Oncologists set and use their guidelines The choice is simple The government can decide what care you get or the people who do the care the professionals who know what is needed who write the peerreviewed articles who study the literature and make the recommendations for their guidelines Every month I get from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists their new guidelines I try to follow them at every instance The fact is the Mikulski amendment says government will decide That is what it says The government will decide through HRSA The Murkowski amendment says it is the best practices known by the physicians who are out there practicing What is the difference How does it apply to you as a woman It applies to you as a woman because the people who know best get to make the recommendations rather than a government bureaucracy That is the difference If you will recall under the stimulus bill we passed we have a cost comparative effectiveness panel which will surely be in the mix associated with the recommendations If you look at what the task force on preventive recommendations said from a cost standpoint they were absolutely right From a patient standpoint they were absolutely wrong The real debate on this billthe Mikulski amendment is the start of the real debateis do we have the government decide based on cost or do we have the professional caregivers who know the field decide based on what is best for that patient That is the difference What the Senator from Alaska does which is necessary is she says we will rely on the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology We will rely on the American College of Surgeons We will rely on the American College of Oncologists to determine what should be the screening recommendations for patients For you see what happens with the Mikulski amendment is the government stands between you and your doctor That is what is coming That is what will be there There is no choice under the Murkowski amendment for an insurance company to have the option either to cover or not to cover They must It says shall do that So the mischaracterizations on what the Murkowski amendment actually says and does are unfortunate The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senators time has expired The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Who yields time The Senator from Maryland President the chart behind me shows the cuts in Medicare that are in this bill We have heard all sorts of arguments I have a few rhetorical questions for my colleagues and my friend the President of the United States There is no question Medicare Advantage costs too much I have agreed to that with the chairman of the Finance Committee But you cannot say that coordinated care does not improve the care of seniors and that is going to be cut You cannot say that eyeglasses and hearing aids are not going to be cut and they do improve the care You cannot say to seniors who cannot afford a supplemental policy who have Medicare Advantage they are not going to lose some of their care They are In fact 26 million according to the Congressional Budget Office are going to lose that very carenot some of it all of it They are going to lose that advantage under this legislation The answer to the question will this impact seniors care is yes We have heard these cuts arent going to impact anybody or the only people they are going to impact are the insurance companies Well I am all for impacting the insurance companies but I dont want to impact patients negatively So we have cuts to Medicare including hospitals of 1347 billion hospices 77 billion nursing homes 146 billion Medicare Advantage 120 billion home health agencies 421 billion and then you say you are not going to do anything to impact the care of seniors My colleague from Iowa whom I love disputed my statement about the fact that the life expectancy is going to go down under this bill He has never practiced medicine a day in his life I know what goes on inside hospitals When you cut 130 billion out of the hospitals the time you are going to wait for me the time you wait after you push your call button is going to get extended and the complications from that are going to result in decreased quality of care and shortened life expectancies There is no question about it So we can play the game but the real thing Americans ought to know is almost 500 billion of spending on Medicare patients today is going to go by the wayside to be spent on a new entitlement on a brandnew entitlement The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Brown The Senator from Idaho is recognized There is no question to answer my colleague from Idaho that if it doesnt eliminate the ability it will deny by delaying the ability Care delayed is care denied All you have to do is read all of the tragedies that have gone on in this country for people who have delayed care which has resulted in large complications for that individual Would the Senator yield for a moment My one criticism of my colleagues in writing this bill is I think there is money we can save in Medicare It is called waste fraud and abuse A Harvard professor who studies this says there is at least 125 billion a year in fraud We have had several studies that say it is anywhere from 100 billion to 175 billion a year There is nothing in this bill to eliminate fraud What we are doing is we are taking care from seniors instead of taking the money from the fraudulent actors in the health care system We are in trouble in Medicare in this Nation Everybody knows it We have made promises The unfunded liability on Medicare is 79 trillion For us to take 12 trillion no matter what the Enron accounting says afterward the fact is we are going to reduce that we are going to make that worse We may not make it worse next year or the year after but we are going to make it worse It is going to be worse for seniors but it is also as the Senator from Tennessee said going to be extremely worse for the seniors kids and grandkids Not only have we done that we have raised the taxes in Medicare on a certain group of people and we are going to take that money and not put it in Medicare we are going to take that money a Medicare tax and create a new entitlement So the Senator from Florida is absolutely right If you vote against the MCCain motion you are saying you want to cut 12 trillion out of Medicare and that it will have no effect whatsoever on the care I remind the Senator from Florida there are 1 million people on Medicare Advantage in the State of Florida 1 million people who are going to lose benefits under this bill One million people in the State of Florida will lose benefits under this bill I dont know that to be factual as of yet What I do know is we are going to have 44 million baby boomers in the next 12 years jump into Medicare and we are cutting Medicare We are going to have 44 million baby boomers jump into Medicare I am one of them We are going to cut the amount of available funds from Medicare under this bill Does 60 Plus sell supplemental insurance policies to seniors I wonder why people want seniors off Medicare Advantage 
S_MI_STABENOW,2009-12-03,2001_2009,0101, Madam President first I thank Senator Mikulski for her leadership not only on this important amendment but on so many issues in health care issues for women across this country We are honored to call her dean for all of us as it relates to focusing on the issues that are so critical to women and their families I thank Senator Reid for making this a priority and making this the first amendment we are offering in this debate We all know that often women are the ones making health care decisions for their families as well as themselves They are more likely to be the person making health insurance choices Women of childbearing age pay on average 68 percent more for their health care than men do We have so many instances in which insurance companies are standing between women and their doctors right now in making decisionsdecisions not to cover preventive services such as a mammogram screening or a cervical cancer screening decisions to call pregnancy a preexisting condition so women cannot get health insurance decisions not to cover maternity care so that women and their babies can get the care they need so that babies can be successful in life both prenatal care and postnatal care Women of this country have a tremendous stake in health care reform We pay more now if we can find coverage at all and there are too many ways in which insurance companies block women from getting the basic health services they need This amendment is critically important to make sure that women are able to get preventive care services without a deductible and without copays This amendment recognizes the unique health needs of women It requires coverage of womens preventive services developed by womens health experts to meet the unique needs of women Why do we stress that We stress that because for years we have struggled in so many areas to make sure that womens health needs were focused on and not just health in general When we look at research through the National Institutes of Health and what it took to get to a place where research would be done for women on womens subjects or on female mice or rats rather than male subjects to make sure that the differences between men and women were considered in research we have made important steps in that direction Again Senator Mikulski was leading the way as it relates to having a womens health research effort in our country This is one more step to make sure we are covering womens preventive services developed by womens health experts for the unique needs of women That is what this is all aboutmaking sure women have access to preventive services such as cervical cancer screenings osteoporosis screenings annual mammograms for women under 50 pregnancy and post partum screenings domestic violence screenings and annual checkups for women We know more women die of heart disease than actually any other disease This is something I do not think is widely known We have even heard that many physicians do not realize the extent to which heart disease is prevalent in women All of us women have worked together on a womens heart bill and part of that is for screenings Part of that is to make sure we are screening for heart disease and strokes the No 1 killer of women This would make sure those screenings would be part of health care reform I could go on to list all the different prevention items but I will simply say that when we are talking about womens health and we are talking about womens lives this is an incredibly important amendment to adopt The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senators time has expired 
S_TX_HUTCHISON,2009-12-03,1993_2009,0101, Madam President I rise to speak on the Mikulski amendment and the Murkowski amendment because I feel very passionate about womens issues In fact Senator Mikulski and I have worked throughout my time in the Senate and her time before me on these very issuesassuring that womens health care concerns which are different from mens in many instances are a part of any health care coverage in our country and ongoing we must assure the same I have been an advocate for cancer screening services for women and I was dismayed when I saw the US Preventive Services Task Force a few weeks ago issuing new guidelines for cancer screening for womenbreast cancer screening for women We have all lived with breast cancer throughout the course of the history of women but especially in the last probably 25 years the strides that we have made in saving lives and in the survivability of women with breast cancer is because we have had early detection We dont have a cure for breast cancer and we are all fighting for that cure but until we get it the first line of defense is early detection So now we have a new task force recommendation that says everything we have had and enjoyed over the last 25 years in saving womens lives is no longer relevant because now before the age of 50 you dont need a mammogram and after the age of 50 it is every other year Well I know Senator Mikulski and I agree we do not think that is right Neither did any other woman in the Senate when that was proposed years ago by President Clinton We all stood up and said no I am standing up and I am saying no once again and I am sure every woman in the Senate is as many women in America are But the Mikulski amendment doesnt actually fully address the problem of having the task forcewhich is relied on 14 times in the bill before usas the arbiter of what is necessary for our government program and that it then will surely become the private sector standard as well That task force even has money allocated to advertize its task force recommendations So rather than the Mikulski amendment severing the ties with the task force the amendment now has another government agency that has the same capability to basically interfere between the woman and her doctor which is where we want the decisions to be made Coverage decisions will be dictated by both the task force and a new Health Resources and Services Administration entry into the mix While I certainly agree with Senator Mikulski about the importance of preventive services for women and insurance coverage decisions I cant support her amendment because we still have not one but two government task forces and committees that will be in the middle of these health care coverage decisions I think the coverage decisions should be made by doctors and their patients That is why I have joined with Senator Murkowski in offering the alternative approach This is what we should expect from any future health care reform and it is certainly what we expect today The Murkowski amendment will leave the medical decisions to the guidelines established by those who know medical treatment best which is our own doctors In fact we have just received a CBO assessment of what the Murkowski amendment would cost and it actually says there will be a savings So rather than the Mikulski amendment which would spend 1 billion over 10 years the Murkowski amendment would actually save 14 billion over 10 years Why Because the Murkowski amendment relies on the combined commonsense and clinical judgment of American physicians The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senators time has expired So Madam President I urge a vote for the Murkowski amendment I know we have the same goals as Senator Mikulski and her amendment but I dont believe the Mikulski amendment achieves the goal of having a woman and her doctor make the decisions for her That is the key that I think is so important in this debate I urge a vote for the Murkowski amendment I thank the Chair and I yield the floor The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Who yields time 
S_CT_DODD,2009-12-03,1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009;

0401; 0402; 0403, So there is an incentive to trim the cost of the administration of the program It is also true the plans get bonus payments for care coordination and quality and plans can use these bonuses to improve benefits Is it also true that roughly 80 percent of Medicare beneficiaries dont get any of these benefits And that the average Medicare couple over the age of 65 is paying I am told about 90 a year more in Medicare payments for benefits they dont get So here we have 75 to 80 percent of the beneficiaries of Medicare paying more money and not getting the benefits for a program that costs more than 14 percent more and it is a private plan It is a private health care plan Medicare is a public plan Medicare Advantage is not Medicare and it is certainly not an advantage given the overpayments that occurred Our bill does something that I think our friend from Oklahoma Senator Coburn pointed out that is absolutely critical which is that competitive bidding did not exist in the original Who was setting these rates originally during this period of time How did these rates get set Did Congress set them Is it true that if these Medicare Advantage plans come in under the benchmark bid they actually get a piece of the savings Is that correct as well My colleague understands that I hope Medicare Advantage is a private plan You know that of course dont you I assume you know that If my colleague will yield I appreciate what the Senator has just done This is an area where I think there is a lot of confusion and misunderstanding A lot of it begins with just the branding the title of something This was frankly a revelation to me going back a number of weeks ago I heard the words Medicare Advantage I thought this has to be part of the regular Medicare Program because it has that title If my colleague will correct me if I am wrong this is not traditional Medicare this is a private plan right In looking back a few years ago the original reasonand I dont recall the debate as well as my colleague the chairman of the Finance Committee does As I remember the original idea behind this wasand he said this already but it deserves being repeatedthis was a way of cutting costs reducing expenditures In a sense we were sold this idea on the fact that we could do this better more efficiently at far less cost A couple of things happened since then One I think the overpayments on average are around 14 percent If I can reclaim my time 80 percent of older Americans are paying 90 more a year for this Do they have any say in this They dont get any of the benefits Why are they writing a check for 90 a year to pay a private plan from which they get no benefits What about them Dont they deserve something in all this This plan gets subsidized by the American taxpayers That is the only qualification that puts it under the Medicare umbrella because our taxpayers are writing a check to a private company That is why it gets included as part of Medicare Other than that it is a private plan Medicare Advantage decides how to use their extra payments to provide benefits They decide Congress does not There is nothing in the legislation that forces plans to reduce benefits at all rather than reducing profits Medicare Advantage is one of the profitable business lines of the private insurance In fact the New York Times on November 2just about a month agoreported Humana the health insurer posted on Monday a 65 percent jump in thirdquarter profits We are talking about private health care These are profits a 65 percent jump in profits off this plan as bulging membership and premiums from Medicare Advantage overcame a lackluster commercial segment I appreciate the fact that people are getting eyeglasses and things That is wonderful But we need to be clear about this These are not the guaranteed benefits and 80 percent of Medicare beneficiaries get none of these advantages and yet pay more so other people under this private health care planbecause it is subsidized by the American taxpayersget them Again now we are going to put competitive bidding in place Our bill allows under these plans if they follow and do some of the incentives to actually share in some of the profits We are not talking about eliminating all of this plan We are trying to make it work better for people under the bill We have to be honest what we are talking about This is a private insurance company that is subsidized by the American taxpayers It is not what traditionally people think of Medicare What I wish to say and what I wish to ask my colleague There is not a single guaranteed benefit under Medicare that is cut in this bill Not one I defy any Member of this body to identify a guaranteed benefit under Medicare that gets cut You cannot find one Do we cut out gym memberships and things such as that Yes that may happen But on the guaranteed benefitsoperative word is guaranteedunder guaranteed benefits there is not a single cut to a benefit That is why an organization representing 40 million Americans that endorsed the Bush prescription drug plan by the way in 2003hardly a partisan organization as some have suggested todayhas basically opposed the MCCain motion and has endorsed the legislation before us today That organization I say to my good friend would never be endorsing a bill that was going to cut guaranteed benefits under Medicare Let me point out one of the things we have not talked about I say to my friend from Mississippi under our legislation this bill protects seniors in Medicare Advantage from plans that care more about profits than seniors trying to pass the buck Under our bill it allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to kick out any plan under Medicare Advantage that significantly increases their premiums or decreases their benefits Under existing law that would not happen under our bill it does It is not about being hostile to Medicare Advantage It is being realistic about all this and trying to make the tough decisions we have to make about trying to stabilize Medicare seeing to it we are going to have protections in premium reductions and cost savings as well as increasing access and quality All we are trying to point out is when you have a Medicare Advantage plan that has run as poorly as this one has at great cost we now learned14 percent above on average some places it is 50 percent above averagewhere is the equity By the way I say to my friend from Mississippi it is a private health care plan that receives subsidies from the American taxpayers where 80 percent of seniors today pay more and get nothing for it Where is the equity in this There is no equity in this Why should 80 percent of that population pay 90 or more a year on average for a benefit they dont get Where is the equity Madam President I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes Madam President let me say to my colleague again that here we have two organizations representing 43 million seniors in our country and these are organizations that dont just write letters on the fly They have staffs that examine proposals here and that is all they do We have AARP which is an organization that is highly regarded and well recognized representing 40 million seniors in the country and the Commission to Preserve Social Security and Medicare which represents an additional 3 million and that is all they do This is a totally nonpartisan examination These two organizations representing almost 50 million of our seniors have examined this bill in detail every dotted I every semicolon every comma every proposaland have done exhaustive research and they have said This is a good bill This bill is deserving of support We received a letter today from them They are not Democrats They are not Republicans They are not trying to get an advantage over anybody They are examining whether this bill stabilizes and strengthens Medicare puts seniors in a stronger position is going to see to it that we can extend the life of the program and provide guaranteed benefits that are needed and their answer was a resounding yesyes this bill is deserving of our support Again I appreciate the political debate here but at some point we have to step back and let those whose job it is to analyze our suggestions and our ideasjust as AARP supported President Bush 6 years ago with his prescription drug bill They didnt join Democrats or Republicans they liked the ideastill doand supported it Today they are not supporting us as Democrats They would reject this bill out of hand if they thought we did something adverse to the interest of their membership But they said No this is a good bill deserving of support The two largest organizations in this country representing seniors have said Get behind this bill Lets support our seniors Lets make Medicare stronger and strengthen it And this bill does it That is why we should be joining together not fighting over this Medicare Advantage is a private health care plan subsidized by the American taxpayer Eighty percent of the seniors dont get the Advantage That is why we are creating these changes in this bill I applaud my colleague from Montana the chairman of the Finance Committee who did incredible work along with his staff and other members in producing this product

gentleman it wasnt a liberal sitting in the White House who decided to invade Iraq for which the costs have now come due I reserve the balance of my time Madam Speaker I yield 3 minutes to my friend the gentleman from New Jersey Mr Andrews Mr ANDREWS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to my friend the gentleman from New York a voice of good sense on the issues of debt Mr Crowley Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I might consume Madam Speaker I rise in support of the debt limit legislation we are considering today and I want to thank Mr Rangel for his hard work on the bill in the waning days of the Congress this first session Let me talk about what the bill does This bill is simply about continuing operations for the Federal Government That is the title of the legislation Continuing operations means getting the Social Security checks out on time an almost sacred duty that we have This means providing support for our troops and keeping our museums and our parks open That is what an increase in the debt limit will allow Simply stated this is about bills that have already been incurred Now I will during my time here resist the temptation to become overly partisan and speak specifically to the issue that is in front of us until there is a misstatement of the facts in opposition What this bill does not do is increase or decrease spending That is a key consideration Those decisions have already been made through the regular order Let me emphasize the following This bill does not raise nor does it cut taxes That is different legislation I respect the opinion of all Members herewho by the way my hunch is have been on all sides of this issue during their time here in the Congress But we all desire the same and that is to bring our budget into balance with the future Beyond that there is broad agreement But this bill is simply paying the check after the items have already been ordered This bill would raise the limit by 290 billion which is estimated to allow the government to operate through February 11 and allow us to adjourn for the year Despite what some might say the Treasury Department will reach the current limit on the national debt by December 31 and they have told us that there is no ability to do extraordinary measures that will indeed stretch that out Now I hope that the offering that I make to resist demagoguery on this issue will be met If not we certainly will have an opportunity during the course of the next hour to slug it out based upon the facts and I hope that we will regard Social Security and veterans bills that have already been incurred to be paid We certainly can have moments of instructions herewere all indeed prepared for that on all sidesbut I hope that the opportunity to resist the temptation to dismiss the reality of what were doing here will be before all of us I reserve my time Madam Speaker I would like to yield to a voice of fiscal responsibility here in the House to Mr Boyd the gentleman from Florida for 2 minutes I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute Madam Speaker before I come to my friends comments I want to yield myself such time as I might consume Madam Speaker I spoke with Chairman Rangel earlier and it is our intention as we did this month in passing the Tax Extenders Act of 2009 to make sure that those provisions hold That bill contains a 1 year extension of dozens of important expiring provisions including the popular RD credit the sales tax deduction and the college tuition deduction among many others We are now hearing the Senate may not take up this provision or provisions and pass the bill before they expire on December 31 It is our intention to insist upon the House position and to work to ensure that our bill providing a seamless extension of these tax benefits will be enacted as soon as possible in the new year These provisions are crucial for both American business and individual taxpayers and I am pleased that we were able to get the House to pass this bill before the year concluded but it is disappointing that the other body will not be able to take it up this year It is our goal however to ensure that this bill will provide a seamless extension when enacted based upon the House measure Madam Speaker I want to thank Mr Pence because I thought that the tone of what he offered was entirely reasonable because he didnt pass out partisan blame in the instance that brings us here at this time But a gentle reminder I dont know how you could have voted for the war in Iraq and not vote now to pay the bill because thats part of what we are being asked to do today I understand how difficult this is why it causes heartburn But having said that how can you say that you were willing to commit 160000 soldiers to Iraq and when the bill comes due not pay it That essentially is the argument that is in front of us today And I understand the arguments about those American families who are having a difficult time as we proceed to this holiday season and we want to be as helpful to them as we can And as they gather around the kitchen table to talk about the problems they have we understand that we want to provide as much support for them as we can But lets not forget the Social Security recipients who are currently sitting around the table as they watch this debate wondering if their checks are going to be mailed to them on time at the first of the year With that I reserve the balance of my time Madam Speaker at this time I would like to yield 4 minutes to my friend the gentleman from Tennessee Mr Tanner who was my classmate here 21 years ago and is in my judgment as thoughtful as any Member of this House on the issues of the national debt I yield the gentleman 2 additional minutes Madam Speaker I yield the gentleman from New Jersey 1 additional minute Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee the gentleman from New York Mr Rangel Mr RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks Madam Speaker might I inquire as to how much time remains on both sides Madam Speaker this is not a cheery time for the American people This is a very difficult time A reminder The legislation in front of us now is to pay for the war in Iraq to pay for the war in Afghanistan to pay for our veterans hospitals and to pay for next months Social Security recipients to receive their checks on time I reserve the balance of my time Madam Speaker the war in Iraq is going to cost more than 1 trillion The VA hospital commitment that we are going to make for the next 30 years to our welldeserving veterans is going to cost an additional 1 trillion That is the issue that is before us this afternoon I reserve the balance of my time Madam Speaker I reserve the balance of my time Stearns is indeed my friend and we are classmates Madam Speaker he conveniently left out those 4 years when Bill Clinton left a balanced budget to America when the deficits were eliminated and when the debt was coming down Thats the key consideration here as we begin this debate Indeed this is about paying for our veterans hospitals paying for the war in Iraq paying for the war in Afghanistan and making sure that those Social Security checks get out on January 1 Madam Speaker I reserve the balance of my time Madam Speaker I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on HR 4314 Madam Speaker pursuant to clause 7 of rule XX I move a call of the House Madam Speaker I would like to reserve the balance of my time Madam Speaker let me recognize for 1 minute the Majority Leader the gentleman from Maryland Mr Hoyer a voice for fiscal reason in this institution Madam Speaker I urge adoption of the resolution and yield back the balance of my time

words and articulate words At this time Mr Speaker I would like to yield to the gentleman from Maryland Mr Cummings who is also a driving force behind this bill for 5 minutes Speaker I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill HR 3951 to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2000 Louisiana Avenue in New Orleans Louisiana as the Roy Rondeno Sr Post Office Building The Clerk read the title of the bill The text of the bill is as follows HR 3951 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled SECTION 1 ROY RONDENO SR POST OFFICE BUILDING a DesignationThe facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2000 Louisiana Avenue in New Orleans Louisiana shall be known and designated as the Roy Rondeno Sr Post Office Building b ReferencesAny reference in a law map regulation document paper or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection a shall be deemed to be a reference to the Roy Rondeno Sr Post Office Building Speaker I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and add any extraneous materials Mr Speaker as chairman of the House subcommittee with jurisdiction over the United States Postal Service I am pleased to present HR 3951 for consideration This legislation will designate the United States Postal Service facility located at 2000 Louisiana Avenue in New Orleans Louisiana as the Roy Rondeno Sr Post Office Building Introduced by my colleague Representative Anh Joseph Cao of Louisiana on October 28 2009 and reported out of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on November 18 2009 by unanimous consent HR 3951 enjoys the support of the entire Louisiana House delegation A native of New Orleans Louisiana Roy Rondeno Sr served his beloved community as a dedicated employee of the United States Postal Service for over 30 years Notably Mr Rondeno worked at the United States Postal Service facility at Uptown Station located at 2000 Louisiana Avenue in New Orleans the very facility that we seek to designate in his honor The true embodiment of the old adage that neither rain nor snow nor sleet will keep a postman from completing his rounds Mr Rondeno was roundly known as a dedicated and beloved letter carrier who would never fail to deliver even the smallest package in the pouring rain As noted by the New Orleans TimesPicayune newspaper many residents along Mr Rondenos route had formed a close relationship with this letter carrier and described him as a charismatic man who always had a kind word for everyone According to friend and Uptown resident Susan Hereford Mr Rondeno did not only deliver the mail every day but rather also delivered a little piece of himself and connected with everyone on his route Dr Brian Ghere another Uptown resident further describes Mr Rondeno as an exceptional human being a great letter carrier and a real credit to his profession The extent of Mr Rondenos commitment to his job and his Uptown residents that he was proud to serve was never more evident than on September 26 of this year Mr Rondeno volunteered to work on his day off given that the Uptown Station lacked enough letter carriers to cover the days route As Mr Rondeno was sorting mail on the back of his truck he was struck by a car and tragically lost both of his legs as a result of the accident The outpouring of support for Mr Rondeno and his family that followed his hospitalization stands as a true testament to Mr Rondenos standing in Uptown New Orleans as a model public servant and community member Notably local merchants and community leaders promptly established a donation fund to assist Mr Rondeno in his recovery and signs of support for the letter carrier could be seen hanging in a variety of local storefronts along his route Regrettably on October 2 only 6 days after this accident Mr Rondeno died from heart failure during surgery Mr Rondeno was only 57 years old at the time of his death and he had planned on retiring from the postal service early next year so as to focus his attention on serving his New Orleans community in a different capacity through an outreach ministry that he had recently founded with his beloved wife Shirley As noted by Acting Louisiana District Manager Peter Sgro upon Mr Rondenos passing Roy was a dedicated postal employee who wore his uniform proudly Everybody who knew him agreed he had a tremendous work ethic and always worked to provide the best service to his customers and the postal service Mr Speaker while Mr Rondeno is no longer with us his memory will undoubtedly live on through his wife Shirley his three sons Roy Richard and Ryan and all those who were fortunate enough to know this dedicated and hardworking public servant Mr Speaker it is my hope that we can pay tribute to the life and legacy of Mr Roy Rondeno Sr through the passage of this legislation to designate the Uptown postal facility in his honor I urge all of my colleagues to join us and Mr Cao the chief sponsor of this measure in supporting HR 3951 Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time Speaker in closing I urge all our colleagues to join Mr Cao the principal author of this bill to support House Resolution 3951 and I yield back the balance of my time Speaker in closing I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to support Mr MCGovern in the sponsorship of this measure HR 4017 Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time Speaker I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present Speaker I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill HR 2711 to amend title 5 United States Code to provide for the transportation of the dependents remains and effects of certain Federal employees who die while performing official duties or as a result of the performance of official duties as amended The Clerk read the title of the bill The text of the bill is as follows HR 2711 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress

which to revise and extend their remarks and add any extraneous materials Mr Speaker on behalf of the chairman of the full Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Towns and its members I am proud to present HR 2711 the Special Agent Samuel Hicks Families of Fallen Heroes Act for consideration This bipartisan legislation was introduced on June 4 2009 by Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan and several members of the Oversight Committee including Chairman Ed Towns and Representatives Bill Foster Elijah Cummings and Brian Bilbray In addition this legislation was favorably reported out of the Oversight Committee on September 10 2009 by voice vote HR 2711 is a worthy and important issue and I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this bill As reported by the Oversight Committee the legislation would authorize the FBI to pay the relocation and moving expenses for families of FBI agents who are killed in the line of duty Under current law the FBI is only authorized to pay these expenses if an FBI agent or an employee is killed overseas but cannot pay for relocation if the death occurs in the US FBI employees and their families are moved routinely by the Bureau within the United States to take on assignments that further the mission of the agency and the security of the country While we wish this legislation was not necessary tragically there have been instances in the recent past where such authority was needed to support the families of agents or employees who gave their lives Of course untimely deaths in the Federal law enforcement community are not limited to the FBI and the Bureau is not the only Federal agency that relocates its employees to better protect the country Recognizing this the bill we are considering on the floor today includes a straightforward but important amendment that recognizes the service and sacrifice of all Federal law enforcement officers The amendment simply extends the authority in this legislation to the other agencies that employ Federal law enforcement officers This amendment has strong support from the Federal law enforcement community I should also note that the costs associated with this bill remain small as the number of Federal law enforcement officers killed annually is approximately 12 to 15 officers We can and should assist each and every one of these families by supporting this amendment and this bill Moreover the amendment also pays tribute to the memory and service of Special Agent Samuel Hicks by renaming the legislation in his honor Special Agent Hicks was assigned to the Pittsburgh FBI office and was shot fatally on November 19 2008 at the age of 33 while executing a Federal search warrant associated with a drug distribution ring He is survived by his wife and their 2yearold son Special Agent Hicks was a former police officer with the Baltimore police department He and his family relocated to Pittsburgh when he became an FBI agent Unfortunately after the loss of Special Agent Hicks the Bureau was unable to assist the Hicks family in moving back to Baltimore because of statutory limitations This legislation would correct this problem and prevent future families from suffering additional unnecessary grief and hardship I encourage all the Members to support Mr Rogers and his legislation I reserve the balance of our time Speaker I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill HR 4017 to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 43 Maple Avenue in Shrewsbury Massachusetts as the Ann Marie Blute Post Office The Clerk read the title of the bill The text of the bill is as follows HR 4017 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled SECTION 1 ANN MARIE BLUTE POST OFFICE a DesignationThe facility of the United States Postal Service located at 43 Maple Avenue in Shrewsbury Massachusetts shall be known and designated as the Ann Marie Blute Post Office b ReferencesAny reference in a law map regulation document paper or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection a shall be deemed to be a reference to the Ann Marie Blute Post Office Speaker I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and add any extraneous materials Speaker I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts Mr MCGovern the chief sponsor of this measure 4017 was introduced by my friend and colleague Representative Jim MCGovern who we heard from earlier on November 4 2009 and was favorably reported out of the House Oversight Committee by unanimous consent on November 18 2009 In addition I am proud to say that I am an original cosponsor of HR 4017 which enjoys the support of the entire Massachusetts House delegation A beloved resident of the town of Shrewsbury Massachusetts Mrs Ann Marie Blute passed away on May 1 2009 at the age of 83 While Mrs Blute is no longer with us she will forever be remembered for her dedication to her loving family as well as her genuine and longstanding commitment to public service Born in the city of Boston on May 30 1925 and as the oldest daughter of eight children Mrs Blute quickly learned how to help in raising a large and very busy family In addition Mrs Blute was also able to witness the value of public service at a very early age as her father Colonel Paul Hines a distinguished veteran of World War I went on to serve in the Massachusetts House of Representatives As noted by the Boston Globe upon Mrs Blutes passing a commitment to public service ran in the genes of the Blute family as Mrs Blutes brother Peter served as chairman of the Boston city council and her son Peter as has been mentioned earlier by Mr MCGovern was elected to the United States Congress After receiving her education in the Boston public school system Mrs Blute accepted a position in the business office at the Boston Post newspaper where her mother Margaret Galvin Hines worked as a reporter In 1947 however Mrs Blute left Boston for the town of Bremerhaven Germany after marrying Dr Robert Blute a doctor with the United States Army and Mrs Blutes beloved husband for the next 62 years Together Mr and Mrs Blute would go on to have 11 children five sons and six daughters Upon their return from Germany the Blute family settled in the town of Shrewsbury Massachusetts where Mrs Blute embarked on her lifes work and journey as a mom not only to her own 11 children but also to the many neighborhood children that entered her life In addition Mrs Blutes arrival in Shrewsbury also marked the continuation of her lifelong dedication to serving others A devout Roman Catholic and devoted parishioner of St Marys as has been mentioned Mrs Blute actively participated in a variety of church community programs and activities Specifically Mrs Blute served on the Womens Guild taught catechism as Mr Cao has mentioned and became a Eucharistic minister In addition she was a founding member of the Associates of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur based in Ipswich Massachusetts And in 1994 Mrs Blute as Mr MCGovern has mentioned was called to St Patricks Cathedral in New York by Cardinal John OConnor to receive the title of Dame of Malta granted to those who demonstrate an intense devotion to service and one of the Catholic churchs highest honors Moreover Mrs Blute also served as a dedicated board member of various community organizations some of which have been mentioned including the Nazareth Home for Boys in Leicester Massachusetts and the Mustard Seed homeless shelter in the city of Worcester In addition Mrs Blutes community work included her service as a trustee of the Shrewsbury Library as well as her membership in the Shrewsbury Garden Club the Ladies Auxiliary of St Vincents Hospital and the Ladies Auxiliary of the Massachusetts Medical Society Notably Mrs Blute also spent several years volunteering for the nonprofit organization Aid to Incarcerated Mothers As so eloquently stated by her beloved husband Robert Mrs Blutes lifelong ambition was to perform each of the works of mercyto feed the hungry to help the poor to visit the prisoner and give aid to the sick and the stranger Mrs Blutes driving purpose was evidenced time and time again through her many good deeds Among them was the kindness and generosity that she displayed toward Lucy Hoang a Vietnamese immigrant who Mrs Blute lovingly took into her home for 3 years Mr Speaker the life of Mrs Ann Marie Blute stands as a testament to public service Her memory will undoubtedly live on through her husband Robert their 11 children 23 great grandchildren four great grandchildren her four siblings and the countless friends and neighbors for whom Mrs Blutes dedication to community service made the ultimate difference It is my hope that we can pay further tribute to Mrs Blutes remarkable legacy through the passage of this legislation to rename the Shrewsbury post office in her honor I urge my colleagues to join Mr MCGovern the chief sponsor of this bill in doing so and supporting HR 4017 Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time Rogers the gentleman from Michigan as well as the gentleman from Maryland Mr Cummings and one other driving force behind this our own chairman Ed Towns for supporting this measure HR 2711 as it really provides Federal law enforcement agencies with the necessary authority to support these families in their greatest time of need I yield back the balance of our time 
H_MD_CUMMINGS,2009-12-08,1996_2009,0048, 2711 the Special Agent Samuel Hicks Families of Fallen Heroes Act This legislation as has been said honors Pittsburgh FBI Special Agent Samuel Hicks who was shot and killed while executing a Federal search warrant on November 19 2008 Before joining the FBI Special Agent Hicks was a teacher and a city police officer in my hometown and the Congressional district I represent in Baltimore Maryland When arrangements were made for Special Agent Hicks to return to his final resting place in Baltimore moving expenses for his family to relocate were not covered This legislation would provide funds for the moving transportation and relocation expenses attributed to a change of residence within the United States of the immediate family of an FBI employee who dies in the performance of official duties It also covers the expenses of preparing and transporting the remains of the deceased to the place where the family will reside following the employees death I must commend Mr Rogers for this legislation I think its very much due As I was reading over the legislation I could not help but think to myself I hope we dont have to use the provisions of this legislation too often because I think all of us mourn whenever one of our law enforcement officers is harmed or killed Its a sad day Ive often said and weve often heard the words they are indeed our thin blue line If you dont think theyre the thin blue line you let something happen to you and they dont show up One of Special Agent Hicks colleagues said of him He was very skilled in everything encouraging always had a positive attitude and the first to step forward and volunteer for anything His colleague went on to say He was just the kind of guy who was a role model for other people in the academy who maybe didnt have experience or come from different backgrounds Mr Speaker this is just one of many examples of how dangerous a job like being an FBI agent can be but it is one that so many take on every single day not wondering whether they will return home to their families return to their neighborhoods His sacrifice is always going to be remembered through his family colleagues and hopefully through the passage of this legislation On May 2 2009 Special Agent Hicks name was added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington but that is simply not enough We must honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice by taking care of their loved ones who have also made a tremendous sacrifice Again I commend Congressman Rogers of Michigan and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Mr Lynch especially those original cosponsors of which Im one for the leadership with regard to this legislation With the passage of HR 2711 we can honor Special Agent Hicks and prevent future families from additional heartache and hardship at a very very difficult moment in their lives I encourage all the Members to support this legislation

S_CA_BOXER,2009-12-01,1993_2009; 1993_2009,0261; 0262, The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from California is recognized The plan is women colleagues will be coming to the floor As they come I will yield to them until Senator Mikulski gets here and then she will yield the time if that is all right President before I start I want to say to my colleague from Connecticut how much I appreciate his work and the work of Senator Baucus and Senator Reid What a remarkable moment we have here When I go homeand I was home for the holidayspeople are urging us to get this done They know their biggest chance of going into bankruptcy is a health care crisis62 percent They know as my friend Senator Dodd has said almost every day of this debate every morning 14000 people lose their health care They know if we do not intervene with a good bill their premiumsin my home State I say to the Senatorwill be 41 percent of their income the average income by 2016 Can you imagine That is unsustainable For people who say Why dont we address the economy instead of health care let me say what happens to my constituents if they have to pay 41 percent of their income for premiums Even if they have a good job I say to my friend from Connecticut they cannot make it So the status quo is cruel and it is particularly cruel to women Amendment No 2791 President I am proud to support the MikulskiHarkin Boxer amendment to improve preventive health coverage for women The Mikulski amendment addresses this critical issue by requiring that all health plans cover comprehensive womens preventive care and screeningsand cover these recommended services at little or no cost to women These health care services include annual mammograms for women at age 40 pregnancy and postpartum depression screenings screenings for domestic violence annual womens health screenings and family planning services The preventive services covered under this amendment would be determined by the Health Resources and Services Administration to meet the unique preventive health needs of women HRSA is an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has already said that Mammograms have always been an important lifesaving tool in the fight against breast cancer and they still are today The Secretary made clear that recommendations by the US Preventive Services Task Force do not set federal policy and they dont determine what services are covered by the federal government This is not the first time that experts have disagreed about this issue I have been in this battle before with Senator Mikulski who called a hearing with all of the women Senators in 1994 where I insisted that routine mammograms for women over 40 must be covered And thank goodness we fought back then and in 1997 and in 2002 when this issue was raised again and again Since 1991 the death rate from breast cancer has been reduced by over 20 percent According to a 2007 Partnership for Prevention report 3700 additional lives would be saved each year if we increased to 90 percent the portion of women age 40 and older who have been screened for breast cancer in the past 2 years The most recent data show us that approximately 17 percent of breast cancer deaths occurred in women who were diagnosed in their forties That is why the American Cancer Society continues to recommend annual screening using mammography and clinical breast examination for all women beginning at age 40 Mammograms are still the most effective and valuable tool for decreasing suffering and death from breast cancer The Mikulski amendment will ensure women are able to get access to this and other lifesaving preventive services at no cost The underlying bill introduced by Senator Reid already requires that preventive services recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force be covered at little to no cost These recommendations already include some womens preventive services such as osteoporosis screenings But they do not include certain recommendations that many womens health advocates and medical professionals believe are critically important such as screenings for ovarian cancera disease that will claim the lives of nearly 15000 women this year We know that when ovarian cancer is diagnosed early more than 93 percent of women survive longer than 5 years Women are often the decisionmakers for their families when it comes to health care But women too often put the health needs of their family members and their children ahead of their own By passing this amendment we are saving the lives of countless mothers daughters grandmothers and sisters who would otherwise forgo preventative health care because of high copays and expensive deductibles I would like to share with my colleagues a story from a doctor in my home State of California William Leininger that drives home the importance of this amendment In my last year of residency I cared for a mother of two who had been treated for cervical cancer when she was 23 At that time she was covered by her husbands insurance but it was an abusive relationship and she lost her health insurance when they divorced For the next five years she had no health insurance and never received followup care which would have revealed that her cancer had returned She eventually remarried and regained health insurance but by the time she came back to see me her cancer had spread She had two children from her previous marriageher driving motivation during her last rounds of palliative care was to survive long enough to ensure that her abusive ex husband wouldnt gain custody of her kids after her death She succeeded She was 28 when she died That is not a story that should be told in the richest nation in the world As I said I am so proud to support the MikulskiHarkinBoxer amendment to improve preventive health care coverage for women Here is why It is a fact that women are increasingly delaying or skipping altogether preventive health care and they are doing it because of costs I read a statistic done by a nonpartisan group that said about 39 percent of men are delaying going to a physician to check on a problem But over 50 percent of women are doing that either because they do not have health coverage or they are fearful of the copay So we could sit here and do nothingthat is the easy thing to do Scare people do nothingor we could step to the plate save Medicare which is very important to save and that is what this bill does Because we say we are not going to spend money on waste fraud and abuse We are going to spend money on health care for our people And to believe that my friends on the other side are the ones who are going to save Medicare You just have to read history Senator Dodd explained it Newt Gingrich saying Let Medicare wither on the vine Bob Dole our friend who said at the time of his Presidential campaign I fought against Medicare It was a failure Well if you ask our seniors I think they are the group most pleased with their coverage It is not perfect but it is critical and we save it here We extend the life of Medicare So here we are in a situation where many women are delaying going to the doctor getting their preventive services and the Mikulski amendment addresses this critical issue It requires that all health plans cover comprehensive womens preventive care and screenings and cover them at little or no cost The reason this is so important isfirst of all in the HELP Committee under Senator Dodds and Senator Kennedys leadership this piece of the package was in the bill because Senator Mikulski and others pushed so hard to get it placed into the bill Mr President I would ask my friend from Maryland Senator Mikulski if I could complete my remarks and then give the floor over to her Mr President I thank the Senator I am so proud to work with Senator Mikulski I say to the Senator we worked on this issue over the years I just asked my staff to go back and look at the first time we teamed up to ensure that women get mammograms at age 40 That was in 1994 Then again over the years every 3 or 4 years this whole notion would rear its ugly head Well women can do without mammography The question I have is What is going to replace it They would keep trying to take away our tools of self examination and mammography We know if you look through the yearsand Senator Mikulski and I are proud of a lot of the work we do but this goes right at the top of the listwe know mortality for breast cancer is way down since the early 1990s It is 20 percent down since the early 1990s We have had to stand our ground to protect women to make sure they get those services they need those lifesaving services at little or no cost I would also say the American Cancer Society continues to recommend annual screening using mammography and clinical breast exams for all women beginning at age 40 There are a lot of other very important tests that are included in the Mikulski amendmentvery important teststo deal with cervical cancer and ovarian cancer finding the markers so we know how to deal with these deadly diseases To give up the tools we have to turn it over to some organization that does not report to the Secretary of HHS makes no sense What my friend has done with her amendment is to make sure the group that decides this is under the jurisdiction of the HHS Secretary We know the HHS Secretary has already said she wants to make sure women starting at age 40 get those mammograms I am going to close by reading from an article in the March 10 1994 San Francisco Chronicle It says Joining what became a phalanx of six female Senators staring down at federal health officials Boxer said she will insist that routine mammograms and a host of other womens health needs be part of any new nationwide benefit package The article goes on It is very clear What I said at the time is After all of these years of women being told it is crucial by age 40 to get a baseline mammogram now to have this tremendous confusion hit us is very disturbing Well it was disturbing on March 10 1994 when I first got involved in this issue It was disturbing when Senator Snowe 3 years later had us pass S Res 47 which said this is our only tool Lets do it Thank goodness we have now in this body women and men who get the fact that we refuse as women to be stripped of the only tools we have Making all of these important tests part of this package is going to save lives It is going to save money It is going to mean our families can breathe a deep sigh of relief out there So I wish to thank Senator Mikulski for her leadership on this issue and to always stand right at her side on this issue of mammography We also worked on standards for mammography Remember that one It was the deregulation fever that hit the Republican side They wanted to take away the regulations for mammography roll them back We fought the fight and we will continue to fight the fight So thank you very much I strongly support this amendment I yield the floor for my friend Senator Mikulski The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Maryland is recognized

from Maryland Senator Mikulski I believe is on her way to the floor of the Senate She and several other Members in the time we have allocated to us between now and 1130 will address her amendment she proposed yesterday But pending her arrival I want to respond if I could very briefly to some of the conversation here this morning First I know some people have short memories but I am somewhat intrigued to hear our good friends and colleagues talk about preserving Medicare I have been around here a few years and recall very vividly the debates of 1995 and 1997 on the issue of Medicare where our friends who were in the majority in those days were talking about slowing the growth of Medicare and one of the proposals they had for doing so was to cut into the benefits of Medicare recipients We do not do that in this bill at all Quite to the contrary despite the language about big cuts in Medicare we strengthen the Medicare Program substantially That is the reason the AARP and other major organizations involved with the elderly have endorsed our proposals They would hardly be doing so if they thought this was some massive cut into the Medicare Program that has been so critical to so many of our fellow citizens Just for a little bit of history hereIn 1995 our Republican colleagues proposed cutting benefits to Medicare beneficiaries Newt Gingrich our former Speaker and friend from the other body was quoted as saying lets let Medicare wither on the vine That is not ancient history That is not 1965 That is just a few years ago in all of this debate There are some very strong provisions in the bill that reduce premiums and copays for seniors ensure seniors are able to see their own doctors and keep Medicare from going bankrupt for an additional 5 years If we adopt the MCCain amendment we are being told today by CBO and others that Medicare becomes insolvent in 8 years So vote for the MCCain amendment and you are going to have an insolvent program in 8 years That is a fact We extend the life here an additional 5 years We provide new preventive and wellness benefits for seniors lower prescription drug costs allow seniors to stay in their homes and not end up in nursing homes This is a long bill It is a big bill But instead of complaining about its size I would encourage my colleagues to read it and understand what is being done for Medicare This is a complicated area but nonetheless critically important Mr President I see my colleague from California Senator Boxer who is here and others who want to address the issue of the Mikulski amendment and I will yield the floor so they can be heard I believe it is going to be each for 5 minutes There are about seven of our colleagues who want to be heard on the issue before 1130 Madam President I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for 1 minute 7 seconds and the time be taken from that of my good friend and colleague from Vermont the chairman of the Judiciary Committee Madam President Senator Tom Coburn and I have become great friends We have spent a lot of time together this summer in my HELP Committee He talked with great eloquence about that distance that can occur between a doctor and patient and obviously as someone who practiced medicine for a long time he speaks from strong personal experience and I admire and respect that immensely But let me say to my colleagues without this bill we are talking about here this comes to a simple choice Under existing law the way things are today one institution stands between a doctor and patient and that is your insurance company They ration care all the time In fact I am a living example of rationed care having been through surgery getting preapproval twice before surgery and then being rejected by the very insurance company I paid premiums to for a long time as a Member of this body We are working it out I believe because they thoughtI am 65that Medicare ought to pay for my surgery rather than the company I paid premiums to for a long time They were rationing my care That insurance company it wasnt some government entity or someone else they are the ones Without our bill the only one getting to decide what health services anyone receives is the insurance industry I hope we would have a chance to debate this further as I am confident we will Let me also say how much I support the effort by Senator Mikulski on her efforts to see to it that women are treated equally and particularly in preventive care and I strongly urge the adoption of her amendment and ask to be added as a cosponsor to that amendment President the Senator from Iowa is to be recognized next Just to set the record straight because it is amazing to me in a very short amount of time how people can misconstrue events First of all the Senator from Oklahoma was talking about the Medicare Advantage bill and he said Do you know who sets the rates The government sets the rates That is true That is because when that bill was passed with very few people on this side supporting that billalmost overwhelmingly on the other sidethe requirement under the law the requirement to pass mandated under the law that the private plans of Medicare be overpaid and on average those overpayments averaged 14 percent and in some States over 50 percent The law that was passed here by the majority and running the place at the timeinsisted upon the mandates being included So if you wonder why that occurs today it is because they required it in the law Secondly when you talk about the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 again memories fade for some people In fact under that bill children working families lost the insurance they had Cuts occurred Women lost access to mammographies Cervical cancer screenings were cut Families lost benefits There were direct cuts in them The difference is today with what we are talking about you dont cut these benefits at allat all In fact we are increasing the opportunity for Medicare to be strengthened under this bill There is a vast difference between what happened in 2005 and what is being supported today So again I just want the record to be clear You cant make these things up as you go along That is what happened in 2005 It was an abomination and did great damage to people in this country People lost their insurance Under our bill 31 million Americans will have coverage We now know the premiums are going to drop for 93 percent of all Americans Premiums will actually come down for individuals small businesses and large employers For five out of six people who have their jobs those premiums come down Thirtyone million Americans will be covered with health insurance Compare that if you will with 2005 when we actually cut mammography screening cervical cancer research and assistance in health care for infants and children and women That all got damaged in that year Not in this bill This is the difference I thank my colleague for yielding People had the right to do so that was their choice at the time But to try to rewrite history somehow and say those cuts didnt occurin fact they did occur in these areas That is why there were those of us here who objected strongly at the time My colleague from Arizona is absolutely correct when he said that I said this was going to cut benefits for children and working families and cut screenings and tests for people It did do that Those of us who made those warnings on that day were proven to be 100 percent accurate Compare that if you will with what we are talking about here today particularly regarding reducing costs premiums and providing increased access for millions of Americans That is the difference If you vote for the MCCain amendment we are right back where we were beforeright backwhich of course we all know means premium increases go up by literally 100 percent in the next 7 years Tell that to a family of four in my State who is paying 12000 right now and will go to 24000 in 7 years as opposed to having those premiums being reduced depending on if you are an individual small business or large employer by as much as 20 percent 11 percent or 3 percent not to mention of course that you will also increase the number of people who will be covered under this The present situation runs the risk of bringing our economy to its knees if we dont act Recommitting this billgoing back in a sense would roll the clock back and do great damage to both individuals and to our country economically That vote in 2005 set us back terribly in this country This proposal allows us to move forward and provide the coverage a lot of people need I thank my colleague President I ask unanimous consent if I may that I be allowed to speak for 15 minutes and that that time include a colloquy with my colleague the Senator from Minnesota I wish to address a couple issues if I may one is this debate about Medicare cuts and savings Let me put up one chart I will not spend a long time on this but I wish to make a point to my colleagues About a year ago the Bush administration sent us a budget According to the Congressional Budget Office and the Senate Budget Committee the proposals in the Bush administrations budget in the last year alone called for 481 billion in Medicare savings and cuts It was not in the context of a health care bill that was part of a budget proposal That was 481 billion according to the CBO just last year Literally 12 months ago that was the proposal In the context of the overall reform of the health care system in which we are trying to achieve savings to make sure the dollars are going to go further and go for the things that are needed our proposal calls for 380 billion in savings over the coming 10 years I think again people need to understand what we are talking about and that is the difference So a year ago 481 billion and no health care proposaljust to get to budget proposals Here we are in the context of over 10 years of trying to put things in this bill to ensure a more solid footing The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare representing millions of our fellow citizens wrote a letter to the Senate every Member dated December 1 2009 Senator Harkin earlier put the entire letter in the Record I am going to read just one sentence from the letter signed by Barbara Kennelly the President and CEO of this organization Not a single penny of the savings in the Senate bill This bill we are debating will come out of the pockets of beneficiaries in the traditional Medicare program This is an organization that does not bear a political label It doesnt represent Democrats Republicans Independents It merely spends every hour of every working day assessing what happens to Social Security and Medicare That is all they doall they do Believe me when I tell my colleagues this organization would not make a statement such as this if it were untrue I know the organization I know the people involved They are highly critical of Democrats and have been when they think we have gone too far in various areas They state categorically what this bill does to Medicare I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be printed in the Record There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows National Committee To Preserve Social Security and Medicare Washington DC December 1 2009 US Senate Washington DC Dear Senator On behalf of the millions of members and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare I am writing to express our opposition to the amendment offered by Senator MCCain which would recommit HR 3590 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to the Senate Finance Committee with instructions to remove important Medicare provisions Much of the rhetoric from opponents of health care reform is intended to frighten our nations seniors by persuading them that Medicare will be cut and their benefits reduced so that they too will oppose this legislation The fact is that HR 3590 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act does not cut Medicare benefits rather it includes provisions to ensure that seniors receive highquality care and the best value for our Medicare dollars This legislation makes important improvements to Medicare which are intended to manage costs by improving the delivery of care and to eliminate wasteful spending The National Committee opposes any cuts to Medicare benefits Protecting the Medicare program along with Social Security has been our key mission since our founding 25 years ago and remains our top priority today In fact these programs are critical lifelines to todays retirees and we believe they will be even more important to future generations But we also know that the cost of paying for seniors health care keeps rising even with Medicare paying a large portion of the bill That is why we at the National Committee support savings in the Medicare program that will help lower costs Wringing out fraud waste and inefficiency in Medicare is critical for both the federal government and for every Medicare beneficiary The Senate bill attempts to slow the rate of growth in Medicare spending by two to three percent or not quite 500 billion over the next 10 years However it is important to remember that the program will continue growing during this time Medicare will be spending increasing amounts of money and providers will be receiving increased reimbursementson a per capita basis every one of those years for a total of almost 9 trillion over the entire decade Even with the savings in the Senate bill we will still be spending more money per beneficiary on Medicare in the coming decades though not quite as much as we would be spending if the bill fails to pass Americas seniors have a major stake in the health care reform debate as the skyrocketing costs of health care are especially challenging for those on fixed incomes Not a single penny of the savings in the Senate bill will come out of the pockets of beneficiaries in the traditional Medicare program The Medicare savings inclued in HR 3590 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will positively impact millions of Medicare beneficiaries by slowing the rate of increase in outofpocket costs and improving benefits and it will extend the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund by five years To us this is a winwin for seniors and the Medicare program The National Committee urges you to oppose the motion to recommit the bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to strike important Medicare provisions from health care reform legislation Cordially Barbara B Kennelly President CEO Thirdly I wish to commend our colleague from Maryland Senator Mikulski Again a lot has been said about her proposal dealing with womens health Consider these two statistics as we try to get this right Less than half the women in the United States have the option of obtaining health insurance through a jobless than half They are forced either to purchase expensive insurance in the individual market or are dependent upon a spouse to provide health care Right now today whether you are a Democrat Republican conservative liberal whether you live in Connecticut Texas or Minnesota consider this A healthy 22yearold woman can be charged insurance rates 150 percent higher than a 22yearold man in a similar condition Our bill before us ends thatends that If you defeat the Mikulski amendment or recommit this bill remember tonight or tomorrow when the vote occurs that 22yearold woman and that 22yearold man have a differential as much as 150 percent in health care premiums That is what happens at this very hour The Mikulski amendment changes that as well in our bill among other things Lastlyand then I wish to turn to my colleague from Minnesotajust to remind my colleagues again what Senator Baucus has done with his committee in the Finance Committee and what we did in the HELP Committee to provide some meaningful advantages and help to people across this country immediately One our bill will provide 5 billion in immediate Federal support for a new program to provide affordable coverage to uninsured Americans with preexisting conditions Coverage under this program will continue until the new exchanges are operating over the next few years Secondly the bill creates immediate access to reinsurance for employer health care plans providing coverage for early retirees Again this will help protect coverage while reducing premiums for employers and their retirees The bill also reduces the size of the doughnut hole immediately by raising the ceiling in initial coverage by 500 in 2010 the coming yearimmediately This will guarantee a 50percent price discount on brandname drugs and biologics purchased by low and middleincome beneficiaries in the coverage gap That is immediate Fourth our bill will offer tax credits immediately to small businesses to make employee coverage more affordable That is not a year or two or three from now this is immediate Tax credits of up to 50 percent of premiums will be available to firms that choose to offer the coverage as a result of the tax break Fifth our bill will require insurers to permit children to stay on family policies until age 26 Right now that ends at 23 Our bill extends it to 26 immediately to have this benefit for people across the country who have families and children today who are staying home longer because of the absence of jobs out there for them Our bill will provide coverage for prevention and wellness benefits immediately and exempt these benefits from deductibles and other cost sharing requirements in public and private insurance coverage Not in a year not 2 years not 3 years but immediately when this bill becomes law Sixth the bill would prohibit insurers from imposing lifetime limits on benefits and will restrict annual limits as well The bill also would prohibit group health plans from establishing eligibility rules of health care coverage that have the effect of discriminating in favor of higher wage employees In this bill we also establish standards for insurance overhead to ensure that premiums are spent on health benefits We also require public disclosure of overhead and benefit spending and require premium rebates from insurers that exceed established standards for overhead expenses Lastly it would create new Web sites to provide information on a facilitated form of consumer choice of insurance options And there are other immediate benefits to this legislation I think it is important as we discuss the bill that you understand there are substantial and meaningful improvements We have debated this bill and debated these issues for months and months on end The time has come to act That is what we are proposing with this legislation With that I appreciate the indulgence of my colleague from Minnesota I yield to him for any additional comments he may wish to make I suspect we are going to have a lot of time to talk about the bill I appreciate the comments of my colleague from Minnesota 
S_MD_MIKULSKI,2009-12-01,1987_2009; 1987_2009,0230; 0231, President as we debate health care reform we need to recognize in the United States of America that health care is a womens issue Health care reform is a mustdo womens issue and health insurance reform must be a mustchange womens issue Too often when we look at when health care is even available to us we face discrimination We face continually the punitive practices of insurance companies that charge women more and give us less in a benefit A 25yearold woman pays more for health insurance than her male counterpart of the same health status A 40yearold woman pays almost 35 percent more for her insurance than a male of the same age same health status We want to change that in health care reform We want to end the punitive practices of the private insurance companies in their gender discrimination We the women of the Senate are concerned that even being a woman is being viewed by the insurance companies as a preexisting condition Now we have the opportunity to change the law and change the direction of health care I have offered an amendment to expand the screening and preventive services available to women in order to save our lives make sure our lives are not impaired as we get older and at the same time be able to save money We know early detection saves lives curtails the expansion of disease and in the long run saves money There are certain killers of women the dread c word cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer cervical cancer that are unique to we women Then there is the dread disease of lung cancer that affects men and women but is emerging as a main killer of women Then there is the other issue of heart disease and vascular disease We know for years women were often left out of the research on heart disease For years womens heart disease went undetected and unrecognized because our symptoms are different We can change this law In my amendment we expand the key preventive services for women and we do it in a way that is based on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and from HRSA It will be based on the benefit package available to Federal employees It means if our amendment passes the women of America will have the same access to preventive and screening services as the women of Congress What is good enough for a United States Senator should be good enough for any woman in the United States of America That is why we ask not only the women to join us but the good men of quality who support us We know people such as Senator Dodd Senator Reid Senator Baucus men of quality never fear we women who seek equality They have raced for the cure as long and as hard as we have and have fought for mammogram standards This is why we are wearing pink today Pink is the universal color that says while we race for the cure we want to have access to it when we find it But to have access to the cure we are going to need to have access to mammograms to be able to get that diagnosis and then we are going to have to have health insurance to be able to pay for the treatment we have This is the Titanic battle we have today Are we going to have access to health insurance and are we going to have access to these preventive services We do know in the area of heart disease and cancer and silent undetected killers such as diabetes it is often undetected What happens is for many women they do not get that early detection and screening No 1 because they cant afford it They cant afford it because they either dont have health insurance and there are other demands on their family or No 2 when they go if they do have insurance they find their benefit might not be covered So many of these benefits are based on State mandates but worse than that it is the copayments and high deductibles Many women say Well my insurance company provides for it but this copayment and deductible I have to choose between my childrens shoes or my deductible We want to either eliminate or shrink those deductibles and eliminate that high barrier that overwhelming hurdle that prevents women from having access to these early detection and screening programs Much is being debated about mammograms We believe access to mammograms should be universal universal access But the decision on whether to get one should be made with your doctor Well that is great to say but you need to have access to your doctor You need to not have to overcome the high hurdle of deductions or copayments to be able to do it We know mammogram screenings decrease breast cancer by over 40 percent Regular pap smears reduce cervical cancer by 40 percent This year 4000 women will die of cervical cancer Then lets take the dread but often overlooked diabetic screening Diabetes is the underlying cause of twothirds of chronic illness in both younger and older women If we find it early and get everybody in the right program they are going to be able to get the treatment they need so they dont lose an eye they dont lose a kidney they dont lose a leg We cant lose any more time We need to provide universal access to health care to the American people and we need to make sure they have access to the screening and early preventive actions that will save lives Mr President I urge the adoption of the Mikulski amendment and I thank you for your leadership on this issue I ask unanimous consent that the remaining time be equally divided between Governor Shaheen Senator Hagan Senator Murray and Senator Gillibrand The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Dodd Without objection it is so ordered Who seeks recognition The Senator from New Hampshire Madam President that concludes our discussion and our responses to this portion of the health care reform bill I must say Alert alert alert We have just been informed that a shrill advocacy group is spreading lies about this amendment They are saying that because it is prevention it includes abortion services There are no abortion services included in the Mikulski amendment It is screening for diseases that are the biggest killers for womenthe silent killers of women It also provides family planningbut family planning as recognized by other acts Please no more lies Lets get off of it and save lives

0509; 0510, President I wonder if the Senator from Wyoming would be available to answer a question Is it true the CBO letters say the Senate bill will extend the life extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund Is that true Madam President I yield myself 212 minutes from the time under the control of the managers For the benefit of all Senators I want to take a moment to lay out todays program The time between now and 1145 is for debate on the amendment by the Senator from Maryland Ms Mikulski the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Retirement and Aging of the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee And at the same time we will debate the sidebyside amendment by the Senator from Alaska Ms Murkowski At 1145 the Senate will conduct two backtoback rollcall votes on the two amendments first on the amendment by the Senator from Maryland and second on the amendment by the Senator from Alaska Thereafter we will conduct approximately 2 hours of debate on the MCCain motion to commit on Medicare and the sidebyside amendment by the Senator from Colorado Mr Bennet At 245 the Senate will conduct two backtoback votes on the amendment by the Senator from Colorado followed by a vote on the motion to commit by the Senator from Arizona Thereafter we expect to turn to another Democratic firstdegree amendment and another Republican first degree amendment This is the fourth day on this bill and we are only late this morning coming to our first vote Even for the US Senate this is a slow pace I note that some have made plans for delaying this bill in even more extreme fashion As the majority leader noted on Tuesday one Senator circulated a list of delaying tactics available under the Senate rules I presume all Senators know the Senates rules already So to send the letter leaves the impression that that Senator would like to urge Senators to use some of the delaying tactics stated in the memo But I urge a more cooperative course Out of courtesy to other Senators who desire to offer amendments I urge my colleagues to allow us to reach unanimous consent agreements to order the voting of future amendments in a more timely fashion That is simply the only way that we can ensure that more colleagues will have the time and opportunity to offer and debate their amendments I thank all Senators The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator has consumed his time I ask unanimous consent that the order of December 2 be modified to delete all after the word table The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Without objection it is so ordered I ask unanimous consent that the debate time from 2 to 245 this afternoon be divided as follows in the order listed the first 1712 minutes under the control of Senator MCCain or his designee the next 17 minutes under the control of Senator Baucus or his designee and the final 10 minutes 5 minutes each for Senator MCCain and Senator Bennet of Colorado The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Without objection it is so ordered The Senator from Iowa Madam President will the Senator yield for a quick inquiry to my friend from Wyoming Madam President I might inquire of my colleague from Wyoming if that item the Senator was quoting from about costs in the Wall Street Journal was a news article or an editorial Well I do not knowto be totally fair and respectful to one of my very best friends in the Senateto cover that point isnt it also true the Congressional Budget Office said in the second 10 years this bill will reduce the budget by onequarter percent of GDP Isnt that also true according to the Congressional Budget Office President I am going to speak very briefly on the pending subject and then let the sponsor of the amendment that is the Mikulski amendment finish up here I think it is very tellingI know this point has been made before but I think it bears repeatingthe American Heart Association American Stroke Association has written and released to the Senate this letter I will read the most important part here Basically they say they strongly support requiring health plans and Medicare providing first dollar coverage for clinical preventive services that are evidence based and necessary for the prevention or early detection of an illness or disability We all agree with that They go on then to comment on the Murkowski amendment saying they appreciate the Murkowski amendment recognized the value of the guidance and recommendations but they go on to say that even these guidelines must be held to a standard of being evidence based I might say I run across this over and over again in the medical professionmedical experts We need to keep moving more and more toward evidencebased medicine This statement from the American Heart Association American Stroke Association goes on to say In addition we are concerned that Senator Murkowskis preventive health services amendment would take a step backwards by substituting the judgment of the independent US Preventive Services Task Force with the judgment of private health insurance companies Frankly it is a point I very much agree with I dont think we want the judgment of private health insurance companies making these decisions I think it is appropriate the sponsor of the amendment finish She is doing a very good job That is what the letter says Thank you I dont have the letter in front of me but in all deference and respect to my good friend from Wyoming the CBO says the exact opposite It is the conclusion of the Congressional Budget Office that this legislation will help seniors by extending the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by I guess 4 to 5 years That is black and white If I had the letter in front of me I could read it to him but that is a fact This legislation will extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by another 5 years So instead of being insolvent in the year 2017 under this legislation that is extended to the year 2022 That is a fact At least the fact is that is what CBO concludes in their letter That is a fact Second as a caring physician does the Senator think that we as a country should try to find a way to provide health insurance for so many Americanssome of them lower incomewho dont have health insurance in our country Because after all we are the only industrialized country in the world that doesnt find a way to make sure its citizens have health insurance As a physician who sees patients many of whom cant pay their bills and defer medical treatment because they do not have health insurance I am wondering if the Senator believes this country should try to find a way where its citizens have health insurance I will ask this question and then I will finish because I know my colleagues want to speak One of the basic underpinnings of this legislation is that we should change the way we reimburse providers moving away from quantity and volume and more toward quality I am curiousand this is not an antagonistic question I am just trying to get a physicians point of view because so many doctors I talk to think that although it creates a little uncertainty probably that is the right thing to doto move our reimbursing based on quality coordinated care and focusing on the patient rather than our current system which reimburses more on quantity and the number of services provided et cetera Is that something the Senator thinks we should pursue in this country My colleagues want to speak but I think it is worth repeating over and over again This legislation is designed to retain the uniquely American solution to health careroughly half public half private It is designed to make sure patients can still as they should choose their own doctor any doctor they wantprimary care doc specialist no gatekeepers and all that stuff The doctors are totally free and should be free to make their own decisions after consultation with their patients as to what procedure makes sense or doesnt make sense In addition to that frankly more competition with the exchanges This legislation frankly is rooted almost entirely on maintaining the current free market system in health care There is some insurance market reform which I think everybody agrees with which is denying preexisting conditions as a basis for denying coverage and there is a modest expansion of Medicaid for lower income people who just cant get health care but otherwise this is legislation which is rooted in the current American system We have a good system It works This is just designed to make it work a little better by making sure it reimburses as the Senator from Wyoming wants based more on quality He didnt mention this but I know he agrees also insurance market reform so those patients who come to him dont have to wait until the end of the year in the future as they have in the past But I want to get it very clear this is no government takeover That is a scare tactic It is not accurate It is basically maintaining our current system I would now like to yield 10 minutes to my good friend from Vermont President I ask how much time is remaining on each side President I yield 9 minuteshow many seconds President I do not think I have any time but I ask unanimous consent that as to the time I do have after 2 oclock I can take 2 minutes of that so I can ask a question of my good friend from Iowa President I might ask my friend from Iowa Senator Grassley a question if he is available for a question I am taking time Is it true the Congressional Budget Office said this bill over 10 years is not only deficit neutral but actually decreases the budget deficit by about 130 billion Is that true Is that what the Congressional Budget Office said Reserving the right to object under current law if less is spent for Medicare providers the benefits inure to the Medicare trust fund beneficiaries Although I have the greatest respect for the Senator from Iowa this is a stunt and I object The Senator from Tennessee says this is going to hurt seniors Lets ask the senior organizations what they think about that Lets also look at this organization called 60 Plus What does the AARP say in the letter to Senator Reid dated December 2 It talks about this legislation The legislation before the Senate properly focuses on provider reimbursement reforms I am sorry all my colleagues have fled the Senate I would like for them to stay and listen to this I would like to hear their response But they have just fled the Senate after making sound bites The AARP letter dated December 2 states The legislation before the Senate properly focuses on provider reimbursement reforms Most importantly the legislation does not reduce any guaranteed Medicare benefits That is AARP All this is scare talk about grandma With all due respect to my friend from Tennessee he says that He has been using that phrase a lot But AARP says that grandma is fine AARP says Most importantly the legislation does not reduce any guaranteed Medicare benefits It doesnt reduce any benefits according to AARP Going on AARP believes that savings can be found in Medicare The savings in Medicare will extend the solvency of Medicare I am sure my friend from Tennessee knows the actuary said this legislation extends the solvency of Medicare helps Medicare The benefits go on longer than the status quo Also it does so according to AARP by eliminating waste and inefficiency and aggressively rooting out fraud and abuse The last sentence is We therefore urge you to oppose the MCCain amendment to recommit The AARP says this hurts seniors the MCCain motion to commit I think the job of the AARP is to figure out what is best for seniors That is their conclusion It is not just AARPs view There is another letter This is from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare They say basically this legislation doesnt cut Medicare benefits Again this is the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare They say rather this legislation includes provisions to ensure that seniors receive highquality care and the best value for their Medicare dollars That is a very reputable senior organization AARP is a very reputable senior organization The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare is a very reputable organization That is what they say Who is this 60 Plus association I have heard referred to Let me just tell my colleagues what 60 Plus really is I will read this This is from Wikipedia and it may not be accurate It says this about 60 Plus The 60 Plus Association is an American conservative advocacy group based in Arlington Virginia that bills itself as the conservatives alternative to the AARP That makes good sense because over the years it has sought to privatize Social Security 60 Plus over the years has sought to privatize Social Security They want to end the Federal estate tax They also want to strengthen gun rights but that is not relevant According to the AARP And this is a bit biased the 60 Plus Association employed the talents of conservative direct mail mogul Richard A Viguerie to solicit new members We all know who Viguerie is 60 Plus is a very conservative organization I dont think they are real interested in senior citizens They have different fish to fry Also AARP criticized 60 Plus as being partisan because its issues and causes mirror those of only one of two major parties the Republican Party A final criticism leveled by the AARP about 60 Plus is that because it lists no duespaying members and get this receives the majority of its contributions from the pharmaceutical industry the group is simply a front organization for the pharmaceutical industry I ask unanimous consent to have these letters in opposition to the MCCain amendment in support of the Bennet amendment and the Wikipedia information printed in the Record There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows Alliance for Retired Americans Washington DC December 1 2009 Dear Senator The Alliance for Retired Americans on behalf of its nearly four million members throughout the nation opposes the motion by Senator John MCCain to commit the Patient Protection and Affordable Care America Act HR 3590 to the Finance Committee We urge its prompt defeat by the Senate The MCCain motion to commit would seriously undermine important substantive and positive changes in the health care needs of older Americans contained in the bill none more important than proposed Medicare improvements In fact the MCCain motion would increase health care burdens on Medicare beneficiaries in several instances The MCCain motion would for the first time subject Medicare Part D prescription drug premiums to means testing causing a rise in premiums for many older Americans In addition the motion to commit would halt indexing to Medicare Part B physicians services premiums causing even more seniors to pay higher premiums which currently can be as much as 300 per month Furthermore the MCCain motion would continue the wasteful Medicare Advantage overpayments that currently threaten the financial stability of the Medicare Trust Fund The Alliance supports provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that improve health care for older Americans such as allowing Medicare beneficiaries to keep their choice of doctors lowering prescription drug costs eliminating copayments for preventive screenings expanding access to longterm supports and service and providing assistance for preMedicare eligible early retirees All of these improvements will not be possible should the MCCain motion pass The legislation does not cut Medicare benefits With the expected rising costs of Medicare the legislation slows the rate of the programs growth without reducing benefits The MCCain motion would actually undercut fiscally responsible attempts to meet the challenges of providing health care for older Americans The Alliance for Retired Americans is committed to enacting legislation that improves the quality of life for retirees and all Americans Defeat of the MCCain motion to commit the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to the Finance Committee will directly benefit our members and more than forty million older Americans If we can be of assistance please contact Richard Fiesta Director of Government and Political Affairs at the Alliance Sincerely yours Barbara J Easterling President Ruben Burks SecretaryTreasurer Edward F Coyle Executive Director AARP Washington DC December 2 2009 Hon Harry Reid Majority Leader US Senate Washington DC Dear Leader Reid AARP supports moving forward on health care reform and we remain committed to enacting legislation this year that protects and strengthens Medicare improves the delivery of health care and provides affordable insurance for all Accordingly we oppose the amendment offered by Senator MCCain to recommit HR 3590 to the Senate Finance Committee As we have said from the outset AARP supports a balance of revenues and savings with shared responsibility from individuals employers and the government With respect to Medicare AARP supports policies to eliminate waste fraud and abuseand to improve the quality value and sustainability of the program for current and future beneficiaries The legislation before the Senate properly focuses on provider reimbursement reforms to achieve these important policy objectives Most importantly the legislation does not reduce any guaranteed Medicare benefits AARP believes that savings can be found in Medicare through smart targeted changes aimed at improving health care delivery eliminating waste and inefficiency and aggressively weeding out fraud and abuse Such changes will help strengthen Medicares longterm financing without increasing costs for beneficiaries that make health care less affordable Medicare provides critical health security to older Americans and it is important that Medicare continue to deliver high quality care As health care costs including Medicare costs continue to skyrocket it is essential that we make changes to improve health care delivery improve Medicares financing and ensure maximum value for our Medicare dollars We believe that Medicare changes in this bill begin to move us down this path without reducing guaranteed Medicare benefits With these savings the legislation before the Senate takes important steps to improve access to preventive services for Medicare beneficiaries However more should be done to strengthen Medicareincluding closing the Medicare Part D coverage gap or doughnut hole as pledged by the President We therefore urge you to oppose the MCCain amendment to recommit and we remain firmly committed to working with you to strengthen Medicare and enact comprehensive health care reform this year that improves access and affordability of health care for all Sincerely Addison Barry Rand National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare Washington DC December 3 2009 US Senate Washington DC Dear Senator On behalf of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicares millions of members and supports I am pleased to endorse the amendment of Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado which clarifies that HR 3590 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act would improve the Medicare program as part of health care reform Senator Bennets amendment puts into law two of the most important criteria the National Committee has been using when analyzing health care reform proposals First it states explicitly that the legislation would not reduce any of Medicares guaranteed benefits Second it ensures that savings from Medicare would be used to improve Medicare Improvements in HR 3590 include extending the solvency of the Medicare trust funds by five years reducing the amount of future increases in premiums eliminating costsharing for preventive benefits making prescription drugs more affordable and ensuring access to Medicare providers Protecting Medicare and Social Security has been the National Committees key mission since our founding 27 years ago and remains our top priority today Our members are no different than seniors all over this country who are nervous about rising outofpocket health care costs and are concerned about the Medicare savings in health care reform legislation This is a legitimate concern but it is important to put these savings in perspective The federal government will spend almost 9 trillion on Medicare in the next decade The proposed savings of nearly 500 billion mean that the growth in spending will be reduced by about two percent over the next 10 years by eliminating wasteful spending and outright fraud The HR 3590 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes savings that are designed to protect Medicare beneficiaries and improve the Medicare program Senator Bennets amendment expressly prohibits any reductions in guaranteed Medicare benefits and makes sure all savings are reinvested back into Medicare I urge you to support the Bennet amendment which is important to Medicare beneficiaries and the solvency of the Medicare program Cordially Barbara B Kennelly President CEO National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare Washington DC December 1 2009 US Senate Washington DC Dear Senator On behalf of the millions of members and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare I am writing to express our opposition to the amendment offered by Senator MCCain which would recommit HR 3590 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to the Senate Finance Committee with instructions to remove important Medicare provisions Much of the rhetoric from opponents of health care reform is intended to frighten our nations seniors by persuading them that Medicare will be cut and their benefits reduced so that they too will oppose this legislation The fact is that HR 3590 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act does not cut Medicare benefits rather it includes provisions to ensure that seniors receive highquality care and the best value for our Medicare dollars This legislation makes important improvements to Medicare which are intended to manage costs by improving the delivery of care and to eliminate wasteful spending The National Committee opposes any cuts to Medicare benefits Protecting the Medicare program along with Social Security has been our key mission since our funding 25 years ago and remains our top priority today In fact these programs are critical lifelines to todays retirees and we believe they will be even more important to future generations But we also know that the cost of paying for seniors health care keeps rising even with Medicare paying a large portion of the bill That is why we at the National Committee support savings in the Medicare program that will help lower costs Wringing out fraud waste and inefficiency in Medicare is critical for both the federal government and for every Medicare beneficiary The Senate bill attempts to slow the rate of growth in Medicare spending by two to three percent or not quite 500 billion over the next 10 years However it is important to remember that the program will continue growing during this time Medicare will be spending increasing amounts of money and providers will be receiving increased reimbursementson a per capita basis every one of those years for a total of almost 9 trillion over the entire decade Even with the savings in the Senate bill we will still be spending more money per beneficiary on Medicare in the coming decades though not quite as much as we would be spending if the bill fails to pass Americas seniors have a major stake in the health care reform debate as the skyrocketing costs of health care are especially challenging for those on fixed incomes Not a single penny of the savings in the Senate bill will come out of the pockets of beneficiaries in the traditional Medicare program The Medicare savings included in HR 3590 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will positively impact millions of Medicare beneficiaries by slowing the rate of increase in outofpocket costs and improving benefits and it will extend the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund by five years To us this is a winwin for seniors and the Medicare program The National Committees urges you to oppose the motion to recommit the bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to strike important Medicare provisions from health care reform legislation Cordially Barbara B Kennelly President CEO 60 Plus Association From Wikipedia The 60 Plus Association is an American conservative advocacy group based in Arlington Virginia that bills itself as the conservatives alternative to the AARP formerly the American Association of Retired Persons Over the years it has sought to privatize Social Security end the federal estate tax and strengthen gun rights Current issues include opposing health care reform proposals opposing federal energy standards opposing the General Motors bailout and opposing tax increases on those earning more than 250000 per year 60 Plus is a member of the Cooler Heads Coalition an climate change denial organization According to the AARP the 60 Plus Association employed the talents of conservative direct mail mogul Richard A Viguerie to solicit new members The AARP has also criticized the 60 Plus Association as being partisan because its issues and causes mirror those of only one of the two major United States parties the Republicans A final criticism leveled by the AARP is that because it lists no duespaying members and receives the majority of its contributions from the pharmaceutical industry the group is simply a front organization for the pharmaceutical industry The organizations website provides positive reviews of its work by conservative politicians and commentators including The 60 Plus Association has helped provide the organization and momentum needed for repeal of the federal estate or death tax I commend the Association for its efforts to abolish this unfair and burdensome taxRep Ralph M Hall RTX Small business leaders recognize how counterproductive this tax really is Thats why they endorsed repeal of the death tax and why my bill is supported by the 60 Plus AssociationSenator Jon Kyl RAZ Jim Martin who by the way gave George W Bush his first political job is the head of Washington DCbased The 60 Plus Association and one of the countrys most vocal defenders of the tax rights of seniorsMona Lipschitz News Editor Talkers Magazine Sources Column March 2001 Leadership 60 Plus is led by its President James L Martin a 73year old veteran of the US Marines Martin has previously led several conservative advocacy groups and also was chief of staff for six years for former Republican congressman and senator the late Edward Gurney of Florida Martin also served as a member of President George W Bushs health and human services transition team Funding In 2001 60 Plus received a total of 275000 from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America the group Citizens for Better Medicare itself largely supported by the pharmaceutical industry and three drug companies Merck Pfizer and WyethAyerst plus another 300000 from Hanwha International Corp the US subsidiary of a Korean conglomerate with chemical and pharmaceutical interests amounts that made up about 29 percent of its revenue Were not a front for anybody James L Martin the chairman of 60 Plus told the AARP Bulletin I get money from lots of sources Ive received money from the pharmaceuticalsI wish it was more 60 Plus does not provide any explanation of its funding on its website In 2003 President Jim Martin told the British Medical Journal that 60 Plus had 225000 members whom he would not disclose for privacy purposes However according to the organizations IRS Form 990 91 percent of its 11 million in 2002 revenue came from one undisclosed source The Public Citizen watchdog group suspects that the pharmaceutical industry was that source According to the Washington Post in 2002 60 Plus received an unrestricted educational grant which can be used as most needed from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America As recently as 2001 60 Plus has not reported any member dues as revenue on its past tax returns reported the AARP Bulletin 60 Plus also earns income from sponsoring life insurance and health screening for its members Health Care Reform On August 7 2009 60 Plus released a TV ad to be aired on cable networks to inform viewers about the proposed US health care reform legislation Media Matters for America watchdog group found that the ad was largely false and used scare tactics to discourage voters from backing reform To publicize the ads launch 60 Plus issued a press release titled Massive Medicare Cuts Await Elderly Says New Ad From Seniors Group that read in part The healthcare proposal touted by the Obama Administration means massive Medicare cuts in order to pay for healthcare reform 60 Plus provided no evidence of these supposed massive Medicare cuts President I think it is pretty clear that the main organizations that care about seniors support this bill Another organization60 PlusI dont know what they think I guess they oppose it because they want to privatize Social Security and they get most of the money from the pharmaceutical industry I dont think they care about senior citizens frankly and certainly not as much as these other organizations I think it is also important to point out that this legislation is deficit neutral over not just the first 10 years but over the next 10 years It is more than deficit neutral This legislation generates a 130 billion surplus the first 10 years and as we all know reduces the budget by a quarter of GDP over the next 10 years So this is not irresponsible it is very fiscally responsible It is strongly supported by the senior organizations that care for seniors I might say too it is not raiding Medicare at all It is strengthening the Medicare trust fund and it extends the solvency of the trust fund Therefore I think clearly as AARP says we should oppose the MCCain amendment which hurts Social Security beneficiaries does not help them I yield such time as the Senator from Illinois needs President I think it is appropriate to remind people of some of the provisions that are in this bill To repeat because some people have listened to some of this debate and some have not and some might be tuning in right now the fact is without reform without this legislation Medicare is expected to go broke in the next 8 years That is according to the Medicare trustees report With this legislation that is extended for at least 5 more years That protects seniors This legislation protects seniors Without reform that is without this bill costs will rise and seniors will be forced to bear more and more of the burden out of their own pockets This legislation adds benefits for seniors It does not take it away as the other side implies Without reform seniors will struggle to afford prescriptions in the doughnut hole I remind my colleagues that this legislation will cut the cost of brandname prescription drugs in half for seniors during that gap the socalled doughnut hole It will also help provide more benefits in terms of annual wellness visits When seniors go to the doctor for a colonoscopy mammography or other preventive screenings they will not have copays as is currently the case today That is an added benefit this legislation provides for seniors Also this legislation helps seniors who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid with access to home communitybased alternatives A lot of our seniors would like that additional benefit That is all in this legislation This legislation provides more benefits for seniors not fewer This legislation protects seniors it does not harm them This legislation extends the solvency of the trust fund rather than not I might also sayand I think the Senator from Illinois made a very good pointcurrently seniors who are paying a Part B premium are really paying a 90 tax per year for those persons who are in Medicare Advantage We know Medicare Advantage is overpaid The Senator from Oklahoma Mr Coburn agreed with me when I asked him just yesterday if Medicare Advantage was overpaid He said yes it is overpaid by a very large margin This legislation can adjust that overpayment I might also say too that the groups I mentioned support this legislation But the main point I want to make is this There are so many fundamental provisions in this legislation that really have not come out much in debate a little esoteric but under the heading of delivery system reform We must begin to change the way we reimburse doctors and hospitals so we are focusing much more on quality of care rather than quantity of care Some of that is already happening in America without legislation Basically it is the nature of integrated systems We all talked about them I know Senators on the other side of the aisle also agree with this new trend where hospitals doctors nursing homes and other groups get together and they coordinate their care Their care is much more patient focused We have to move much more in that direction This will go a long way once it starts kicking init is going to take maybe 3 or 4 years to finally have an effecttoward eliminating the waste in our current system Estimates are we have between 200 billion to 300 billion to 800 billion annually in waste in the American health care system That is the reason health care costs are so high for family businesses governments whatnot We have to begin to get that under control and this legislation does that If we do not pass this legislation we will be postponing the day when we have to begin to get some of these excessive costs under control and then the problem will be much more difficult An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure in medicine It is also true in legislation Clearly now is the time to exercise a little ounce of prevention by starting to curb excessive costs and this bill does that When I was told about the handbook that is what I thought I was going to do is call up Medicare and say that is misleading and it is inaccurate because it is misleading and it is inaccurate How much time remains We might as well yield back our time and we can vote President I ask my colleague if he wishes to go first Whatever he wants to do It is his motion Unless we act today and pass health care reform the Medicare trust fund runs out of money in 2017 There are two ways to keep Medicare solvent find efficiencies so Medicare spends less or increase revenues going into the trust fundtwo ideas Our bill would make Medicare Advantage more efficient We would introduce competitive bidding We extend the trust fund for 5 more years That is in this bill Yes Medicare Advantage plans would not be overpaid as much but those plans could pay for greater efficiency by cutting their profits or cutting their executives pay They could do that Nothing says they have to go after beneficiaries Our bill does nothing to reduce the guaranteed Medicare benefits To the contrary our bill would improve Medicare benefits It would help seniors on the prescription drug doughnut hole and add new preventive benefits such as annual wellness visits The bill would help ensure doctors would be available to treat Medicare patients We would prevent the 21percent cut in doctor payments under current law For all those reasons the American Association of Retired Persons supports reform and opposes the MCCain motion I urge my colleagues to support reform and oppose the motion to commit With great considerable administrative costs and profits that otherwise could go to seniors Madam President I think it would be instructive to stop all this rhetorical talking past each other on Medicare Advantage and explain a little bit about how we got to where we are in this legislation I dont know the exact year but I think it was back in the 1980s sometime up to a certain point Medicare was basically paid fees for services That is the basic Medicare model The service was provided and there are certain set rates for that service Then in the 1980s private companies thought maybe they could be more efficient private insurance companies So they came to Congress and said We can do a better job in compensating Medicare based on fee for service so lets set up something called Medicare Advantage private entities So Congress said OK competition is a good thing So we did that Congress did that We basically set the rates to be paid to Medicare Advantage plans at 95 percent of fee for service After all the plan said they could do it more cheaply and they could compete So we said OK that sounds like a good idea We will pay you 95 percent of what otherwise would be paid under fee for service That continued for a while In 1997 the plan said Gee we need a little more money So Congress said All right And we gave a little more money to Medicare Advantage and basically said OK that will pay the 95 percent But if you are not doing so well and making money at 95 we will set kind of a higher floor according to certain areas of the country and you could choose whatever enables you to have the greatest compensation The big change occurred in 2003 in the Medicare Modernization Act otherwise known as the drug bill It was the legislation that created drug benefits for seniors As we all know frankly when Medicare was created it didnt have an outpatient drug benefit because drugs werent comparatively as important then as they are today Today there are miracle drugs that help in a lot of ways We created the drug benefit in 2003 The Congress did something else then Many Members of Congress were concerned that Medicare Advantage might not offer the plans in rural parts of America that there wouldnt be enough incentive for Medicare Advantage to go to rural America to offer the drug benefitsnot only the drug benefits but other benefits they provided Congress frankly gave a lot of money to Medicare Advantage plans so there could be at least two plans operating in all parts of the country Give them enough money and they will go that was the theory Guess what happened We gave them a lot of money and they went We have reached the point now where Medicare Advantage is by everybodys estimate quite dramatically overpaid as the Senator from Oklahoma Mr Coburn said when I asked him yesterday whether Medicare Advantage plans are overpaid He said Yes they are definitely overpaid MedPAC which advises us on Medicare reimbursement said to us that we are way overpaying Medicare Advantage plans I hear figures of from 14 to 18 percent overpayment It depends on what part of the country you are in Lets be conservative and say it is 14 percent in fee for service that they are overpaid MedPAC is an independent advisory group that helps us figure out what in the world we pay hospitals nursing homes home health agencies etc We are not the experts We need help MedPAC said to the Congress that we are overpaying them big time We decided lets figure out a way to reform the system How about a little competition Right now Medicare Advantage plans are paid what is called a benchmark depending upon the fee for service in their certain area We all know fee for service is much less in rural America and I am sure in the home State of the occupant of the chair Fee for service is much higher in other more urban States and so forth As it turned out under the benchmarks for fee for service they were way overpaying in States where fee for service is so high and not quite as much overpaid where fee for service is so low That is a nutty system in the current law today What we are doing in this legislation is basically we are saying Look lets introduce a little competition We are saying Lets get rid of the benchmarktype fee for service It is out of whack in different parts of the country What are we going to do We say OK we will divide the country into geographic areas In your area wherever you might be Uncle Samor Medicarewill pay the average competitive bid for that area The average cost you bid for that area is what we are going to pay which eliminates this big disparity between States and makes it much more fair so that reimbursement is based much more on what it actually costs in a certain area but it is competitively bid That is what we are trying to do Is that a good thing to do I think most of us think so Is it perfect I dont know for sure but we are trying our best to make this a better system a better program than we currently have As a consequence we are going to save some money and there will be competition Most of us think competition is often a pretty good thing That is what this is I remind my colleagues As a consequence we are not going to be overpaying Medicare Advantage plans anymore The amount we reduced the payment to is in line with what MedPAC says we should pay the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission We are trying to be responsible and reasonable with taxpayer money seniors who pay into Medicare The point is often made that gee this will hurt Medicare Advantage hospitals and so forth I think it is worth reminding all of us that a meeting occurred at the White House I think 4 to 6 months ago when all of the socalled providersthe hospitals insurance companies including Medicare Advantage plansall got together with the President and said Mr President we agree this country needs health care reform They all agreed Lets move back in history a little bit When President Clinton attempted health care reform all those groups were opposed to health care reform This time they are pretty much in favor of it because they know if we dont fix it it is going to collapse Back to that meeting What did they say They said Mr President we have all gotten together and we think we can contribute We can cut collectively 2 trillion in payments that go to us over the next 10 years That is what they said That is pretty interesting Thank you very much So we are working together to get health care reform Why do you think they would agree to 2 trillion They got their calculators out and got their financial officers together and said Gee if everybody has health careremember 46 million Americans dont have health insuranceif everybody had health insurance hospitals Medicare Advantage plans said Hey we can make some money because everybody has health insurance So that was the deal They will have a little lower margins but they will make it up on volume That is why they said to the President We can cut 2 trillion that otherwise would be reimbursements to us In this legislation did we reduce the rate of increase over 10 years by 2 trillion No Did we decrease the rate of increase in expenditures by half of that or 1 trillion No Do we reduce the rate of increase of health care expenditures down to say 450 billion close to 500 billion Yes that is what we did About onequarter of the industry said they could voluntarily contribute Are they squawking today No Why Because they got a pretty good deal They know they can continue to provide services and the hospitals are going to do well and home health care agencies will do well I will add that the profit margin for home health agencies is about 17 percent That is pretty good So we are cutting them a little bit The profit margin for nursing homesMedicare payments to nursing homesis about 15 percent We are cutting that a little bit But they are still making money and still will do well In fact their average rate of growth over the next 10 years is going to be in excess of 5 percent a year Wall Street analysts say these outfits are doing pretty well You dont see their stocks going down We are trying to do what is right and to reform Medicare Advantage as I just outlined it It is a pretty fair attempt at reform Also we will reduce payments to hospitals and other providers in an amount that they can live withnot be happy with but an amount they are OK with and where they know they can still make money That extends the solvency of the Medicare trust fund another 5 years because those providers are not being paid as much as they would otherwise be paid I hear Senators crying crocodile tears about how seniors are going to be cut and so forth Frankly with the changes we made I think it is very fair and it will extend the solvency of the trust fund There is not one dime of guaranteed Medicare benefits that will be cutnot one thin dimein this legislation It is true that because Medicare Advantagethe rate of growth of increase in Medicare Advantage plans is trimmed back a little perhaps there will not be as many extra benefitsnot the guaranteed benefits but extras fringe benefits like gym memberships and things like that Dont forget that is not because that is a decision made by Medicare or by Congress that is a decision made by the executive offices of these private companies I am not saying they should do this They could trim salaries overhead and they could have a little less return to stockholders and they could cut down administrative costs There are various things they could do which doesnt have to be passed on to reductions in fringes Lets keep things in perspective as to what is actually going on To be totally fair the other side likes to trot out this Medicare pamphlet that includes Medicare Advantage I think that is misleading and not accurate As the Senator says these are private plans Under this legislation we sayfrankly under the earlier Medicare Advantage plans HMOs had some coordinated care but the other half the private fee for service preferred provider organizations did not have coordinated care We are saying in the legislation that if you are in the Medicare Advantage plan which includes a whole list and you provide coordinated care we are going to give you a bonus When you see the operational effects as my good friend from Connecticut said This legislation if I may say expressly states there will be no reduction in what is called guaranteed benefits under Medicare No reduction whether it is under Medicare Advantage whether it is under fee for servicewhatever it is no reduction whatsoever To be fair to my good friend I used the words guaranteed benefits Guaranteed benefits are the usual benefits seniors think of when they are under Medicare They go to a doctor hospital so on We have given unfortunately so many additional dollars to the so called Medicare Advantage plansway above what they should have received MedPAC agrees Senator Coburn totally agrees they have been paid way too much They have taken advantage of that advantage by giving additional benefits in addition to the guaranteed benefits Those additionals are things such as gym membershipsa lot of extra stuff that frankly is not part of Medicare is not directly related to health I might say tooI have said this a couple three times and I will say it againa reduction in the increase of payments to Medicare Advantage the effect of those reductions is a decision made by the officers of that company They could take those reductions and apply them anywhere They could reduce their salaries They could reduce their admin costs They could take other actions that would reduce the rate of growth the rate of return of their stockholders They do not have to take it out of the beneficiaries That is their choice They do not have to That is according to analysis of Medicare Advantage plans from Oppenheimer Capital Fund dated November 12 of this year between 2006 and 2009 Their estimate is Medicare Advantage accounted for nearly 75 percent of the increase in gross profits among the larger Medicare plans in the industry Let me say this Medicare Advantage has been a huge driver Quoting from the Oppenheimer Capital Fund a huge driver of earnings growth for the industry in recent years Between 2006 and 2009 we estimate that Medicare Advantage accounted for nearly 75 percent of the increase in gross profits among the larger plans in the industry highlighted by an estimated gross profit increase of 19 billion in 2009 relative to commercial risk earnings gains That is basic health insurance not Medicare Advantage plans but basic health insurance of nearly 600 million Medicare Advantage probably wont be as much of a contributor in 2009 But it is going to be a very large contributor in 2009 because of advantages they get I might add too to remind us all this legislation provides additional benefits for all seniors including Medicare Advantage recipientsadditional benefits What are they No copayment for certain preventive caremammograms for example colonoscopies screening benefits that are not in existence today There are a whole host of other things that are additional This legislation provides additional benefits to Medicare Advantage members that are not there today When I say guaranteed benefits I am talking about the usual benefits seniors think of under Medicare It is hospital care it is nurses it is all medically necessary physician care diagnostic testing supplies It is home health care preventive care skilled nursing hospiceall the things that are basically related to health care The only thing that might be trimmed back a little is I call them the fringe stuff the excesses such as gym memberships I wish I had the whole list because some of them are not related As I said earlier they may not be cut They dont have to be It is up to the private companies whether to cut I have nothing against companies making profits They should make profits It is our responsibility as Senators to make sure the reimbursement rates Medicare pays providers are fair and reasonable and not excessive We have been told they are excessive So we are trying to find a way to make it fairer President I ask

S_DE_KAUFMAN,2009-12-03,2009_2009; 2009_2009,0135; 0136, President a few weeks ago the Department of Education released application guidelines for the Race to the Top competitive grant program I am very encouraged that these guidelines include a competitive preference for science technology engineering and mathematicsor STEMeducation I commend the Department for its foresight Throughout the year I have spoken many times about how important a focus on science and engineering is to our continued economic recovery Engineers and scientists have always been the worlds problemsolvers They will help us to solve the challenges of clean water lifesaving cures for cancer and disease clean renewable petrofree energy affordablehealth care and environmental sustainability Yet if we are to tackle these immense challenges we can no longer wait to begin training our Nations future STEM professionals until after they leave the K12 education pipeline That is why I am so pleased that the Race to the Top grant application emphasizes STEM education This is just the kind of attention STEM education needs The Race to the Top fund is designed to reward States that have been successful in raising student achievement and have superior plans to accelerate education reform State grant applications must of course focus on certain core education reform areas However an emphasis on STEM education is considered a competitive preference priority worth 3 percent of a States application score It is the only competitive preference in the Race to the Top application guidelines Applicants will earn all or none of the designated points thereby truly rewarding sound initiatives To meet this priority each State must offer a rigorous course of study in STEM education They are encouraged to collaborate with industry professionals universities research centers museums and other STEMfocused community partners Additionally each State must have a plan for preparing and assisting teachers in integrating STEM throughout the curriculum This includes offering applied learning opportunities and relevant instruction for students There are some successful STEM education programs already in operation throughout the country A study released by the National Academy of Engineering in September highlighted a handful of K12 engineering curriculum projects Other educationbased initiatives are also spurring interest among our youth For example there is a remarkable afterschool program in Wilmington DE that I recently spoke about here in the Senate It inspires high school students to pursue careers in STEM fields by teaching them how to build robots It is a great program All too often though these types of opportunities have not been available to all of our Nations students The Race to the Top grants will bring more opportunities to more students Perhaps the most important component for meeting this grant priority is that States plans must prepare more students to pursue college majors and careers in STEM They must also specifically address the needs of women and underrepresented minorities The United States cannot maintain its position as a technological leader nor can we solve the problems we face without a diversity of perspectives and participation Women constitute about half of the students in our higher education system about half of the overall workforce but they comprise only slightly more than 12 percent of the science and engineering workforce African Americans hold only 44 percent of science and engineering jobs Hispanics just 34 percent We can and must do better and the Race to the Top application guidelines are a step in the right direction Over 4 billion is available for competitive grants in the Race to the Top program This is an unprecedented level of discretionary funding for the Department of Education and States nationwide will be pulling out all the stops to earn their share of the pie Many States working months ago to put the correct conditions in place to apply for funds Moreover the Educate to Innovate campaign was recently launched by President Obama This campaign is a nationwide effort of private companies universities foundations nonprofits and science and engineering societiesworking with the Federal Governmentto improve student performance in STEM subjects As part of this effort business leaders and nonprofits will be joining forces to identify and replicate successful STEM programs across the country For example Time Warner Cable and the Coalition of Science After School are creating an online directory of STEM afterschool programs Other STEM organizations will be teaming up with local volunteers to host National Lab Days and President Obama announced an annual science fair at the White House This type of publicprivate collaboration is just the kind of action we need to bolster STEM education I sincerely hope the competitive preference for STEM education in the Race to the Top application coupled with the Educate to Innovate campaign will spur the kind of investment and attention in STEM education that I believe all of our students deserve Our country is counting on these future scientists and engineers President I am pleased to join the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and my colleagues to introduce an important piece of legislation the International Climate Change Investment Act of 2009 Climate change is a global issue and only a concerted international response can succeed This legislation provides key elements of an international deal that will both protect our planet and meet our Nations international responsibilities Even more importantly in these times it will open the door to a green economy that can create jobs here for the markets abroad for clean energy goods and services Successful global climate negotiations will create the opportunity for us to transform our own economy to free ourselves from dependence on fossil fuels from foreign sources and to create the jobs and markets for a new sustainable economy This legislation establishes a new framework for a global market in clean energy technologies A complete agenda to confront climate change will include support for our educational base and for the research development and deployment of clean technologies A climate deal that moves us away from fossil fuels will create global demand for those technologies Building capacity and encouraging dramatic change in other countries will create a pool of customers for Americas innovators That global market offers us the best chance to create a new economy based on a growing demand for clean energy goods and servicesand that will support job creation and profits here at home Companies in my home state of Delaware and across America are ready and eager to seize this opportunity for a worlds worth of new markets Our smartest investors agree This legislation shows the rest of the world that we are ready to do our part to make a smart effective and fair international climate change agreement work It sets us on a firm forward footing to lead the way in tomorrows green economy

eight clocka reasonable time instead of 1 am have been rejected by the other side President I will be a bit presumptuous here that I can speak for most Senators and probably most of the American people One thing in life that is so difficult to deal with is when you are working with somebody irrespective of a situation and trying to resolve an issue a problem and the person you are talking to or working with is not dealing in good faith When each side is dealing in good faith then each side will begin to recognize the merits of the other persons point of view and each person tends to recognize the deficiencies and faults of his own point of view It is a goodfaith exchange Not very many things in life are black and white and not many issues are black and white Most of them are some shade of gray I may think that even though my issuesI am not white and the other guy is black I like to think my shade of gray is more light than his shade of gray That is not relevant What works is when both sides talk to each other and try to make an accommodation I think I can safely say most Americans think our health care system needs some repair It is too costly There are too many cases when the insurance industry cherrypicks and takes advantage of people It is not the right thing to do Also we have to find a different way to pay for doctors and hospitals reimbursing on basic quality not quantity Almost all doctors agree we should move in that direction A few minutes earlier one Senator got up and said CBO has made this huge error a 12 trillion error He goes on and on about this 1 2 trillion error To be honest if we are going to deal in good faith we should mention the pluses and the minuses and let the Senators and the public figure out where all this nets out CBO has made many statements most of which I think the Democratic side has relied on and CBO has made statements that the Republican side has relied on It is not black and white It is a shade of gray In this case it is true that CBO sent a letter I think it was todayin fact I have it here with methat said they made a 12 trillion error in the second 10 years What was the error I dont remember the exact figure but essentially I think CBO said this legislation will reduce the debt in the last 10 years by I think it was 12 percent of GDP which comes out to about 13 trillion to the good It reduces the debt by 13 trillion CBO in a letter to us came back and said they made a mistake This legislation does reduce the Federal budget deficits over the subsequent 10 years but not by as much A 12 percent GDP should have been between a 14 percent GDP and 12 percent GDP Half the story is CBO said they made an error of 12 percent GDP But the full story is still nevertheless the Congressional Budget Office says All told CBO expects that the legislation if enacted would reduce federal budget deficits over the decade over 2019 relative to those projected under current lawwith the total effect during that decade that is in a broad range between onequarter and onehalf percent of GDP Essentially they are saying We made a mistake at CBO but still this is going to reduce deficits between 615 billion and say 13 trillion That is the full story I hope when we debate here that we give both sides of the story That way we can work more toward common ground what is right Nobody is totally right Each of us is here serving in good faith We want to do what is best for our people in our home States and we are trying Different States have different points of view We are going to get better solutions in health care reform if we talk to each other in good faith and give the whole story not just part of it President I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Colorado Mr Udall President I yield 10 minutes to the senior Senator from Michigan President reserving the right to object the doughnut hole will be filled I have made that promise Senator Reid has made that promise The White House made that promise When the bill is presented on the Presidents desk the doughnut hole will be filled but not in the way suggested by my friend from Iowa He is one of my best friends in the Senate and it is with regret that I must object Reserving the right to object and I will object we have been President just a couple three points here and I see the Senator from Ohio wishes to speak Several times during this afternoon Senators on the other side of the aisle in my judgment put on a little demonstration of trying to offer amendments They repeatedly asked consent to suspend the normal working of the cloture rule to offer amendments Earlier I note for the Record they slowwalked the process when an amendment was in order They wanted the whole amendment read And now they are trying to offer amendments again to slow down the process This is clearly a tactic to slow the process It is not part of the regular order That is clearly what is going on here Those were not despite the protestations to the contrary serious amendments Normally when a Senator offers a unanimous consent request they allow the other side to speak briefly on the subject at least on the reservation of the right to object That was not allowed here My colleagues did not allow me that courtesy earlier today to comment with a reservation of the right to object So I want to take a moment now to explain what they are really up to I could not because they would not give me the courtesy to say any words during the reservation That is why I made that statement I heard one Senator from the other side of the aisle complain that the majority is holding tonights vote at 1 am in the morning on the cloture motion Let me set the record straight The majority would be happy to have this vote earlier We would be happy to have this vote maybe in 10 or 15 minutes from now We would be happy to have this vote at a decent time It does not have to be at 1 am tomorrow It is the other side which is insisting that vote be at 1 am in the morning So it is they who are insisting on enforcing the letter of the Senate rules It is their right but it is also they who are insisting on delay I also want to put to bed some of the assertions that they claim this bill does not do real health care reform Let me mention a few health care reform provisions in this bill Mr President I do not know if you or any of my colleagues have read this second article in the New Yorker magazine by Atul Gawande The first article talks about two towns in Texas basically The second is basically looking to see whether this bill does reform health care and whether it does cut down health care costs It is an article I highly recommend to all of my colleagues in a recent issue of the New Yorker magazine But basically Dr Gawande concludes this bill includes all of the constructive provisions health care economists stakeholders and people who have studied this issue suggest should be part of health care reform That is his conclusion anyway I am happy he said that because we worked mightily to make sure we have all the provisions we can here to help constrain health care costs What are they Well onealthough some may disagree with the policyis an excise tax on highcost plans socalled Cadillac plans It is a bit debatable Last night I saw a TV ad where a group was advocating passage of this bill But just not my highcost plan Pass the bill but just not my highcost plan I understand the tenor and import of that TV ad but the main point is we do have to begin to limit to some degree the excessive cost of some plans and I think we are very fair and modest here in proposing an excise tax on those high cost plans The trick is to set the level at the proper level not too high not too low I think this bill does that In addition all the delivery system reforms this bill enacts with respect to Medicare are so important to improving quality and reducing excess costs We all know through history that when we reform Medicare and make changes in Medicare the private sector follows So the private commercial market will follow whatever Congress does with respect to Medicare and that is make good positive changes Why Because Medicare is such a large provider of care it tends to have a real effect on what other providers do What are some of those Well basically we start to change the way we pay doctors and hospitals that is we start to pay on the basis of value rather than volume that is quality rather than quantity The paradox of that is when people stop to think about it we are going to both cut down costs and increase value at the same time because we will be focused on quality When you focus on qualitynot just quantity not the whole volume of services but rather focus on qualityyou are going to get better quality but your costs are going to go down because you are not reimbursing things such as excessive MRIs excessive CAT scans excessive highcost procedures that do not in many cases get to the quality of health care but rather are very expensive and Medicare pays for them So we are moving more toward reimbursing based on quality and value than quantity What else is reform of the health care industry One is bundled payments and the sharedsavings program which we refer to as accountable care organizations This allows hospitals and groups to get together to cut down costs We have bundling in here which is another idea that moves along the same lines I might add too the CMS Innovation Center and the Independent Payment Advisory Board suggest some of these The bill makes it easier for employers to offer workplace wellness programs We give employers greater flexibility to offer premium discounts for workers who are committed to leading healthier lifestyles There is a lot of emphasis here on wellness and lifestyles We give incentives to employers to have wellness programs and preventive programs which will help obviously the worker but in addition to that cut down costs There are other provisions here This bill keeps getting stronger The socalled freshmen package led by Senator Warner will give the Secretary additional authority to expand delivery system reforms It expands the scope of the Medicare board to the private sector There are many other provisions in here The Nations employers through the leadership of the BRT played an important role in developing that package And the managers amendment included a provision that will provide greater access to Medicare data to measure performance It is no exaggeration to say that this bill will revolutionize health care But dont take my word for it The 23 economists who wrote to the President agree Mr President I ask unanimous consent that letter from these economists be printed in the Record There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows Stanford University Center for Health Policy Stanford CA November 17 2009 President Barack Obama The White House Washington DC Dear Mr President On behalf of my colleagues a group of distinguished economists I am pleased to transmit this letter regarding essential components of health reform legislation Sincerely yours Alan M Garber MD PhD Henry J Kaiser Jr Professor Professor of Medicine Professor of Economics Health Research and Policy and of Economics in the Graduate School of Business courtesy Director Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research and Center for Health Policy Stanford University November 17 2009 President Barack Obama The White House Washington DC Dear Mr President As the full Senate prepares to debate comprehensive health reform legislation we write as economists to stress the potential benefits of health reform for our nations fiscal health and the importance of those features of the bill that can help keep health care costs under control Four elements of the legislation are critical 1 deficit neutrality 2 an excise tax on highcost insurance plans 3 an independent Medicare commission and 4 delivery system reforms Including these four elements in the reform legislationas the Senate Finance Committee bill does and as we hope the bill brought to the Senate floor will dowill reduce long term deficits improve the quality of care and put the nation on a firm fiscal footing It will help transform the health care system from delivering too much care to a system that consistently delivers higherquality highvalue care The projected increases in federal budget deficits along with concerns about the value of the health care that Americans receive make it particularly important to enact fiscally responsible and qualityimproving health reform now In developing our analysis and recommendation we received input and suggestions from Administration officials including the Office of Management and Budget and others as well as from economists who disagree with the Administrations views The four key measures are Deficit neutrality Fiscally responsible health reform requires budget neutrality or deficit reduction over the coming years The Congressional Budget Office CBO must project that the bill be at least deficit neutral over the 10year budget window and deficit reducing thereafter Covering tens of millions of currently uninsured people will increase spending but the draft health reform legislation contains offsetting savings sufficient to cover those costs and the seeds of further reforms that will lower the growth of spending Deficit neutrality over the first decade means that even during the startup period the legislation will not add to our deficits After the first decade the legislation should reduce deficits Excise tax on highcost insurance plans The Senate Finance Committees bill includes an excise tax on highcost health insurance plans Like any tax the excise tax will raise federal revenues but it has additional advantages for the health care system that are essential The excise tax will help curtail the growth of private health insurance premiums by creating incentives to limit the costs of plans to a tax free amount In addition as employers and health plans redesign their benefits to reduce health care premiums cash wages will increase Analysis of the Senate Finance Committees proposal suggests that the excise tax on high cost insurance plans would increase workers takehome pay by more than 300 billion over the next decade This provision offers the most promising approach to reducing privatesector health care costs while also giving a much needed raise to the tens of millions of Americans who receive insurance through their employers Medicare Commission Rising Medicare expenditures pose one of the most difficult fiscal challenges facing the federal government Medicare is technically complex and the benefits it underwrites are of critical importance to tens of millions of seniors and Americans with disabilities We believe that a commission of medical experts should be empowered to suggest changes in Medicare to improve the quality and value of services In particular such a commission should be charged with developing and suggesting to Congress plans to extend the solvency of the Medicare program and improve the quality of care delivered to Medicare beneficiaries Creating such a commission will make sure that reforming the health care system does not end with this legislation but continues in future decades with new efforts to improve quality and contain costs Delivery system reforms Successful reform should improve the care that individual patients receive by rewarding health care professionals for providing better care not just more care Studies have shown that hundreds of billions of dollars are spent on care that does nothing to improve health outcomes This is largely a consequence of the distorted incentives associated with paying for volume rather than quality Health care reform must take steps to change the way providers care for patients to reward care that is better coordinated and meets the needs of each patient In particular the legislation should include additional funding for research into what tests and treatments work and which ones do not It must also provide incentives for physicians and hospitals to focus on quality such as bundled payments and accountable care organizations as well as penalties for unnecessary readmissions and healthfacility acquired infections Aggressive pilot projects should be rapidly introduced and evaluated with the best strategies adopted quickly throughout the health care system As economists we believe that it is important to enact health reform and it is essential that health reform include these four features that will lower health care costs and help reduce deficits over the long term Reform legislation that embodies these four elements can go a long way toward delivering better health care and better value to Americans Sincerely Dr Henry Aaron The Brookings Institution

excerpt from Dr Gawandes article from the New Yorker be printed in the Record There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows Excerpt From Gawande Article in New Yorker There are hundreds of pages of these programs almost all of which appear in the House bill as well But the Senate reform package goes a few USDAlike steps further It creates a center to generate innovations in paying for and organizing care It creates an independent Medicare advisory commission which would sort through all the pilot results and make recommendations that would automatically take effect unless Congress blocks them It also takes a decisive step in changing how insurance companies deal with the costs of health care In the nineteeneighties HMOs tried to control costs by directly overruling doctors recommendations through requiring preauthorization and denying payment the backlash taught them that it was far easier to avoid sicker patients and pass along cost increases to employers Both the House and the Senate bills prevent insurance companies from excluding patients But the Senate plan also imposes an excise tax on the most expensive Cadillac insurance plans This pushes private insurers to make the same efforts that public insurers will make to test incentives and programs that encourage clinicians to keep costs down President the Senator from Oklahoma at one point questioned the constitutionality of the mandate to buy health insurance I might say we thoroughly studied this issue I believe there is ample authority for Congress to enact such a provision under the Commerce Clause and also under the congressional authority to tax and spend for the general welfare provided for in the Constitution I might also add Prof Mark Hall of Wake Forest University has done an excellent survey article on this subject Mr President I ask unanimous consent that the conclusion of Professor Halls article found at a hrefhttpwwwoneillinstituteorgwwwoneillinstituteorga be printed in the Record There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows Legal Solutions in Health ReformThe Constitutionality of Mandates To Purchase Health Insurance By Mark A Hall JD Executive Summary Prepared by the ONeill Institute introduction Health insurance mandates have been a component of many recent health care reform proposals Because a federal requirement that individuals transfer money to a private party is unprecedented a number of legal issues must be examined This paper analyzes whether Congress can legislate a health insurance mandate and the potential legal challenges that might arise given such a mandate The analysis of legal challenges to health insurance mandates applies to federal individual mandates but can also apply to a federal mandate requiring employers to purchase health insurance for their employees There are no Constitutional barriers for Congress to legislate a health insurance mandate as long as the mandate is properly designed and executed as discussed below This paper also considers the likelihood of any change in the current judicial approach to these legal questions POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS Congresss Authority to Regulate Commerce The federal government has the authority to legislate a health insurance mandate under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution A federal mandate to purchase health insurance is well within the breadth of Congress power to regulate interstate commerce Congress can avoid legal challenges related to the 10th Amendment and states rights by pre empting state insurance laws and implementing the mandate on a federal level If Congress wants states to implement a federal mandate it has the following two options Conditional Spending Congress may condition federal funding such as that for Medicaid or public health on state compliance with federal initiatives Conditional Preemption Congress may allow states to opt out of complying with direct federal regulation as long as states implement a similar regulation that meets federal requirements Congresss Authority to Tax and Spend for the General Welfare Congress also has the authority to legislate a health insurance mandate under its Constitutional authority to tax and spend There are no plausible Tenth Amendment and states rights issues arising from Congresss taxing and spending power However Congress taxation power cannot be used in a way that burdens a fundamental right recognized in the Constitutions Bill of Rights and judicial interpretations by the US Supreme Court Since there is no fundamental right to be uninsured no fundamental rights challenge exists Other Relevant Constitutional Rights Challenges under the First and Fifth Amendments relating to individual rights may arise but are unlikely to succeed The federal government should include an exemption on religious grounds to a health insurance mandate as an added measure of protection from legal challenges based on religious freedom In the alternative the federal government can simply exempt a federal insurance mandate from existing federal legislation protecting religious freedom Considerations To avoid a heightened level of scrutiny in any judicial review the federal government should articulate its substantive rationale for mandating health insurance during the legislative process legal issues applicable law Commerce Clause Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce including local matters that substantially affect interstate commerce Health care and health insurance both affects and is distributed through interstate commerce giving Congress the power to legislate an insurance mandate using its Commerce Clause powers Taxing and Spending Power Congress has the power to tax and spend for the general welfare It can use its taxing power to implement a pay or play model to tax individuals that did not purchase insurance or provide tax benefits to those that do purchase insurance Congress can also use its spending powers to influence state action The taxing power of the federal government can be limited if a tax intentionally and directly burdens the exercise of a fundamental right Federalism The 10th Amendment and principle of state sovereignty in the Constitution prohibit the federal government from commanding the states to implement federal law or policies that would interfere with state sovereignty This is referred to as the anticommandeering principle A federal employer mandate covering state and local government workers appears consistent with existing Constitutional decisions but still might be susceptible to challenge under the Tenth Amendment Individual Rights The First and Fifth Amendment contain provisions that may have some bearing on a health insurance mandate Free Exercise of Religion The First Amendments Free Exercise Clause protects the free exercise of religion In addition the Religious Freedom Restoration Act RFRA prevents the federal government from enacting a law that substantially burdens an individuals exercise of religion unless the government has a compelling interest Due Process and Takings Clauses The Fifth Amendment includes two relevant provisions The Due Process Clause guarantees that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law The Takings Clause states that the government may not take an individuals property without just compensation CONCLUSION The Constitution permits Congress to legislate a health insurance mandate Congress can use its Commerce Clause powers or its taxing and spending powers to create such a mandate Congress can impose a tax on those that do not purchase insurance or provide tax benefits to those that do purchase insurance If Congress would like the states to implement an insurance mandate it can avoid conflicts with the anticommandeering principle by either preempting state insurance laws or by conditioning federal funds on state compliance A federal employer mandate for state and local government workers may be subject to a challenge however such a challenge is unlikely to be successful Individual rights challenges under the First Amendments Free Exercise Clause or RFRA are unlikely to succeed although a federal insurance mandate should include a statement that RFRA does not apply or provide for a religious exemption Fifth Amendment Due Process and Takings Clause challenges are also unlikely to be successful The legal analysis presented is likely to endure as the Supreme Courts current position and approach to interpreting relevant constitutional issues appear to be stable President the Senator from Oklahoma said the independent Medicare advisory board would ration care In fact he even accused us in the Congressmyself includedof voting against a prohibition on rationing But I might say I am not for rationing care in the sense that the Senator from Oklahoma talked about I do not think anybody in this Congress is We have to find a system that starts to control costs in a fair way that increases quality but also cuts costs That is the underlying premise of the delivery system reforms in this bill But do not just take my word for it Right here in the bill on page 1004 the bill says with regard to the advisory board The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration health care I chuckle a little bit when I say that because the Senator from Oklahoma is very concerned about using the word shall If he does not like shall then I suppose he means the board would have discretion But we say shall not include any recommendation to ration health care That is on page 1004 of the bill It is right there in black and white letters Read the bill The prohibition against rationing of health care is right there Mr President I see the Senator from Ohio who wishes to speak Reserving the right to object this is the fourth time today Senators on the other side Madam President it has been more than a month since the majority leader moved to proceed to the health care bill before us today This bill will provide real reform for our Nations flawed health care system This bill is the product of years of hard work study and deliberation in both the Finance Committee and the HELP Committeeand I mean yearsall transparent all aboveboard all out in the open In fact in the Finance Committee we initiated a new requirement that all amendments to the bill would have to be posted in advance on the Internet so everybody could know what they were the same with the bill itself The mark was on the Internet for a couple 3 days before we even went to markup It is unprecedented how open and transparent the process has been The same is true in the HELP Committee The culmination of these efforts has been the weeks of debate on this bill in the Senate These provisions have been in the public domain for a long time It is true there could be minor changes here and there but most of this has been in the public domain for a long time We have considered numerous amendments We have engaged in a full and healthy discussion The bill before us is fully paid for It is important to keep reminding colleagues over and over again This is fully paid for Dont take my word for it That is what the CBO said The American people trust and realize according to the Congressional Budget Office a nonpartisan organization that this bill is fully paid for It does not add one thin dime to the deficit You are going to hear others who dont have their own proposals just want to be negative want to try to shoot holes in this try to say it adds to the deficit That is their opinion That is not the opinion of the CBO CBO says it does not add one thin dime This bill will also reduce the Federal deficit in the short term and over the long term It reduces the Federal deficit We are so very concerned about deficits We in the Congress are and the country is We have to begin as soon as we can to start getting those deficits down and the national debt lowered This health care reform bill not only provides health insurance coverage and reforms the insurance industry dramatically it also takes the steps of lowering the deficit and lowering the longterm debt Let me quote from the Congressional Budget Office letter of yesterday CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation estimate that on balance the direct spending and revenue effects of enacting the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act incorporating the managers amendment would yield a net reduction in federal deficits of 132 billion over the 10year period A net reduction of 132 billion That is even better than the merged bill was just before we included the managers amendment That was a 130 reduction in the national deficit With the managers amendment according to the CBO there is a net reduction in the Federal deficit of 132 billion over the 10year period What about later Often people say Gee I hear you Senator you are taking care of things in the short term but you are enacting legislation that will have an adverse longterm effect That is what you guys do back there You hear that often Let me disclose what the Congressional Budget Office says about that This legislation will reduce the deficit markedly in the outyears Here is what the CBO says in a letter released today All told the Congressional Budget Office expects that the legislation if enacted would reduce federal budget deficits over the decade after 2019 relative to those projected under current lawwith a total effect during that decade that is in the broad range of between onequarter and onehalf percent of GDP What are they saying They are saying that in the second 10 years the deficit will be reduced between onequarter and onehalf percent of GDP That is between 630 billion and 13 trillion That is real money We are going to reduce the Federal deficit by this legislation alone Lets take the between 630 billion and 13 trillionroughly 1 trillion in the next decade That is important That is significant That is a good start The legislation before us will extend insurance coverage to more than 30 million Americans Think of that 30 million Americans who today do not have insurance will get health insurance That is so important I have forgotten the exact figure but I remember there was a Harvard study that concluded that 45000 Americans die every year because they have no health insurance Obviously people without health insurance die earlier at an earlier age Just for the sake of their own health it is good those people get health insurance let alone the benefit to hospitals by reducing uncompensated care This legislation will increase insurance coverage to more than 30 million Americans I have just been passed a note that people have a 40percent higher chance of dying without health insurance We are saying to those folks those 31 million Americans we are going to figure out a way so you have health insurance so you do not have that 40percent higher risk of death Here is what CBO says about coverage By 2019 the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation estimate that the number of nonelderly people who are uninsured will be reduced by about 31 million CBO goes on to say Under the legislation the share of legal nonelderly residents with insurance coverage would rise from 83 percent currently to about 94 percent That is 94 percent of the folks in our country excluding seniors because they have insurance under Medicare excluding them and excluding the unauthorized the total number of Americans who have health insurance will rise from the current number of 83 percent to about 94 percent This legislation will drive down premium costs for virtually all of us It will drive down premium costs for virtually all In an earlier letter the CBO indicated premiums would go down for roughly 93 percent of Americans under the underlying bill Premiums would go down about 93 percent for Americans I was going to put a table in the record but our rules dont allow us to put tables in so I summarized The conclusion of that summary is 93 percent of Americans will experience lower premiumsnot dramatic for some folks but nevertheless down and down is better than not down Insurance costs would go down significantly for those receiving tax credits in the new insurance exchanges It will protect consumers from harmful insurance company practices This is so important As you know no longer will insurance companies be able to deny coverage for those with preexisting conditions It is an outrage how much insurance companies deny coverage based on preexisting conditions We all hear stories many times if not from direct family members from friends of family who run into this It is so common especially in the individual market as people buy insurance for themselves Insurance companies deny coverage deny giving health insurance to somebody because of a preexisting condition It is wrong No longer will insurance companies be able to drop coverage for those who are sick That is very important too Companies often rescind willynilly They found something in the background of the person you didnt tell us about that so we are rescinding your policy That is not right That is just not right We prevent that from happening in this legislation It will also improve choice and competition in the insurance market We talk a lot about choice and competition This legislation provides more choice in choosing policies and more competition in the insurance market It will also create a true marketplace where plans compete on cost and quality rather than on their ability to cherrypick the healthiest among us It will represent the largest tax cut for American families that Congress has passed since 2001 This legislation includes the largest tax cut for American families that Congress has passed since that tax cut bill in 2001 the largest It is the tax credits people will receive to help them buy insurance That totals up I think to 440 billion I have forgotten the exact figures But this is the largest tax cut for American families since 2001 It will provide billions of dollars in tax credits to help families workers and small businesses to buy quality affordable health care insurance The managers amendment makes this good bill even better It will provide even more consumer protections against harmful insurance industry practices For example it will hold companies accountable for excessive premium rate increases It will require them to spend more on consumer benefits and less on administrative costs and profits That is new That is even better consumer protection compared with the underlying bill It will restrict the ability of health plans to impose annual limits on benefits That is new restricting the ability of health plans to impose annual limits on benefits It is wrong if you have an insurance policy that lo and behold the company says We didnt know you were going to be that sick so we stopped the benefits you can get annually and also lifetime We do both We restrict the ability of health plans to impose not only annual limits but also lifetime limits on benefits This managers package will ensure that companies cannot discriminate against children with preexisting conditions and do so right away beginning with plans that become effective midyear next year The preexisting condition restriction would ordinarily not take effect for a couple years but for children the preexisting condition prohibition will take effect right away There are other provisions to help people between now and 2014 There is highrisk pooling for example lots of different provisions in this bill which will help people get good benefits and protection very quickly This legislation will provide tax credits to even more small businesses The managers amendment will provide even more tax credits than the underlying bill These benefits will now be available right away in 2010 It is also a concern when will the tax credits for small business go into effectshouldnt they go into effect earlier Under this managers amendment these benefits will be available in 2010 This will also provide more health insurance choices through a new multistate option That option offers consumers the same health insurance Congress has todayno small matter It will extend extra funding for the Childrens Health Insurance Program for 2 additional years We are all very concerned about kids health care The childrens health care program has done a pretty good job This has been extended under the managers amendment for an additional 2 years It will do even more to control rising health care costs and reward even more providers for providing quality care to seniors through the Medicare Program It will invest 10 billion in community health centers They are so important community health centers for folks who need help right away and dont have insurance just need the care right away Especially in rural communities it will provide access to critical care where often that care is most needed These are the reforms which Americans have been waiting for for decades Americans are waiting for these changes They are waiting for these reforms and have been for a long time Decades may be an understatement Our health insurance system just doesnt do what it should for Americans the people we represent Finally we are taking a very significant first step to providing those reforms These are reforms American families workers and businesses desperately need They are reforms on which our economic stability depends That is no small matter either If we get our insurance costs under control that is more economic stability for everyone It is not just for families who dont know what the insurance company is or is not going to do it is for small businesses that dont know whether premiums will be up or by how much next year Why It is more economic stability for families and small businesses and soon more economic stability for budgets State budgets our Federal budget We need to get a little more control over all the excessive costs that are going up and also the volatility the yoyo effect that premiums have and outofpocket cost impositions have on people This will help them very significantly So by and large to be honestI know this sounds a little naive perhapsI do not know why this bill does not get an overwhelming endorsement This is a big vote on both sides of the aisle Then we can next year keep going from there add new provisions that need to be added correct mistakes that probably this legislation is going to have but work together because most Americans want us to work together back here They do not like us being partisan or political I must say this place is getting a little more partisan over the last couple years than it was earlier It is not what the American people want They want us to do our job do what is right This bill clearly is in the bounds of reasonableness of what is right and what is the right thing to do to get control of our health care system Again I hope we can get this passed by a large margin It will pass But I would like it passed by a large margin Madam President I now yield 20 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island Mr Whitehouse The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Rhode Island President I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Oregon President I wish to thank the Senator from Oregon for many reasons one of which is his kind words which are really appreciated but much more important than that his long dedication to health care reform He even worked for the Gray Panthers way back before he came here I remember the name Ron Wyden Gray Panthers a good number of years ago Then lo and behold both Houses of Congress togetherwe worked together on reforming Medigap coverage It was an outrage Today we talk about medical loss ratios of maybe 80 percent 85 percent up to 90 percent and so forth I can remember back when it was an outrage the degree to which Medigap insurance coverage had medical loss ratios of not 80 percent not 70 percent not 60 percent it would be below 50 percent Insurance companies were selling insurance to seniors trying to cover that gap between what Medicare would and would not cover and just tragically low embarrassingly low outrageously low medical loss ratios Senator Wyden and I got together and got legislation passed to reform the Medigap marketto make Medigap insurance plans more fair They were ripping seniors off there was no doubt about it and we got that changed Now on health care reform an ardent advocate of more competition more choice in our health care systemit is clear we need more competition It is clear we need more choice On the competition side in many of our States we find there is only one or two insurance companies that dominate the entire State That is very true around our country There is just not the competition there should be In addition there is not the choice A lot of employees would like to have more choice among insurance companies in their kinds of policies and so on and so forth We have a system where most employees are tied to their employer it is pretty much insurance coverage the employer offers If we were starting from scratch maybe 20 30 40 60 maybe 80 years ago we may not have had such an employerbased system as we have today Our current Tax Code also tends to encourage excessive insurance coverage because of our employerbased system Anyway I am digressing Senator Wyden got us thinking a lot earlier about the problems that caused and frankly I think he is right I think a lot of Americans think he is right You can only take things a step at a time here and we are probably not going nearly as far as the Senator from Oregon wishes to go But I thank him He is there he is dogged and he works hard on behalf of seniors He is an advocate of American consumers respected by health insurance companies not letting the companies take advantage of citizens I thank the Senator for that I do not see any Senators on the floor on our side If there were it would be a good time for them to speak Pending the arrival of the Democratic Senators let me say a few things about small business Clearly one of the goals of health care reform is to ensure that employees of small businesses have good quality affordable health care options We all know that is clear I have talked to small businesspeople I will never forget a conversation I had with a logger who has four or five or six people working for him It was about 2 or 3 years ago I asked him if he had health insurance He said yes for his familyhis wife and himself I asked How about your employees He said no he didnt You could tell he wanted to and he wasnt just blowing smoke He clearly wanted to provide insurance for his employees but it just pained him because it was too expensive We all hear stories like that they are legion I can remember talking to another small businessman in my State of Montana a contractor who has 5 6 8 10 people working for him He is just beside himself because the insurance company told him his premiums are going to go up 40 percent next year He said Max I cant deal with that I asked Why are they going up 40 percent He said Well they found a preexisting condition with respect to one of my employees He said Max I was beside myself I cant afford a 40percent increase They said it would only be a 20percent increase if I let him go But he has been with me 15 20 years and is one of my best employees I cant let him go He found another carrier and kept his employee So he did find another insurance carrier but he had to pay about a 20percent increase in premiums He was able to keep his employee but that is just wrong It is so hard for small businesses to provide health insurance to their employees I know it is a trite thing to say but most jobs in our country are created by small businessmen That is where most of the jobs are and it is where most of the creativity is That is in many cases where the greatest need is to help encourage entrepreneurism American ingenuity and where a small businessperson can do a good job with the service he is providing Last year 62 percent of small businesses did offer health insurance to their employees Compare that with other companies that have say 200 employees Among all companies in America that have 200 or more employees 99 percent of them have offered their employees health insurance Contrast 62 percent of small businesses offer health insurance and 99 percent of businesses with more than 200 employees offer health insurance Among the very small businesses in our country it is lower lower than 69 percent Now it is only 49 percenta very small number of employeesthat have health insurance through their small business employer There are clearly very significant reasons for that There are barriers that prevent small businesses from finding affordable health insurance options What are they Small businesspeople tell us the main reasonat least one of them is that the premiums are just too high I mentioned an example of the contractor I talked with in my State who said they are going to charge a 40percent increase in premiums as further evidence that premiums are too high It is understandable that is one of the main reasons small businesses cant get health insurance In the past 10 years premiums have risen 82 percent for single workers and 93 percent for families employed by small business virtually doubled premiums in the last 10 years if you are a single person and work for a very small business That is not true for big business As health care costs rise small businesses are forced to make workers pay a greater portion of these expensive premiums In 2008 for example employees at small businesses that did provide health insurance paid more than twice what they paid just 8 years earlier twice as much The low rate of offering and higher costsharing responsibilities for employees in small businesses often limit the ability of small businesses to attract and retain employees That is why the health care bill before us includes many provisions to make quality coverage for small business more affordable not only for the businesspeople but for their employees Before the managers amendment the bill did include 24 billion in tax credits to help small businesses and charitable organizations purchase health insurance for their employees The managers amendment dedicates additional billions to providing tax credits to small businesses to make health insurance more affordable The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation which I know is near and dear to the heart of the Presiding Officerafter all they are an independent arbiter They can tell us with objectivity what this legislation is or is notthey estimate that the tax credit for small businesses will provide 40 billion in tax relief to small businesses over their first 10 years In addition we start the tax credits a year early that is we start them in 2010 In the earlier bill it was 2011 In the managers amendment we start in 2010 right away This means that in just over a week after the legislation is passed and signed into law eligible small businesses will be able to receive tax credits to help them buy health insurance for their employees This expansion of the tax credits means eligible small businesses will now be able to receive up to 6 years of tax credits So now starting in 2010 eligible small businesses will receive tax credits worth up to 35 percent of the employers contribution to employee health insurance plans35 percent Then in 2014 it is even better Eligible small businesses will receive tax credits worth up to 50 percent of the employers contribution to employee health insurance plans purchased in health insurance exchanges The employer would get 50 percent of the cost of the health insurance that would be available for credit that is the employer can credit 50 percent subtract from his income taxes 50 percent of the cost of insurance What do you have to do to qualify Businesses must cover at least 50 percent of employee premium costs If you cover half the employee costs you get to subtract your half from your income taxes The value tax credit is based on the size of the business and the average wage paid to its employees The managers amendment strengthens the assistance to small businesses by expanding the small business tax credit In the managers amendment the tax credit will be available to small businesses with fewer than 25 employees and less than 50000 average annual wages And the full value of the tax credit is now available to small businesses with 10 or fewer employees and 25000 or less in average annual wages It moved up from 20000 to 25000 so more small businesses can qualify and take advantage of that tax credit By expanding the wage thresholds which I just described more small businesses will be able to claim the tax credits And tax credits will phase out more slowly as wages increase This was a high priority for small businesses We recognized that and responded to it The small business tax credit will help make insurance affordable for many small businesses In 2011 42 million Americans will be covered by quality affordable health coverage 42 million Americans will be able to take advantage of this On average small businesses across the country would receive a new tax credit of about 4900 to help them purchase insurance That is per employee 4900 to help them purchase insurance for their employees The CBO estimates that the small business tax credit will help lower insurance costs by 8 to 11 percent for the employees of small businesses receiving the credit Let me say that again CBO estimates that the small business credit will help lower insurance costs by 8 to 11 percent for the employees of small businesses who receive their credit Without the small business tax credit many people would have to buy insurance through the exchange on their own without the benefit of a contribution from their employer One of the reasons many small businesses are currently unable to afford health insurance is because small businesses lack the buying power larger companies have to negotiate affordable group rates The Senate bill creates small business insurance exchanges known as SHOP exchanges where small businesses can band together and pool their risks which will enhance their choice and buying power These State based exchanges will be a critical tool to help small businesses with fewer than 100 employees shop for health insurance plans and determine their eligibility for tax credits to buy health insurance Small businesses that prosper and grow beyond 100 employees would be allowed to continue shopping through the exchangespooling The insurance plans sold in SHOP exchanges would be subject to the same transparency requirements and consumer protections so small businesses can feel confident they are purchasing highquality plans that will provide quality affordable coverage for their workers The legislation also institutes reforms in the insurance market that will protect individuals and small businesses purchasing plans both inside and outside these SHOP exchanges These reforms will stop insurance companies from denying coverage based on a persons preexisting health condition or increasing a persons health insurance premiums based on health status or on gender and occupationa practice that just has to be stopped These new regulations are essential to helping small businesses keep health care costs predictable from year to year That is one of the big problems Small businesses face this sea of chaos of volatility uncertainty unpredictability in knowing what their insurance costs will or will not be That is why insurance companies cherrypick and take advantage for themselves to maximize their profits but it has the opposite effect on small businesses This will help frankly to buy a lot more certainty that we desperately need The changes in the managers amendment will go the extra step and ensure this bill provides small businesses with the help they so desperately need Passing health care reform is critical to small businesses Without reformthis is no small matter I am not blowing smoke herewithout reform many small businesses will be forced to drop their health insurance coverage they may already have because they can no longer afford it They cannot afford the increase in premiums This will leave many employees to fend for themselves in the individual market We know without this bill passing how unfair the individual market is to people Many of the provisions in this bill were designed with small businesses in mind The bill gives small businesses access to a reformed marketplace where they will have improved buying power to negotiate rates And the Senate bill provides tax credits to help small businesses buy health insurance for their employees Data from CBO tells us that these reforms will make coverage more affordable for millions of small business employees The small business tax credit will help reduce health care costs for small businesses and their employees As a result of the larger health reform proposals in the bill there will be an increase in the percentage of small firms that offer health insurance coverage We must act to help small businesses access to quality affordable health care options for their employees Too many small businesses around the country are waiting Will the Senator yield for one brief minute Will the Senator yield so I can show him He doesnt For the sixth time we are engaged in this stunt so I object Will my colleague yield on that point I wish to ask my colleague who knows the Senate procedures so very well why are we having a 1 am vote Isnt it possible it could be a different time President reserving the right to object as enticing as that might sound I object 
S_IL_DURBIN,2009-12-20,1997_2009; 1997_2009; 1997_2009; 1997_2009; 1997_2009; 1997_2009; 1997_2009; 1997_2009; 1997_2009,1010; 1004; 1005; 1003; 1006; 1007; 1008; 1009; 1011, What the Senator from Oklahoma says is What the American people ought to pray is that somebody cant make the vote tonight Thats what they ought to pray I do not think it is appropriate to be invoking prayer to wish misfortune on a colleague I want him to clarify that I have invited him I tried to reach out to him He is my friend and I have worked with him But this statement goes too far The simple reality is this We are becoming more coarse and more divided It is understandable we would disagree on political issues That happens all the time But unfortunately we have allowed that political disagreement to spill over into our personal relationships and friendships and that does hurt this institution We rely on one another on both sides of the aisle so much I would say from the start that Senator Reid has offered the Republican side of the aisle accommodations and asked we try to do things that might help the families and individuals in the Senate and we have not had any luck to date Hope springs eternal I hope Senator Coburn can make it to the floor to explain his statement Earlier this week there was a prayercast involving several SenatorsI did not hear it I only heard references to itwhere they were actually in a group praying for the defeat of this legislation on health care reform It is their right to do that I can recall as a high school football player saying a prayer my team would win a football game I dont know if God had any time to worry about my little football game But when it reaches a point where we are praying asking people to pray that Senators wont be able to answer a rollcall I think it has crossed the line I hope my friend and colleague from Oklahoma will come and explain exactly what he meant I wish the bill before us were different I wish it had a strong public option I wish it offered Medicare to people 55 years and older I wish it eliminated the MCCarranFerguson antitrust exemption for health insurance companies Unfortunately it does not do those things My disappointment over those elements should not lead me to conclude this bill is wanting or bad The opposite is true We have to look to the positive side of what this legislation will do This health care reform will extend the reach of health insurance coverage to 30 million more Americans I see on the floor this evening my colleague from Arizona He and I were on a television show early this morning I am sure we got great ratings because the public cant wait to hear us but during the course of that television show the Senator from Arizona expressed concern that 20 million Americans would not be covered by our bill Interesting isnt it Today 50 million Americans are not insured 50 million Americans are uninsured This bill will provide insurance for 30 million more meaning 94 percent of Americans will have coverage the highest percentage in the history of our country The Senator from Arizona says it does not go far enough to include more people We have waited patiently now for 21 days during the course of this debate on health care reform for the Republican plan for reforming health care It has never been produced Promised but never produced I think the reason is obvious It does not exist Several times they have said on the floor We have a plan and they will wave a bill at us When the Republicans had a chance over a 3week period of time to offer their substitute they never did In fact in over 20 days of active debate on the floor there were exactly four Republican amendments on health care reform Four in 20 days 1 every 5 days At that rate how long would the Republicans have us stay on the floor waiting for the next amendment That is the reality They offered six motions to stop the debate remove the bill from the floor and send it back to committee Of course when it came to actual substantive amendments changing sections of the bill they would not do it So the Republicans have come up empty They are running on empty when it comes to health care reform which means this task of writing a bill is either beyond their pay grade or beyond their will and they like the system as it exists I do not Fifty million uninsured Americans is unacceptable in this country I think we have to reach a point where we move forward with 30 million now and then find ways to bring in the additional 20 million Remember when Social Security was enacted into law with the resistance of the Republicansthey resisted it saying it is too much governmentthe safety net extended to widows We extended in years that followed Social Security protection to dependents survivors and the disabled and we added a costofliving adjustment It was not the end of Social Security in the 1930s In the years that followed we built on the original bill and we will build on this original model of health care reform The same thing is true under Medicare Medicare as originally offered did not cover disabled people It did not provide home health care therapy or prescription drugs Over the years we added those benefits I believe this is an important starting point I also think it is important we provide insurance protection for Americans When it comes right down to it too many people are denied the therapies the surgeries the medications their doctors recommend because some clerk in an office at a health insurance company is instructed to just say no and they say no repeatedly We also make sure that patients are first even with our additional amendment guaranteeing the right of people to pick their doctor and keep their doctor It is a patientfirst approach that we are using on this bill We hold the health insurance companies accountable and say if they turn around and gouge the patients before they want to be part of the insurance exchange they can be disqualified We saw what happened with credit card reform When the banks had their way after the passage of credit card reform and during the period before it went into law they ran up the interest rates on credit cards I got letters in the mail from American Express and others saying Incidentally because of the new Federal law we are going to raise your interest rate on your credit card over 20 percent We know some of these merchants given enough time will capitalize on that time and try to exploit that system Our bill is going to go after them The medical loss ratio is an important part in the bill I am sure the health insurance companies are not going to be happy with it It says Stop taking those premium dollars and turning them into administrative expenses advertising bonuses for CEOs highpaid salaries Take the money and pay for medical services for the people you insure If you do not if you take too much of this money for profiteering you are going to have to rebate it to your customers It is changing the balance giving customers a chance when it comes to health insurancesomething that is long overdue We extend the health care safety net in this bill Mr President 18 million people in my home State of Illinois will have access to affordable health insurance I have met them They are hardworking people small businesses parttime employees unemployed peoplenone of them has health insurance Again 18 million in my State of almost 13 million are going to have the chance to be covered We will have 10000 more community health centers I cannot tell you what an exciting idea this is If you visit a community health center in Arizona or Illinois you know what I am talking about This is a clinic in a neighborhood usually or small town where people can literally walk through the front door and get access to primary care physicians who will help them through their medical difficulties They do not have to wait until they are so bad they end up in an emergency room where costs are dramatically higher They have a doctor a nurse a medical professional a dentist right there in their community We estimate this bill will add 10000 more community health clinics across the United States That is going to be a dramatic change It also will create the opportunity for 20000 more primary care physicians across America If there is anything more we need it is family care internists who can deal with the medical needs of people before they are referred to a specialist or before their situation has deteriorated This bill is going to provide for all people under 133 percent of povertythat is about 29000 for a family of fourthe security of knowing they are under Medicaid protection without health insurance costs without health insurance premiums We will say to those working poor people You are going to have health insurance We also believe that progress is going to take some time I recall that Senator Teddy Kennedy who I wish were here for this great battle for which he prepared for four decades said in his book True Compass toward the end that real reform is never over It is not This is a beginning It is an important beginning It establishes important principles I say to the critics we dont expect every aspect of this bill to work perfectly It is an imperfect product made by mere humans trying to do their best But some of the things in this bill are going to dramatically change health care in America for the better We are going to find ways to deliver quality care to people in a costeffective way We are going to change parts of our system today which unfortunately under this current system are out of control The costs are out of control Moving coverage to an additional 30 million people 94 percent of Americans under coverage something no other bill from either side of the aisle has proposed reducing our deficitincidentally we now have a CBO statement which makes it clear that the budget savings in the second 10 yearsthe first 10 years is 130 billion the second 10 years is up to 13 trillion They qualified it but it still is the most dramatic deficit reduction bill in the history of the United States There has never been a bill that has come before us that reduces our deficit so dramatically It reduces it because it works It brings down the cost of health care As far as Medicare is concerned this bill will add at least 9 years of life to Medicare Medicare which is going to face serious financial problems in about 7 or 8 years has a new lease on life with this bill of 9 or 10 years To say this saves Medicare and puts it on sound footing is a fact that has been confirmed by the Congressional Budget Office all the speeches on the floor notwithstanding This bill is also going to move us forward in the whole area of looking at ways to deal with medical negligence and medical malpractice We provide incentives and grants to States to find ways without penalizing the true victims of medical malpractice to reduce the incidence of lawsuits to reduce defensive medicine That is a conscientious and thoughtful way to approach this I would say if I were to ask anyone to offer a prayerand I dont do that very oftenI would say a prayer for the 50 million uninsured Americans folks who go to bed without peace of mind that they have health insurance for themselves and their families I would say a prayer for those turned down by health insurance companies when their doctor says they need a certain therapy or a certain medication or a certain surgery Those are the people I think of I pray good fortune for them I do not pray for misfortune for anyone in the Senatenot for any of my colleagues not for any of my political opponents I do not think that is appropriate use of prayer to do that I am sorry as I bring this to an end that the Senator from Oklahoma has not been able to come to the floor I have tried now on several occasions through the cloakroom and other ways to invite him to come and explain his remarks I am troubled when he says the American people ought to pray that somebody cant make the vote tonight I pray for everybody I dont pray for misfortune for anyone in the Senate Lets have the vote Lets have all 100 Senators here voting their conscience voting their heart Mr President I yield the floor The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Illinois There have been four substantive amendments offered by the Republican side They have had ample opportunity to call for this The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Objection has been heard Madam President I thank the majority leader for designating that I should control half the time between now and 130 I would like to first thank all the people who are here the staff and the pages This has been a tough session for many but tougher for many of them than some Members of the Senate because many times they have had to wait until the very last Senator of either political party has finished for the day before they go home I was reflecting on that yesterday afternoon in the midst of one of the toughest historic snowstorms in Washington DC that hundreds of staff people were waiting at their post doing their jobs on a Saturday in the middle of a snowstorm when virtually every business around Washington was closing down I wish to thank them and the pages on both sides of the aisle for their patience and commitment to this great country and this great institution Why are we here on Sunday Why were we here on Saturday Why are we going to take a vote at 1 in the morning on Monday Good questions and I am not sure there are satisfying answers But there are answers We are here because we are trying to finish health care reform It has been a project that has been underway for almost a year now since the President challenged us to do something and a lot of effort has been expended on both sides of the aisle But I will say I can speak for our side of the aisle Senator Max Baucus came to me more than a year ago and sat down in my office to talk about health care reform He was preparing for this battle as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and knew he would play a central role gathering the opinions of members of his committee and Members of the Senate Efforts were underway with Senator Kennedy from his remote location in Massachusetts recuperating from surgery and from cancer therapy trying to keep his committee on track toward health care reform He turned over that mantle to Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut who did an admirable job with the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee They prepared for and had hearings They entertained hundreds of amendments In fact I believe there were over 160 amendments that were proposed by the Republicans and many of them were adopted in the HELP Committee Senator Coburn of Oklahoma filed 212 amendments during the HELP Committee markup He offered 38 amendments to the bill Nineteen of his amendmentshalf of themwere agreed to Of those that were offered 15 were not agreed toall by rollcall vote So 13 amendments offered by the Senator from Oklahoma were included in the bill that is before us today He has questioned whether the current procedure gives him an opportunity to offer amendments The fact is we are now on our 21st day of considering health care reform Exactly 4 amendments have been offered by the Republican side of the aisle 4 substantive amendments to change provisions in this bill of 2000 pagesin 21 days 4 amendments They offered six motions to stop the debate send the bill back to committee They were generic motions They did not ask for specific changes They just take on an issue in the bill and say Send it back to the committee and tell them to solve this problem and then bring it back to the floor at a later time Well that is kind of a procedural and if I might say political statement more than a substantive statement about a provision in the bill So exactly four amendments have been offered by the Republican side of the aisle that deal with substance Some of their efforts have been in protection of the health insurance industry particularly a program called Medicare Advantage which was created by private health insurance companies to prove to government they could provide Medicare more cheaply Some did but most did not and now we are paying up to 17 billion a year subsidizing private health insurance companies that told us at the start We will save you money It turns out they are costing us money a lot of moneyand many of us think it is wasteful We would rather have that money spent on basic Medicare making certain there is solvency in Medicare and a good strong future So when you look at the state of the situation we are now on a cloture motion to bring a close to the debate on health care reform after almost 3 weeks and four Republican amendmentsonly four were offered There never was a Republican substitute no Republican proposal for health care reform We have been told this might exist We have never seen it Of the four amendments they offered not one was this substitute that was going to deal with the health care system It is a promise that has not been kept They kept saying It is coming Pretty soon we are just going to put this thing right in the Record Well it never happened In 3 weeks it never happened It is hard work to prepare a substitute The reason this took so long and has dragged on for so long is we had to take every page of this and turn it over to the Congressional Budget Office They sit there with their economists pore over it and say Well is it going to add to the deficit or reduce the deficit Is it going to reduce health care costs What is the impact It takes them some time to do that The Republicans know if they are going to have a substitute it will have to go through the same rigorous appraisal and they have not done that I think because it is hard In fact from their political point of view it might be impossible to try to solve the problems facing health care in America without taking the path we have taken What does this bill do The basics are obvious Firstand this is all backed up by the Congressional Budget Officeit will reduce the cost of health care It will make it more affordable A health care policy for a family of four offered by an employer on average cost 6000 10 years ago Today it costs 12000 a year It has doubled in 10 years and in 8 years it will double again to 24000 We have to slow this down or it will reach a point where more and more people will be uninsured fewer businesses will offer health insurance and more individuals will find themselves unable to afford the basic protections they need for themselves and their families So the Congressional Budget Office tells us we reduce the growth in the cost of health care and that is a good thing They came through with a dramatic revelation yesterday when they said this bill will reduce our deficit as well If the cost of health care goes down the cost of health care programs offered by government goes down They tell us in 10 years we will save 130 billion from the deficit That is a dramatic savingsthe largest in history But then the news got better They said in the second 10 years instead of saving 650 billion from our debt and deficit it could reach double that amount 13 trillion in savings in the second 10 years I would say to those who give speeches day after day about our deficit I invite youin fact I challenge you to come up with a bill that does this that gives us actual savings of 130 billion in 10 years and 13 trillion in the next 10 years It is hard to do It may be impossible for some to come up with such a bill This bill also will extend the coverage of health insurance so 94 percent of Americans will have coverage Madam President 30 million Americans today who have no health insurance will have health insurance under this bill Half of them are poor enough that they will receive Medicaid the other half will qualify for the insurance exchanges and other tax credits to help them pay their premiums so they can have and afford health insurance Ninetyfour percent of Americanswe have never ever achieved a level of insured Americans that reached that number Thirty million Americans will be receiving health insurance at the end of the day This bill will start giving consumers across America protections they need against abuses from health insurance companies One of the things near and dear to my heart about this amendment which has been criticized by some is this amendment which was offered yesterday has been on the Internet for those who are interested to read it for 24 hours and will continue to be available This amendment says that as soon as this is signed health insurance companies across America cannot deny coverage to children those under the age of 18 because of a preexisting condition That means if your son or daughter is diagnosed with diabetes juvenile diabetes and you find it difficult to get health insurance today because of that preexisting condition they will no longer be able to discriminate against your child and your family because of this bill That is one thing There are many others This whole notion of health insurance companies waiting until you get sick and cut you off when you need them the most that comes to an end under this amendment in 6 months So over and over again we give consumers across America a chance to have the coverage they paid for when they need it the most We used to call it the Patients Bill of Rights and it used to be bipartisan It was Senator Kennedy and Senator MCCain who brought it to us and it failed because the health insurance companies were so politically powerful But we have got them this time If we can pass this bill we finally have the protections the American people so desperately need There are other provisions in the bill Right from the beginning we provide more help to small businesses These are businesses with 50 25 employees and an average payroll of 50000 an employee to 25000 an employee or less For each of those businesses we say We are going to help you buy health insurance for the owners of the business as well as for the employees Those are the folks who are struggling and losing coverage people such as the realtors in your hometown Did you know one out of four realtors in America has no health insurance I did not know it until they came to see me Well this gives them a hand It gives them a tax break as a small business to provide health insurance for their people I am going to reserve the remainder of my time I will tell you we are here today We are burning the hours off the clock to vote at 1 am in the morning It would be more humane to the people who work here to the Members of the Senate and their families for us to reach a gentlemanly and gentlewomanly agreement that we will have this vote at a more reasonable time If we have the 60 votes which I think we have the commitments for then we can decide how to move forward We have had a long arduous and sometimes taxing debate leading to this moment I think it is time for a vote The sooner we can reach that vote the sooner the American people will know that we will either succeed or fail in bringing stability and security when it comes to their health insurance making that health insurance more affordable extending the reach and protection of health insurance to record levels of Americans making sure we have health insurance reform as part of this and at the same time at the very same time reducing our deficit I reserve the remainder of our time The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Who yields time Madam President how much time do I have remaining The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore There is 1 minute 50 seconds Madam President I wish to suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time under the quorum be allotted equally to both sides The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Without objection it is so ordered The clerk will call the roll The assistant bill clerk Sara Schwartzman proceeded to call the roll President would the Senator yield for a question I am going to be speaking at the end of this hour that has been allocated to our side and I dont want to interrupt the Senator from Ohio but for one reason I dont know if the Senator from Ohio heard or is aware of a statement made earlier today by our colleague from Oklahoma Senator Coburn who came to the floor and said What the American people ought to pray is that somebody cant make the vote tonight That is what they ought to pray I have been trying to reach Senator Coburn because he is on a committee on which I serve and I work with him This statement troubles me I am trying to reach him to come back to the floor and explain exactly what he meant about a Senator not being able to make the vote tonight I dont know if the Senator from Ohio is familiar with this statement but I am reaching out to Senator Coburn I will be on the floor in the next 45 minutes and I hope he will join me I thank the Senator from Ohio for yielding I wish to renew my invitation to Senator Coburn to please come to the floor but do it soon before my time expires I called his office to make sure he knew I was trying to reach him I have spoken on the floor to alert the Republican side that I wished to ask him to explain a statement he made on the floor earlier today The statement of Senator Coburn of Oklahoma said What the American people ought to pray is that somebody cant make the vote tonight Thats what they ought to pray I am troubled by this statement I want to give the Senator from Oklahoma an opportunity to explain it because the simple reality is I dont think we should be wishing misfortune on any of our Senate colleagues on either side of the aisle I dont know if this was an innocent statement or something he now wants to clarify But as stated it troubles me It troubles me because I am afraid it reflects the situation we find ourselves in too often in the Senate where people are literally invoking Gods name in prayer for political purposesin this case to wish misfortune on one of our colleagues who would not be able to make our 1 am scheduled rollcall I do not wish misfortune on any of our colleagues Under the usual business of the Senate we agree that we will do something more thoughtful and humane and a vote at an earlier time Senator Reid has approached Senator MCConnell and said we have one of our Senators Senator Byrd of West Virginia with significant health problems who was been brought to the floor now early in the morning late at night and in a wheelchair He looks better than ever I might add He is being asked to show up at 1 in the morning because we could not reach what is usual comity and gentlemanly accord on scheduling a vote It is unfortunate because now we face this 1 am vote and with no cooperation on the other side to even change the vote for a very humane reason President let me first acknowledge the Senator from Connecticut who played a critical role in not only the inspiration but the preparation of this important landmark legislation Senator Dodd has been given some tough assignments in his career He has been handed some of the toughest and this was one His Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee met I understand 54 hours if I am not mistaken I think that is what he said earlier on the floor It considered hundreds of amendments with the notion that we could create a better more effective health care system in America I have yet to hear anyone criticize his chairing that committee He was evenhanded and fair He entertained and accepted some 150 or 160 Republican amendments to this bill in an effort to try to build some bipartisan support for it He went the extra mile with extra hearings His committee was weary at the end but he proved that his experience in the Senate had taught him valuable lessons about what it took to be respectful to the other side of an issue He was not rewarded with a final vote in committee Not a single Republican Senator would vote for the bill It was not for any lack of effort on the part of Senator Dodd When this bill passesand this bill will passhe deserves special credit for it and I am going to be one of the first to applaud him He included a provision in this bill near and dear to me on congenital heart research that will save lives and will spare suffering to families across America I will forever be indebted to him for it In just 4 hours in the early morning hours of Monday December 21 2009 one of the most significant votes in the history of the Senate will take place It is hard for us in the midst of this debate after all that has come before us and all that is likely to follow to properly put this in historical context For those of us who were honored by the people of our State to be here at this moment in history it is humbling to know we will be called on to cast a vote that can change a nation It has happened here before but only rarely It happened 75 years ago when other Senators in a much different era battling through the worst depression in our Nations modern history were called on by a President in a wheelchair to rally and stand for the elderly of America He asked to create Social Security an insurance plan primarily for widows President Franklin Roosevelt came to this Senate in this Chamber asking each and every one of the Senators to be mindful of the plight of our parents and grandparents in that time I can recall in my family it was not uncommon for grandparents to end up living in the same home as their children because after they reached the point where they could no longer work for a variety of reasonsphysical retirement whatever it happened to betheir savings were meager and the chance of living independently was limited So their children took them in in that spare bedroom made them part of the family and welcomed but understood that was the only way mom and dad were going to have the dignity they deserved in life Franklin Roosevelt had a different vision He thought if workers throughout their worklife paid a little bit of money each week into a fund they could be ensured there would be a check waiting for them at retirement that would allow them independence and dignity He prevailed and Senators stood up in that era of the 1930s and gave him the votes that were needed to change our Nation when it came to the way we treat the elderly Those on the other side of the aisleRepublicanswere skeptical They were fearful of government fearful of a new program They argued we were headed down a path we would regretechoes of many arguments we are hearing today in opposition to health care reform When their time came later even as recently as a few years ago they tried to dramatically change and rewrite the Social Security Program They called for privatizing it saying we would be much better off if the Social Security trust fund were actually in the stock market Thank goodness the wisdom of America rejected that idea Within months of the suggestion it was proven to be totally false as life savings were lost with the recession that we now are enduring It is an indication of the bravery of a President the courage of a Senate and the fact that they rejected the pleas of those who would say Do nothing Dont touch it Leave that problem alone It was about 45 years ago when another great President had another great idea and that idea was to create Medicare and with the creation of Medicare to say to those same elderly It isnt enough to give you a check to get by each month We want to make sure you have access to doctors and hospitals when you need it Lyndon Baines Johnson the master of the Senate then President managed to engineer the passage of that legislation against critics who once again said It is too much government It is a program that will cost too much money It is not needed We shouldnt do it Their counsel was rejected Medicare was created It wasnt the Medicare we know today It didnt reach the disabled It didnt provide some of the basic services that many seniors now desperately need and it didnt cover prescription drugs but it was a start It was a critical decision made to move forward The same Republican Party that objected to the creation of Medicare has been critical of the program ever since They have argued that it is wasteful that it is doomed that it should be allowed to wither on the vine That was actually a quote from a leading Republican not that long ago They suggested there was a better waylets privatize Medicare They love the notion of privatizing Get government out of the picture They came up with this theory with the health insurance industry of something called Medicare Advantage This was where those flintyeyed entrepreneurs would teach government a lesson They would offer the benefits of Medicare and show how to do it at a lower cost Well we accepted their challenge and gave them their opportunity and what we found was They failed Oh some succeeded but by and large when the final count took place those private insurance companies couldnt help but have the urge to maximize profits at the expense of Medicare So now we spend about 17 billion a year out of Medicare subsidizing private health insurance under the socalled Medicare Advantage Program The experiment has failed The basic idea of Medicare was proven right It gave to our seniors something that we had promised and hoped we could deliverlonger healthier lives It also triggered the creation of a medical health establishment across Americathe building of hospitals and medical schools and more medical professionals than our Nation had ever seen because of Medicare because of a President Lyndon Baines Johnson and his courage and because of a Senate that could rise to the challenge of passing it despite the critics Well in the early hours of Monday December 21 2009 our generation of the United States Senate will face our rendezvous with destiny our opportunity to change this Nation to make such a significant change in the way health care is delivered in America that we can say to future generations We had our moment and we seized it To think that we willwith the passage of this bill in perhaps just a few days in the Senate and a few weeks on Capitol Hillenlarge the percentage of Americans with the security of health insurance from 83 percent to 94 percentthe highest percentage of Americans ever insured in the history of our Nation Of 50 million uninsured Americans today 30 million of those people will finally be able to rest at night knowing they are covered that they have health insurance It will be Judy a worker in Marion IL at a hotel making 8 an hour working 30 hours a week 12000 in annual wages She is a diabetic She has never had health insurance in her life She goes to work every day She is 60 years old She will have health insurance because of this bill She will be covered by Medicaid and she wont have to pay for it because Judys wages are at the low end of workers in America I said to her If you had health insurance Judy what would you do She said Senator I have a few lumps I have been worried about a long time and I cant afford to go to the doctor I would go to the doctor Thank God she can Thank God for a lot of othersthose who have lost their jobs who are unemployed who have exhausted their savings who stand to lose their homeswho will at least have the peace of mind they will have health insurance That is going to come too If you have a child with a health problem as many people do something they call a preexisting condition this bill will tell the health insurance companies immediately You can no longer discriminate against that child You cant turn down the family or that child for coverage As someone who has been through that experience I cant tell you what that means to know that you have that kind of coverage that your child with that health care challenge can go to the doctor they need to see and the hospital they need to be in When my wife and I were first married and had our first baby I was in law school and we had no health insurance When our baby had a problem I had to go to Childrens Hospital here in Washington and sit in a room filled with people who had no health insurance I took a number and we waited for a doctor Every time we went it was a different one I felt like I had let my family down At a time when my family needed health insurance I had not delivered I know that feeling personally and I know what it must mean to 50 million Americans who face it today For 30 million of those Americans this bill will give them the peace of mind that they have health insurance It also says to companies across America we are going to change the terms of this relationship between health insurance companies and the people they insure We are going to finally step in on the side of the consumers of Americathe families of America the ones that are so often turned down because of preexisting conditions turned down because companies canceled their insurance when they started running into high medical bills For the first time these people will have legal rights created by this bill to stand up and be covered and to be confident at the end of the day that they will have the coverage they paid for their whole life It is an amazing thing we are considering In the middle of it with all these speeches and all the press releases and all the charts and all the time it is sometimes difficult to focus on the historical impact of what we are about to do at 1 am on December 21 2009 But if we do this and do it right if 60 Senators step forward as I think they willcommitments have been madewe will make history It will be reported across America that for the first time in memory the United States Senate has voted for comprehensive health care reform The critics will still be there and they will say the same thing they did about Social Security and the same thing they did about Medicare It is too much government It is not going to work We shouldnt do it Thank God that counsel was rejected in the 1930s and the 1960s and it should be rejected on December 21 2009 We need to stand together for people who otherwise have no voicethe uninsured many of whom have lowwage jobs or maybe no jobs at all and their children who really cant afford the best lobbyist in Washington It is time for us to lobby for them I know there are a lot of critics of this plan We have heard them They have talked about Medicare and what this will do to this bill But we know what the professionals have told us This comprehensive health care reform legislation will add 9 or 10 years of solvency to Medicare put Medicare on sound financial footing And that is exactly what we should do The bill has a bonus The bonus is that at a time when we are facing deficits and debt which have to be taken seriously this bill charts a path for us to start retiring that debt The Congressional Budget Office says that over the first 10 years 130 billion in debt will be relieved by this bill then in the second decade of this bills existence and changes we are going to find up to 13 trillion in deficit reduction There has never been a bill considered on the floor of the Senate that has had that kind of impact on our Nations debt It is going to change life not only for uninsured families but even those with insurance For some it will give the luxury that we have as Members of Congress I think we are the luckiest people on Earth when it comes to health insurance We team up with 8 million Federal employees and their families and each year we have an open enrollment If we dont like the way we are treated by our health insurance company in the previous year we can go shopping just like you would shop for a car or a refrigerator and pick the right one for your family We pick the right health insurance for our families Every American should have that luxury and we move toward creating that in this legislation It was several years ago that I teamed up with Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine We tried to create a program for small businesses in America called the SHOP Act This program would give those small businesses the same shopping opportunities for health insurance as Members of Congress and Federal employees I came up with an unlikely ally in the National Federation of Independent Businesses They decided they wanted to join us When their lobbyist called and said he wanted to meet with me I said I cant wait to meet you His organization had done everything in their power to defeat me in every election I had been in and I wanted to see what he looked like He came in and sat down and said We have to do something about health insurance for small business We ended up creating an unlikely but powerful alliance of the National Federation of Independent Businesses the realtors the Service Employees International Union Families USAfrom both sides of the political spectrumstanding behind the SHOP bill The SHOP bill with some changes is now part of health care reform It is an idea that has been endorsed and it is one that I think is going to make a big difference for individuals The bill also contains help for small businesses to pay for the premiums Critics on the other side of the aisle say Oh the taxes go up but the benefits dont start for years They have missed it because initially we are going to be offering tax assistance to small businesses with 50 employees or fewer Those who have an average payroll of 50000 a worker are going to get a helping hand to buy health insurance not only for their workers but for the owner of the company I have seen this in my own life I have friends who run a small business who have lost their health insurance because one employees wife had a very sick baby That is exactly what happened to my friend They went out shopping for insurance on the open market and it was brutal My friends were in their early sixties and they couldnt buy insurance Everything they could buy was loaded with exclusions and deductibles and copays Well we are going to make sure that businesses have a helping hand with a tax credit and that helping hand is going to allow them to buy good insurance that covers their employees Those on the other side talk about the tax increases in this bill Lets be very blunt what they are There is a 9 percent payroll tax increase for individuals making over 200000 a year and families making over 250000 a year What it means is this Roughly 2000 a year for families making over 250000 will have to be paid to make sure that Medicare is solvent and that this program is funded That may affect some Members of Congress with their spouses working But I dont think it is unfair It is a tax we should be willing to pay to solve major problems in this country There will be taxes on highend health insurance policies and it is a very controversial provision with some of my friends in organized labor But I hope we have hit the right number of 23000 and I hope our escalator clause to try to keep up with inflation is a reasonable one If it is not we will revisit it The only law ever written that didnt need amendment might have been the Ten Commandments and I dont think this bill as good as it is will rise to that level We are prepared to return to it if we need to to make sure it works and works well and we have the time to do that This is critical I also know this bill is going to changeyou will be able to see the change across America with the construction of community health clinics One of our great Senators here Bernie Sanders of Vermont has been a clarion voice on behalf of community health clinics He knows as we all do that these clinics placed in cities and towns across America are a lifeline to lowincome people so that they have primary care at a fraction of the cost of a visit to an emergency roomgood care I have seen it I have visited the Erie Clinic in Chicago Alia Clinic in Chicago These are good clean modern clinics with people dedicated to health care and dentistry who are helping these people We envision 10000 more community health clinics as a result of this bill at least and thousands of primary care physicians to be there to help That will mean we will be creating across America a network of care and peace of mind for people who otherwise have few places if any to turn I think the day will come soon when this bill after it is passed will become evident to America in terms of what we set out to do and what we achieved If history serves as it has in the past many of todays critics will not dwell on the fact that they voted no but rather say I had some problems with it I guess it worked out OK They may be afraid to acknowledge that now I think ultimately they will have to This is clearly an idea whose time has come and it has come because we have a President with the courage the political courage to step up and make sure that we not back away As Franklin Roosevelt did in Social Security as Lyndon Johnson did with Medicare Barack Obama with health care reform has challenged this Congress not to ignore a problem that has haunted the Presidencies of seven great men who have previously served in that office We need to do our historic duty in the early morning hours so that Americans across this Nation can wake up to the stories on the news that finally hope is on the way I said the other night when I was talking about thisSenator Dodd put Vicki Kennedys Washington Post column in the Record and I am glad he did sothat this has been called many things It has an official name I am going to call it Kennedy Care I hope some others will too because we do it because of the inspiration of a great friend a great Senator and a great statesman Edward Kennedy who I am sorry cannot be here to enjoy this historic moment But he led us to this moment As he said in one of his last columns he wrote about health care We are almost there In four hours we will be there I yield the floor 
S_SD_THUNE,2009-12-04,2005_2009; 2005_2009,0162; 0163, 2901 and ask for its immediate consideration President I want to speak to the amendment that we just filed at the desk This amendment is very straightforward and very simple It does what a number of my colleagues on the other side have asked to do and that is to strike the CLASS Act from the underlying health care reform bill that is being debated on the floor of the Senate right now I want to read some excerpts from a letter that seven Democratic Senators including the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Senator Conrad put together asking that this CLASS Act not be included as part of this legislation Mr President I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from which I will be quoting There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows US Senate Washington DC October 23 2009 Hon Harry Reid Majority Leader The Capitol Washington DC Dear Leader Reid We write regarding the merger of the Finance and HELP Committee health reform bills We know you face a great many difficult decisions now one of which is whether to include provisions from the HELP Committee bill known as the CLASS Act in the merged bill We urge you not to include these provisions in the Senates merged bill nor to use the savings as an offset for other health items in the merger While the goals of the CLASS Act are laudablefinding a way to provide long term care insurance to individualsthe effect of including this legislation in the merged Senate bill would not be fiscally responsible for several reasons CBO currently estimates the CLASS Act would reduce the deficit by 73 billion over ten years But nearly all the savings result from the fact that the initial payout of benefits wouldnt begin until 2016 even though the program begins collecting premiums in 2011 It is also clear that the legislation increases the deficit in decades following the first ten years CBO has confirmed that the legislation standalone would face a longterm deficit point of order in the Senate Some have argued that the program is actuarially sound But this is the case because premiums are collected and placed in a trust fund which begins earning interest and because the HHS Secretary is instructed to increase premiums to maintain actuarial solvency We have grave concerns that the real effect of the provisions would be to create a new federal entitlement program with large longterm spending increases that far exceed revenues This is especially the case if savings from the first decade of the program are spent on other health reform priorities Slowing the growth of health care costs should be a top priority as we move forward with health reform Inclusion of the CLASS Act would reduce the amount of longterm cost savings that would otherwise occur in the merged bill The CLASS Act bends the health care cost curve in the wrong direction and should not be used to help pay for other health provisions that will become more expensive over time and increase deficits Thank you for your consideration We hope that fiscally responsible measures to improve access to longterm care can be considered in the future Sincerely Kent Conrad Joe Lieberman Mary L Landrieu Evan Bayh Blanche L Lincoln E Benjamin Nelson Mark R Warner US Senators President the letter said We urge you not to include these provisions in the Senates merged bill nor to use the savings as an offset for other health items in the merger While the goals of the CLASS Act are laudablefinding a way to provide long term care insurance to individualsthe effect of including this legislation in the merged Senate bill would not be fiscally responsible for several reasons The letter goes on to say Nearly all the savings result from the fact that the initial payout of benefits wouldnt begin until 2016 even though the program begins collecting premiums in 2011 It is also clear that the legislation increases the deficit in decades following the first 10 years They go on to say in this letter Mr President We have grave concerns that the real effect of the provisions would be to create a new Federal entitlement program with large longterm spending increases that far exceed revenues This is especially the case if savings from the first decade of the program are spent on other health reform priorities That Mr President is a letter that was signed by the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Senator Conrad of North Dakota Senator Lieberman Senator Landrieu Senator Lincoln Senator Warner Senator Nelson and Senator Bayh Seven Democratic Senators have gone on the record saying the CLASS Act shouldnt be included in this legislation because it is not fiscally responsible The fact is the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Senator Conrad has described this as a Ponzi scheme of the first order something that Bernie Madoff would be proud of Now I have heard my colleagues get up and talk about how solvent this is and what a great program this is Well there are programs out there that are available for people to buy longterm care insurance The problem with this one is that it takes all the money that comes in in the early years and spends it on other government programsin this case health care reformbut who knows what other government programs are going to be created that will use the revenues that come in from this plan that supposedly a lot of people are going to sign up for and CBO says it is going to be fewer than 4 percent that will sign up In fact no senior today is going to benefit from it because you have to work for 5 years If you are a senior who is retired you will not see any benefit This doesnt impact seniors contrary to the assertion of some of my colleagues on the other side It will impact future generations of Americans who are going to be stuck with the deficits and the debt that gets piled on them because of the outyears when this liability is incurred as people start getting paid out from having paid in and there is no money there It is the classic definition of a Ponzi scheme The money comes in today it gets spent on other things and then someday when the liability comes in and people start saying I paid into this program and I should get some benefit there will be no money there So we will borrow for it or tax for it or something else They say well it is actuarially solvent over 75 years Well maybe because you are running surpluses in the early years But in the later years you are running huge deficits In the early years the surpluses are being spent They are not being put into paying benefits for this program when those benefits start being demanded by the people who have participated in the program Just look at what others have said about this program Mr President I have quoted for you what the chairman of the Budget Committee Senator Conrad said with regard to this program that it is a Ponzi scheme of the first order and that is being echoed by others But this is what the administrations chief health actuary said about the CLASS Act He said it would result in a net Federal cost in the longer term The chief actuary also determined the program faces a significant risk of failure because the high cost will attract sicker people and lead to low participation The Congressional Budget Office agreed saying The CLASS program included in the bill would generate net receipts for the program in the initial years when total premiums would exceed total benefit payments but it would eventually lead to net outlays when benefits exceed premiums In the decade following 2029 the CLASS program would begin to increase budget deficits This particular quote could come as a bit of a surprise because this comes not from the CBO or the CMS actuary but it comes from the Washington Post The Washington Post called the CLASS Act a gimmick designed to pretend that health care is fully paid for The Post goes on to say The money that flows in during the 10 year budget window will flow back out again These are not savings that can honestly be counted on the balance sheet of reform Even the Washington Post recognizes this for what it is It is a sham This is a budget gimmick Mr President that is designed to obscure the cost of this program by generating surpluses in the early years It is supposed to generate 72 billion in the first 10year window so that counts on the balance sheet of health care reform to make it look better But this program is going to run deficits deficits as far the eye can seeonce the chickens come home to roost Who will pay the bill for that Future generations of Americans Mr President this is not good policy Certainly if you look at programs we already have on the books Medicare is destined to be bankrupt in the year 2017 We have big problems down the roadunfunded liabilities in Social Security This would create a huge new liability down the road that would be unfunded because all the money that comes in during the early years is going to be spent This is more of the same old business as usual in Washington DC that the American people are fed up with We can make people happy today by saying we are creating this new program that makes the majoritys health care reform bill look better because it obscures the real cost of this bill by rolling in these revenues in the early years But there is a longterm impact according to the CBO according to the actuary at Health and Human Services and according to a lot of our colleagues on the other sidethe seven Democrats who signed the letter including the chairman of the Budget Committee who as I said has called this program a Ponzi scheme of the first order something that would make Bernie Madoff proud I dont know how my colleagues on the other side with a straight face can come to the Senate floor and say this is a great program that it is actuarially sound Sure it may be a benefit to a few people but I have to tell you somewhere down the road when the chickens come home to roost there is going to be a huge liability that is going to be facing future taxpayers future generations of Americans as we start to pile up more deficits and more debt as a result of this Ponzi scheme This is a sham Mr President I hope my colleagues will support this amendment It would strike the CLASS Act from the underlying bill not allow those revenues to be assumed in paying for or understating the cost of this bill and not pile mountains of debt onto future generations Mr President I reserve the remainder of my time President the CLASS Act is the same old Washington same old smoke and mirrors same old games I wish to read what the Congressional Budget Office and the chief actuary for the administration have said The program would add to future Federal budget deficits in large and growing fashion If we dont take this out of this legislation if we allow this to become law we are locking in future generations to deficits and debt as far as the eye can see This is as has been described by the other side a Ponzi scheme of the highest order We need to take it out of this bill I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment 
S_AK_MURKOWSKI,2009-12-03,2002_2009; 2002_2009; 2002_2009; 2002_2009; 2002_2009,0074; 0075; 0076; 0073; 0077, Is that better The Senator just missed all the kind remarks I directed to her attention I will make sure those comments that were made for the Record will be delivered to the Senator personally I want to reiterate some points I made yesterday about my amendment and I will also share with my colleagues I know the Senator from Texas mentioned it as well the CBO score we received late last evening It provides us with a score showing a cost savings of 14 billion over the next 10 years I think this is significant as Members certainly from the other side raised the importance of fiscal discipline and our fiduciary responsibility here Importantly the CBO indicated the provisions on the second page which prevent the Secretary from using the recommendations of the USPSTF to deny coverage would cost money which means we are protecting certain benefits and that is very important The amendment we will have before us the Murkowski amendment is one that allows or requires a level of transparency with the recommended health screenings prevention services that are deemed necessary not by some task force that is appointed by folks within the administration not by some commission that has political relationships What we are urging is that the health screenings the preventive services be determined by those who are actually in the field those practitionersthose who are engaged in oncology OBGYNs We need to be looking to the experts We need to be looking to that peerreviewed science We dont need to be looking to those entities that have been brought together by a government entity or by the Secretary We need to be looking to the likes of the American Society of Clinical Oncology the American College of Surgeons the American College of Radiation Oncology the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology We need to look to their recommendations Again as I mentioned yesterday in my comments if you go to their Web sites if you look to their specific recommendations they will give guidance guidance that again is based on their practice in oncology their practice as an OBGYN Look to what they set out as the guidelines for cervical cancer screening for mammograms and let that information be made available publicly through the pamphlets the plans that come together from the insurance companies But allow themallow me as a consumer of health care me as a consumer looking for the best plan for me and my familyto know what those guidelines are not from a government task force but from those who are the real experts I think this is the transparency that health care shoppers are looking for Some have suggested Lisa your amendment doesnt require the insurance companies to provide any prevention or screening services There is no mandate in there If we do not have a mandate then the insurance companies are not going to provide health care prevention and screening services I think we need to ask the question here what is the point of prevention It is to prevent more expensive care in the future by preventing the chronic and more acute illnesses So should not the insurance companies want to utilize more preventive services utilize more screenings more wellness services in order to keep down the costs of care based on the judgment of the doctors based on the judgment of the professionals and not necessarily those who again are part of a government entity I know within my staff I have a member who is on the FEHBP plan but they contact her on a somewhat regular basis about her diabetes care ensuring she is taking her medications getting the necessary preventive services offered by her insurer for her particular condition It has been mentioned by several of my colleagues that this USPSTF is not such a bad group of guys they are not just these nameless faceless bureaucrats I think it is important to recognize and even the American Heart Association has recognized it that the Preventive Services Task Force is limited to only primary care doctors and not specialists such as the oncologists the cancer doctors who see patients every day battling cancer These doctors who are providing Americans with their suggestions on what services are necessary for cancer screenings but yet these doctors are not part of this task force have again shone the spotlight on what happens when you have a government entity or government task force that is basically the one saying this is what is going to be covered this is not what is going to be covered In my amendment we specifically provide that the recommendations from USPSTF cannot be used to deny coverage of an item or service by a group health plan or health insurance offeror I think that is very important I think it is also important to recognize that what we do in my amendment is make sure the health plans consult the recommendations and guidelines of the professional medical organizations to determine what prevention benefits should be covered by these health insurance plans throughout the country We also require plans to provide this information directly to the individuals You get to see it for yourself You get to make that determination So what that means is the doctors and the specialists will be recommending what preventive services to cover not those in Washington DC My amendment ensures that the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall not use any of the recommendations again made by the task force to deny coverage We also include broad protections to prevent bureaucrats at the Department of Health and Human Services from denying care to patients based on comparative effectiveness research And finally we have a provision that ensures the Secretary of Health and Human Services may not define or classify abortion or abortion services as preventive care or as preventive services I think my amendment is straightforward I think it is a good compromise and again it is a clear differential between what we are going to do to allow a woman to have full choice with her doctor as opposed to government telling us who we should be seeing Amendment No 2836 to Amendment No 2786 Mr President I ask consent to call up my amendment No 2836 I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the amendment be dispensed with President I want to start my comments by acknowledging my colleague from Maryland and accept her gracious offer to continue to work on this issue as it relates to womens health and womens health services As has been noted by the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Washington this is an issue that we women of the Senate have come together on repeatedly to work cooperatively While we do have some would say somewhat dueling amendments here I think it is important to recognize the goals we are both seeking to attain here are certainly right in alignment We are just choosing different means to get there But I appreciate again the civility and cooperation from not only Senator Mikulski but the other women of the Senate on this very important issue I wish to reiterate a couple of points about my amendment that I made yesterday President the purpose of this amendment is to ensure we do not have government entities that are making those decisions we as individuals working with our doctors feel is best The intent behind this amendment is to ensure that those medical professional organizations whether it is the American Society of Clinical Oncology or the American College of Surgeons or the American College of Radiation Oncology or the American Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologiststhose who are in the practice those who are making the recommendationsthese are the individuals we want to know are being consulted not some entity that has been created by those of us in the government or by some administration by some Secretary So what we propose with this amendment is an insurance offering if you will You will know fully what is part of your plan It is you and your doctor making these decisions I urge a yes vote on this amendment 
S_AZ_KYL,2009-12-20,1995_2009; 1995_2009,0492; 0493, President I appreciate the comments my colleague from Montana made I think the point my colleague earlier was trying to make was that we just got the bill yesterday and have not gotten a full CBO or final CBO score that the correction simply revealed the fact there is a lot there to digest and we ought to have more time to understand exactly how the interrelated pieces of the bill work how all the CBO scoring relates and so on When CBO can make about a 600 billion error as I understand that is a big error So there is probably more and a lot we dont understand It would be helpful if we had more time to understand this and how it all works and that was the point my colleague was making I believe But I do appreciate my colleague pointing out it is better we work in good faith and for the most part I certainly recall the long conversations the ranking Republican Senator Grassley and the chairman of the committee had I know they worked in good faith and it would be best if we did that It is to that end I wish to speak to some comments a colleague made earlier today I dont know whether it is frustration or maybe just the lens through which partisans view things and their opponents unfortunately that spawned the remarks earlier today from one of our Democratic colleagues but in either event his characterization of his Republican colleagues I think requires response He began by talking about the malignant and vindictive passions that have descended on the Senate Here is what he said and I am quoting too many colleagues are embarked on a desperate no holds barred mission of propaganda obstruction and fear History cautions us of the excesses to which these malignant vindictive passions can ultimately lead Tumbrils have rolled through taunting crowds broken glass has sparkled in darkened streets strange fruit has hung from southern trees I couldnt believe my ears these references to Kristallnacht one of the first and most vicious attacks on the Jews by the Nazis and hanging of Blacks The majority leaders remarks last week comparing the Republicans position on health care to the proslavery movement remain largely ignored as the clumsy offhand remarks of a partisan but the references earlier today appeared not to be offthecuff mistakes but prepared text deliberately delivered by one of the brighter minds of the Senate Our colleague went on to acknowledge and I quote again that in the heat of those vindictive passions some people earnestly believed they were justified Such is the human capacity for intoxication by those malignant and vindictive political passions Well yes Republican Senators do believe our position is justified in fact correct There are honorable people on both sides of the aisle who obviously have to agree to disagree But our colleague attributes no good motive to Republicans whose passions are simply malignant and vindictive He adduces evidence to support his claim First an unnamed editor of the Manchester Inquirer who wrote that the GOP has gone crazy and an unnamed economist who believes our party has been taken over by the irrational right A Philadelphia columnist talked about lunacy on the Republican right Further quoting now it has gone crazy is more and more dominated by the lunatic fringe and has poisoned itself with hate I wonder if my colleagues believe our position is animated by hatred Why else would we oppose this legislation Well he answers that question too It is because he says first of all to break the momentum of our new young President They are desperate to break this President They have ardent supporters who are nearly hysterical at the very election of President Barack Obamathe birthers the fanatics the people running around in rightwing militias and Aryan support groups It is unbearable to them that President Barack Obama should exist That is one powerful reason It is not the only one Well talk about vindictive passions Does my colleague believe that is why I oppose the legislationor my colleague John MCCain I hate to disappoint some folks but I dont care about the political fortunes of the President at least not right now I may about 3 years from now I dont like this bill That is why I oppose it My colleague says there is another reason He says it is the insurance industry which he proceeded to demonize I am not one to defend the insurance industry but it is strange to see it so demonized by my colleague whose party brags of getting another 30 million people insured by what The insurance industry Why subject these folks to such awful torture But the real irony is the legislation which we oppose the insurance industry supported It made a deal with the Obama administration and key Senate Democrats You mandate that every American has to buy one of our policies and we will support your bill There was a deal all right but it was between the insurance industry and key Democrats The insurance industry obviously didnt dictate the Republican position which largely opposes the individual mandate Well finally our colleague also accused Republicans of engaging in something else He said we were engaged in a campaign of falsehood about death panels and cuts to Medicare benefits and benefits for illegal aliens and bureaucrats to be parachuted in between you and your doctor He went on to state Our colleagues terrify the public with this parade of imagined horrors They whip up concerns and anxiety then they tell us the public is concerned about the bill So the reason the public is opposed to the bill is because of the power of Republican Senators to terrify our constituents about imagined horrors Let us look at the examples given I dont know of any Republican Senator who has characterized the health care rationing as coming from death panels I heard that phrase in another context We have tried to discuss the provisions of the bill we believe do result in rationing The chairman of the committee and I have had a lot of debate on this subject I wish Senator Roberts and I could offer a couple of the amendments we wanted to offer to make sure there is no rationing in the bill I think it is a real problem and should be debated on its merits The benefits for illegal aliens I suspect he was referring there to the House debate but it is still the case that there are completely inadequate provisions in the bill to verify eligibility for benefits You can even apply by telephone so just about anybody could apply for some of the benefits Third the matter of Medicare benefits I dont think we are terrorizing our constituents about Medicare benefits unless they understand the facts and the facts are that Medicare benefits are going to be cut The Congressional Budget Office says the Medicare Advantage benefits are going to be reduced from a monthly actuarial value of 135 down to 49 a month That is CBO saying there is going to be reduction in the benefits for those who have the private Medicare Advantage policies That includes dental vision hearing vision care fitness and a variety of other programs We have had a semantic debate in this Chamber between those who say Well the fundamental benefits of the Medicare law are not specifically eliminated or reduced in the legislative language of the bill That is true But what is also true is the additional benefits in Medicare Advantage are being reduced That is unassailable It is also trueand CMS for example refers to thisthat enrollment is going to be reduced because of these reductions in benefits They talk about the lower benchmarks and they say when it is fully phased in enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans would decrease by about 33 percent So this is not some kind of fantasy This is taken from the Congressional Budget Office and from the CMS Actuary Finally in addition to the Medicare Advantage the Actuary says simulations by the Office of the Actuary suggest that roughly 20 percent of party providers that is hospitals nursing homes home health care would be unprofitable within the 10year projection period as a result of productivity adjustments That means they would go out of business Obviously senior care is going to be affected by this legislation and we believe negatively so That is an honest debate to have and it is one which we would like to have But finally my colleague turned the world upside down by arguing the only reason we are here the week before Christmas is because of Republican bad behavior that we ruined the holidays for the professional staff because we followed the procedures of the Senate that require the reading of the bill It is true that requirement is usually waived but then we usually have plenty of time to know what is in a bill Usually a bill works its way through committee and both parties know what is in it We both help to write the bill It is transparent It is usually printed long before it comes to the Senate floor so we know what is in it The reason it was read was so our staff would in fact have time to read it to advise usbecause we didnt all have time to read it ourselvesand to advise the public our constituents of what is in it Again we received it yesterday and we are voting on it tonight That is very little time to know everything that is in there The more we learn about what is in there the angrier a lot of people get The special deals for one State for example are simply wrong That is why you take time to see what is in it The majority of the public according to opinion polls want us to take more time to understand what is in this bill A final point on this I have to say the majority leader dictates the schedule of the Senate All Senators are pretty much equal but the majority leader has two things he can do and only he can do He has the right of first recognition and he has the right to set the schedule By the schedule I mean when he files a cloture motion which is what brings this bill to the floor or this amendment to the floor When he files the cloture motion that is what determines when the vote will be He determines when to bring the Senate back in session Under the rules an hour after he brings us back in session the cloture motion ripens and we have a vote He can set that time at any time He can say tomorrow morning at 9 am the Senate will come back in session and we will vote at 10 am The leader could do that That is his right and he is the only one who has the right to do that But instead he says we will come in at 1 minute past midnight tonight Therefore the vote will be 1 minute past 1 am tomorrow morning It is his right to do that We didnt do that he did that He is the only one who has the right to set that schedule If he wanted to set a schedule that was a little more convenient for all the Membersincluding our dear friend the Senator from West Virginia who is ill and indeed does have to get out of a bed to come in a wheelchair to this Chamberthe majority leader has it within his power to say we will do it at a more convenient time Why would he do it in this way Because he has deliberately decided and all majority leaders have not done quite this but have done similar thingsto set a recess and then work us up against the recess so we will have an incentive to finish It is usually a pretty good incentive Certainly going home for Christmas is a big incentive So the majority leader figures if he can schedule this bill and the various votes in such a way that we end up voting on it on Christmas Eve that maybe then we will hurry up and try to do it because as one Democratic staffer is quoted as saying We need to hurry up and pass this bill because the longer it hangs around the harder it will be meaning to pass it That is true The more the public finds out about it the less they like it So the majority leader is trying to get it done as quickly as he can and as quickly as he can means scheduling us for a vote 1 hour after we come in Since there has to be an intervening dayand today is the intervening daytonight at 1 minute after midnight we will reconvene for the next day and then have the vote at 1 am It is purely the majority leaders decision to do it that way Republicans have nothing to do with it If I had my way we would vote at 10 oclock in the morning But that is not the way it is going to be So please dont say it is Republican bad behavior that results in having to vote on this bill late at night The process is determined by the majority leader I guess I am going to conclude by saying I dont believe this bill can be sold on its merits and I think that is another reason why we have to hurry up and do itbefore the public figures out what is in it The public opposes this bill not for the reasons imagined by my colleague but because it will cut Medicare benefits it will increase insurance premiumsnot cause them to go downit will raise taxes put the government in charge of too much it will cost trillions of dollars and it will result in the delay and denial of care That is why the majority of Americans want us to start over and address the problems on a stepbystep basis I was amused by my counterpart the Democratic whip saying Republicans have only offered four amendments I think it was seven but say it is four Guess who determines how many amendments we get to offer The majority leader He sets that schedule as well He says now it is our turn to offer an amendment Then it is your turn The way he managed the schedule we only got to file either four or seven amendments We have 200 amendments pending We would love to get as many of these pending and voted on as possible Believe me it is not Republicans who dont want to vote on our amendments The majority leader again has set the schedule This is why we oppose the bill It is why we dont like the process We respect what our constituents are telling us We believe this bill will be bad for them and it will be bad for our country Our Democratic colleagues have a different position Neither their position nor ours is malignant nor should they be expressed vindictively President a lot of attention has been paid to the position of the senior Senator from Nebraska on this legislation Page 98 of the amendment provides that the State of Nebraska is carved out from being responsible for paying for additional Medicaid patients added under the bill It is the only State explicitly carved out from this requirement I address this as well to the chairman of the committee I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and it be in order to offer an amendment to extend to all States the same benefit that provides 100 percent Federal funding to the State of Nebraska for their expanded Medicaid Program This would give the same treatment to other States that currently only Nebraska would enjoy under this bill If the bill is a good thing for all States then it seems to me it should be applied equally to all States 
S_MA_KERRY,2009-12-05,1985_2009; 1985_2009; 1985_2009; 1985_2009; 1985_2009; 1985_2009; 1985_2009; 1985_2009,0150; 0147; 0148; 0149; 0151; 0152; 0153; 0154, Madam President I will yield myself such time as I will use There have been times during this debate that I have listened with astonishment to the minority They agree with the diagnosisthat our health care system is in need of treatment But they offer no remedy no prescription no cure We dont need a second opinion on what the problems are with our health care system Our country leads the world in the advancement of medical science We have the best doctors the best technology and the best hospitals in the world It is no surprise to see kings and queens come to the United States for medical treatment But for all that the system is dysfunctional wasteful and abusive It rewards quantity over quality And it delivers profits more than care It is a system in which too many American families are just one illness or one injury away from financial ruin I would like to thank Majority Leader Reid Chairman Baucus Chairman Dodd and Chairman Harkin for getting us to this important point in our long march toward a health care system that is affordable and available to all Americans Their efforts have presented us an opportunity to cast a vote that will make life better for every single American It isnt often that we get a chance to do that But we have that chance now I know the majority leader the Senate Finance Committee and the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committees have each tirelessly worked on the provisions in this bill and have taken great care to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries will maintain access to their guaranteed benefits and will receive additional preventive benefits and expanded prescription drug coverage The amendment offered Senator Johanns is very similar to the MCCain amendment we debated over the last few days Once again the opponents of this bill are endorsing the status quo that leaves Medicare on the brink of going bankrupt and seniors facing higher costs My amendment simply ensures that no beneficiary would receive a reduction in their guaranteed Medicare home health benefit Let me remind my colleagues again what will happen if we stick with the status quo The status quo means Medicare will be broke in approximately 8 years The status quo means seniors will continue paying higher and higher premiums and costsharing due to wasteful overpayments to providers The status quo means that each year billions of Medicare dollars will continue to be wasted on lining the pockets of private insurance companies And the status quo means that seniors will continue struggling to pay for prescription drugs The stakes for seniors and for the Medicare Program have never been higher Senators have a choice Endorse the status quo or strengthen Medicare Regarding Medicare changes for home health providers let me describe what is in the Senate bill As most of my colleagues would agree home health care is an important benefit in the Medicare Program Today more than 3 million Medicare beneficiaries receive home health services across the countryincluding those with acute illnesses and injuries and those afflicted with numerous chronic conditions Across the country more than 9800 home health agencies provide care to seniors in their homes This care helps seniors get better and avoid expensive rehospitalizations Home health providers make a real difference in improving seniors health We should support their efforts While I have great respect for the services of home health providers we also have a responsibility to protect the Medicare Program As part of this we must make sure Medicare is paying appropriatelyand not overpayingfor Medicare services We must also take action to root out fraud and abuse in the Medicare Program I believe the policies in the Senate bill achieve both goals First the Senate bill would rebase home health payments to ensure payments reflect actual costs of providing care These changes are based on MedPAC recommendations which is the nonpartisan group that advises Congress on Medicare When the current home health payments were set seniors received an average of 31 visits per episode Today they only receive 22 visits The Senate bill directs CMS to rebase payments to reflect this change That is common sense The Senate bill also roots out fraud in the system by revising how Medicare pays for outlier cases Medicare provides an extra payment today for providers who treat sicker or outlier patients Unfortunately the GAO found that some providers were gaming the system and getting more outlier payments than they deserve For example GAO found that in one Florida County providers were receiving 60 percent of all total outlier paymentseven though the county had less than 1 percent of the total Medicare population Clearly something was going on there that needs to be changed The Senate bill addresses this problem by placing a cap on the amount any individual provider can receive in outlier payments In addition it establishes a productivity adjustment for home health providers beginning in 2015 These changes ask home health providerslike all other providersto offer more efficient and higher quality care over time I believe the Senate policies are fair and reasonable In making these changes we worked closely with the home health industry to ensure these changes were reasonable and fair On the rebasing policy MedPAC recommended we fully implement these changes in 2011 To ensure providers could adapt to the new payment rates the Senate bill phases in the changes over 4 years The home health providers support this phasein The outlier policy and fraud changes were actually suggested by the home health industry The home health industry fully supports these changes For the productivity changes the Senate bill holds off on applying these reductions while the rebasing policy is taking effect This will give providers extra time to adapt to the payment changes and is much less aggressive than the proposals put forth by MedPAC the House bill and the administration which require all of these payment changes to be implemented at the same time Finally the Senate bill includes special protections for rural home health providers From 20102015 rural providers will receive a 3 percent extra payment each year This payment will ensure that rural providers are protected as we reform the broader home health system In total the Medicare delivery reforms in the Senate bill strike a fair balance between ensuring seniors have access to care while also rooting out inappropriate payments from the system The opponents of these Medicare changes do not have a plan to protect seniors and strengthen the Medicare Program They advocate doing nothing The opponents of health reform are now claiming that Medicare beneficiaries will be harmed by this bill And here is what AARPfor examplehas said about these claims AARP Opponents of health reform wont rest They are using myths and misinformation to distort the truth and wrongly suggesting that Medicare will be harmed After a lifetime of hard work dont seniors deserve better I would like to remind my colleagues of the positive changes in the bill It improves the solvency of the Medicare Program by 5 years It puts 30 billion back into the pockets of seniors in the form of lower Medicare premiums It makes prescription drugs more affordable It guarantees that seniors can continue to see the doctor of their choosing It provides free wellness and prevention benefits to Medicare beneficiaries And it also includes fair and appropriate changes for home health that protect access to care The truth is the Johanns amendment is harming seniors harming the Medicare Program and harming taxpayers For this reason I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment by Senator Johanns and to support my home health amendment which ensures that no beneficiary would receive a reduction in their guaranteed Medicare home health benefit I just listened to my friend Senator Grassley He and I have a good relationship we work together here we both serve on the Finance Committee I have enjoyed a lot of the things we do together Clearly whatever I am saying is going to be substantive but there is nothing personal in it I have to say there is a lack of reality here in a lot of the comments we are hearing from our friends on the other side of the aisle and a persistance in perpetuating a myth A lot have seen the politics of this country where if you say something over and over no matter how true it is it can have an impact I know that personally But let me tell you I heard the Senator from Iowa sayI am going to quote him I wrote it down Certainly if 450 billion is being taken out of Medicare it is hurting Medicare That is what he said Let me review what is happening here I want to go back to the comments of the Republican nominee for President last year This is a quote John MCCain from an article in the Wall Street Journal John MCCain would pay for his health care plan with major reductions to Medicare and Medicaid a top aide said in a move that independent analysts estimate could result in cuts of 13 trillion After I said that on the floor the Senator from North Carolina Senator Burr stood up and said Have you seen factcheckorg I said I havent read the specific article but we didnt see that corrected in the course of the campaign Now I have seen the article I wanted to know what the Senator from North Carolina was referring to so I went and got factcheckorg Factcheckorg went through the Obama campaign ads and their ads and fact checked what was being said The MCCain adviser is a fellow named HoltzEakin In a conference call with reporters after the ad was released what he said was No service is being reduced Every beneficiary will in the future receive exactly the benefits that they have been promised from the beginning That is the same thing as we are doing No benefit is being cut But he didnt say he was not going to reduce the overall amount of money What he said subsequently and I am quoting from factcheckorghere it is as late as October 17 about 2 weeks before the electionMr Holtz Eakin said in a telephone conference call with reporters representing the campaign for the Republican party Any shortfall in MCCains health care plan will be covered without cutting benefits by such measures as Medicare fraud and abuse reduction employing a new generation of treatment models for expensive chronic diseases speeding adoption of lowcost generic drugs and expanding the use of information technology in medicine That is exactly some of which is happening right heresome of which is happening right here Lets get this conversation into a place of reality Here is what happened in arriving at the reductions in overall Medicare expenditures which does not reduce any benefit to any senior citizen which is why AARP that represents 40 million senior citizens is supporting the Democratic legislation They have written that to us as late as yesterday Madam President 120 billion comes from reducing overpayments in Medicare Someone on the other side of the aisle has to explain to me how you hurt Medicare by stopping the charging of a 90 overprice of premium to seniors which is what happens Do you know how the overpayments are paid for Every senior couple in a traditional Medicare plan pays an additional 90 per year in order to finance the overpayments What they are suggesting is we shouldnt cut overpayments What they are suggesting is Medicare is OK paying seniors in a certain group an overpayment that doesnt even go to the seniors Guess whom it goes to It goes to the insurance company Are you telling me we ought to go to the taxpayers and say Hey folks we know we are paying a 14percent overpayment for the service compared to what we pay for everybody else and we are going to keep on paying it That is exactly what our friends on the other side of the aisle are saying What we are saying is No we think we ought to reduce that payment and that is the 120 billion That doesnt cut one benefit for a senior but it makes the program more effective Let me go further Here are the people who have come together in a series of meetings to say Yes we can live with a reduction in our overall Medicare payment because we can be more efficient The hospitals came to the White House and said We are willing to reduce the payments we are receiving by 150 billion Guess what We are not even doing that We are only asking them to reduce their payments by 106 billion That is what is in this bill The hospitals have agreed I represent hospitals in Massachusetts We have one of the best hospital systems in America in the network of hospitals we have People come from all over the world to come to our hospitals I see the Senator from Minnesota They come from all over the world to go to some of the hospitals Minnesota has The fact is those hospitals agree we can do this more efficiently and we can reduce the overall payments under Medicare We have worked very hard to protect the way we do that so it doesnt do injury The insurers have come to the table Home health care came to the table I read the letter earlier from home health care services It is from the President of the National Association for Home Care Hospice He writes We support the provisions of your health care reform legislation as they relate to home health care That is what we are debating on the floor They do support it The fact is the Senator from Georgia who stood and said In our State we have a letter that sayswell first of all that is based on an earlier assumption Secondly we have no idea what the assumptions are in the analysis they made Thirdly it is based primarily on the House bill which has 13 billion more in reductions than we have So before we get stuck there we ought to listen to the national association that is working with us on a daily basis where we agree on what the reductions ought to be The skilled nursing facilities the rehab facilities the longterm acute care hospitals have all come to the table and said We can do this Is that their preference Do they love it Nobody wants their budget to be tightened where they have to make changes to try to be more effective But the bottom line is every single one of them has agreed with what we are doing on this side of the aisle Notwithstanding that our friends on the other side of the aisle keep coming back and keep trying to stand for grandma or stand for some senior citizen who is being falsely scared into believing their benefit is going to be cut or that Medicare is somehow going to be less available to them My amendment which we will ultimately vote on will guarantee that no benefit is going to be cut for any senior under this plan That is what we are going to do In addition to that let me remind my colleagues and people listening what this bill does This bill actually improves the solvency of Medicare We have heard any number of people say Medicare is going to go bankrupt by 2017 Indeed it is We stretch that out We improve that so we can then take the improvements in the health care system It improves the solvency of the Medicare program by 5 years It puts 30 billion back into the pockets of seniors in the form of lower Medicare premiums It makes prescription drugs more affordable It guarantees that seniors can continue to see the doctor of their choice It provides free wellness and prevention benefits to Medicare beneficiaries They are busy talking about the cuts when this actually improves what Medicare beneficiaries are going to get They dont have wellness and prevention benefits today It provides for them It guarantees they will see the doctor of their choice It actually puts 30 billion back into their pockets and it also includes fair and appropriate changes for home health that actually protects access to health care The truth is the Johanns amendment is the amendment that actually would wind up hurting seniors This amendment provides additional benefits We all understand the importance of this The Senate bill releases home health care payments so those payments actually reflect the real cost of providing care We do that not in a partisan way We do that based on the nonpartisan MedPAC commission recommendations to us of how you can improve Medicare Our colleagues have a long way to go on the other side to begin to talk about real health care change This bill roots out fraud from the system revises how Medicare pays for the outlier cases that is the cases that treat the sicker or what we call outlier patients Unfortunately GAO found some providers were gaming the system and getting more outlier payments than they deserve Do they want us to continue to overpay people providing service that people either dont need or charging more for the service that they do need but could have gotten at a lower price Those are the changes we make The American people will be proud of it Let me give an example The GAO found that in a Florida county providers were receiving 60 percent of all the other outlier payments even though the county had less than 1 percent of the total Medicare population That is absurd What we do is fix those kinds of absurdities that make Americans so angry about the administration of their tax dollars in Washington I believe the Senate bill addresses a number of these problems in a thoughtful way We need to have a debate about what is in this bill and what the real impacts are and what the negative impacts are of not doing these things Our colleagues stand for the status quo This is going to be historic when we pass it because it is going to benefit people in so many different ways getting rid of preexisting condition restraints not having people kicked off insurance they thought they had but when they get sick they find it is gone We end that We get 31 billion more people covered in a way that spreads the risk of being sick in a sensible way and reduces the costs for other Americans That is common sense I am proud of what we are doing President just one moment President I just was notifiedI wish to respond to a few of the things here The Senator from Arkansas has the pending amendment My amendment is apparently not quite ready to be called up What I want to do if I can make a couple comments so the conversation doesnt stay where it is prior to the Senator from Arkansas and then I will yield and then I would like to be able to come back after that with my amendment I wish to say to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle I have listened carefully obviously for a number of days now I notice most of them have indeed disappearedas the Senator from Montana suggested It is pretty hard to have a legitimate debate in the Senate when people speak and then leave the floor and we cant actually test the things that have been said One of the things that was said a moment ago by the Senator from Utah was you cannot find any doctors who support this plan Can you find doctors who oppose it Absolutely I will give him that But dont come to the floor of the Senate and suggest there are not huge numbers of doctors across the country who are desperately waiting for the Senate to pass health care reform and in fact this plan In fact the AMA this is what the AMA says They represent tens of thousands of doctors across the country and they said We are working to put the scare tactics to bed once and for all and inform patients about the benefits of health reform We have heard an incredible amount of scare tactics Senator after Senator standing there jumping up pounding out one sort of misstatement or one distortion or another The bottom line is they have stood there for the last hour or so claiming they are standing there to protect seniors It is ironic when one Senator the Senator from Arizona who said yesterday and sort of repeated it todaythis is what he said yesterday I will eagerly look forward to hearing from the authors of this legislation as to how they can possibly add 12 trillion in cuts without impacting existing Medicare programs negatively and eventually lead to rationing of health care That is the Senator from Arizona today Only a year ago when he was running for President of the United States this is what the Senator proposed John MCCain would pay for his health plan with major reductions to Medicare and Medicaid a top aid said in a move that independent analysts estimate could result in cuts of 113 trillion in 10 years to the government programs Consistency obviously has never constrained anybody in politics We know that But to stand there over the last half hour or 45 minutes and say Seniors are going to get hurt and seniors dont support this and we are here to protect seniorsjust a few days ago the organization that represents 40 million seniors in America it is the largest single representative group of seniors in our countrywe all know it it is called AARP It is the American Association of Retired Persons It represents people from 50 years old on up There are a total of about 90 million of those in the United States of America so they represent about half the seniors in America Their interest day to day is making sure those seniors interests are not hurt by what we do here in Washington Here is what they said on November 20 Opponents of health reform wont rest They are using myths and misinformation to distort the truth and wrongly suggest that Medicare will be harmed After a lifetime of hard work dont seniors deserve better This is what AARP said a few days before that on November 18 The new Senate bill makes improvements to the Medicare program by creating a new annual wellness benefit providing free preventive benefits andmost notably for AARP members reducing drug costs for seniors who fall into the dreaded Medicare doughnut hole a costly gap in prescription coverage The Federation of American Hospitals said the following Hospitals always will stand by senior citizens They have no intention of pulling out the support that exists today The American Medical Association We are working to put the scare tactics to bed once and for all and inform patients about the benefits of health reform The Catholic Health Association of the United States The possibility that hospitals might pull out of Medicare is very very unfounded Catholic hospitals would never give up on Medicare patients So everything we have just heard continues the scare tactics trying to gin anger in America that is unfounded based on the basics of this bill Let me call attentionthis is the report this year in March that came out from Medicareit is about Medicare payment policy It is a report to us the Congress by MedPAC As we all know MedPAC is the entity that oversees the administration of Medicare and its concern is maintaining the viability of Medicare making sure Medicare patients are not hurt by a particular program What is in this billthat Senator Baucus and those of us on the Finance committee put in the billis precisely what MedPAC told us we should do and could do without harming seniors Let me share specifically what they said we should do The recommendation is that Congress should eliminate the market basket increase for 2010 and advance the planned reductions for coding adjustments in 2011 to 2010 so that payments in 2010 are reduced by 55 percent to 1990 levels They suggested that They did it because they know it will make the program sounder and it will allow them to make payments in other areas of Medicare that wind up taking care of Medicare beneficiaries more effectively They said The Congress should direct the Secretary of health and human services to rebase rates for home health care services to reflect the average cost of providing care That is precisely what we do here But the other side jumps up and they will take any change anything that reflects a shift from one place to anotherthey will exploit shamelessly in an effort to scare seniors and pretend it is somehow going to affect them What is interestingand America ought to take note of thisthey keep coming to the floor and they keep opposing what is here They keep wanting to strip something out They keep wanting to send the bill back so that ends this process altogether But they do not come to the floor of the Senate and show us how we could fix it more effectively and in fact serve seniors better rather than just embracing the status quo Everyone in America knows the status quo is unacceptable We cannot afford it Medicare will go bankrupt within the next 10 years and then where are we going to be This is the time for responsible action and every step we have offered offers that kind of responsible action without reducing care I will make one last comment and I will yield to the Senator from Arkansas and then come back and talk about further ways in which this in fact serves seniors and others more effectively But as they have talked for the last moments they have been talking about home care cuts I have an amendment that shortly we will talk about that will prohibit any reduction in home care that will guarantee we are clear that we are prohibiting any reduction in home care But I have long been an advocate for better home care more home care capacity In the Finance Committee I offered amendments to sustain that home care quality Nobody worked harder than our late colleague Senator Ted Kennedy with whom I worked for years on this to try to extend home health care protect home health care patients and augment home health care Here is what the people who represent home health care in America have to say This is from the National Association for Home Care Hospice a letter they sent to Senator Baucus It was a letter they sent yesterday The National Association for Home Care Hospice supports making health care available to all Americans We believe that everyone must be willing to sacrifice to make this happen The National Association for Home Care Hospice has agreed to do its part by reducing costs and payments in a manner that makes the Medicare home care program more efficient and less susceptible to abuse We are grateful for the opportunity to make these improvements and at the same time protect the thousands of ethical providers who are participating in this important program We are pleased to have the opportunity to work with your staff to make this happen For all these reasons the National Association for Home Care Hospice supports the provisions of your health care reform legislation as they relate to home health care We look forward to working with you and your staff Thank you for the important work you are doing Who better to speak to the concerns of home health care The folks who have continually been distorting this debate and who continue to try to scare people or an association whose sole existence whose payroll every day is put to the use of protecting the folks they represent in home care I think the answer is selfevident to anybody who wants to listen to common sense What I am aware of is that the individual who was running for President of the United States never stood up and said it was false I dont have any quote of Senator MCCain ever refuting it All I can say is that throughout the campaign that was the operative language It was debated It was never refuted I yield the floor Reserving the right to object Madam President I am not going to object to putting something important in but I would like my colleague to stay for a moment because this is very important I have objected to a statement being put in unless I have a chance to explain it I thank my friend from Arizona because this is the way the Senate ought to work I totally agree with what the Senator said I want the Senator to know I agree with him He is correct that the statement in FactCheckorg calls the Obama campaign to account for a misstatement about his proposal I agree It did that It did not recommend a reduction in benefits But that is not what I suggested that it did What I am talking about is the Senator saidand his staff insistedhe could get the savings for his reductions that would benefit Medicare from waste fraud and abuse from new treatment models from expanding the use of information technology and that there is a complete similarity between what we are doing in order to achieve these savings and what he was doing I am trying to point out the similarity not the difference I am not here to debate the campaign ad I think it didnt accurately reflect the Senators position But do I believe if you read the whole article which is why I will not object to it being put in there you will see it clearly says he is supportive of savings in Medicare so you can do it without cutting benefits which is exactly what we are doing I yield the floor and thank my colleague for his courtesy 
S_IL_BURRIS,2009-12-08,2009_2009,0069, Madam President it is also my pleasure to stand with my colleagues and be a part of this health reform package to give recognition to those distinguished senior Senators who have put so much heart into drafting this important legislation to our Leader Reid and to Senator Baucus Senator Dodd and all the individuals It is a pleasure for me to be a part of this freshman colloquy on this major package Over the past several months my freshman colleagues and I have taken the floor many times to speak about the need for comprehensive health care reform I am pleased to join them today as we discuss our cost containment package This set of provisions will help promote accountability increase efficiency and reduce disparities in our health care system Our amendment will reinforce and improve the principles of highvalue low cost care that is central to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Our amendment will strengthen Medicares ability to act as a payment innovator paying for value and not for volume In speeding this process our amendment gives Medicare more of the resources it needs to gather data expand programs that work and reach the neediest patients We also work to strengthen waste fraud and abuse provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in order to make sure that the Department of Health and Human Services has the tools to not only punish offenders but to prevent fraud from happening in the first place But this is not just about our public programs We also promote privatepublic data sharing to get a better picture of our whole medical system Our amendment further takes aim at administrative costs another barrier often cited to getting the most effective care by encouraging publicprivate collaboration to create uniform standards and reduce the mountain of paperwork that takes doctors time away from their patients Finally we put pressure on private insurers to change the way they pay By encouraging insurers to reward programs that reduce disparities providers will increasingly focus attention on populations that need it most By proactively targeting these needy folks through cultural competency training language services and community outreach our amendment will increase wellness and reduce the use of costly emergency room care My colleagues and I are supported by top business groups consumer groups and providers because they all know we have to transform the way care is delivered in this country Businesses know that without the reduced cost of care and promoting transparency the cost of premiums continues to rise putting a stranglehold on wage increases and making them less competitive Consumer groups want to ensure the patients get more value for their dollar that they do not just get more care but they get the type of coordinated effective care that will keep them healthy and out of the emergency rooms Those providers who focus on targeted care to get the best patient outcome want to be rewarded for doing so The evidence could not be clearer the conclusions could not be more decisive that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act coupled with our amendment will lower costs for ordinary Americans I call upon my colleagues to take an honest look at what we are doing and I defy them to say that health care reform will not reduce costs and improve the functioning of our health care system The debate over health care reform cannot be scoring political points It must be about the health and wellbeing of the American people All of our great work will bear fruit and we will reform our Nations health system because there is no other option Our citizens demand it and they deserve no less I thank our distinguished colleagues I am happy to be a part of this freshman colloquy in presenting such an important issue at this time in history in this great country of ours I yield the floor 
S_IA_GRASSLEY,2009-12-20,1981_2009; 1981_2009,0269; 0270, President we have all been waiting for many weeks while the Democratic leadership worked behind closed doors out of public view to write this new health care reform bill and this process of course is very much contrary to what the President promised during the campaignthat negotiations on the health care reform bill would even be on CSPAN so everybody in the country could see it So now a very secretly put together bill is out for our consideration with just a few days to consider it Last week they were considering expanding Medicare to people between 55 and 64 years of agealso increasing Medicare to cover people up to 150 percent of povertyand thirdly having a governmentrun plan run by the Office of Personnel Management Now we have something entirely different We have the Reid amendment and it is chock full of special deals It does nothing to fix the fatal flaws in the 2074page bill we started with and now we have a bill that is probably 400 pages longer than 2074 pages What kind of changes does this new amendment make to the original Reid amendment Well one tax disappearsit was a tax on cosmetic surgeryand in its place we have a new tax a tax on tanning bed services The dial on the Medicare payroll tax is turned up So the firsttime marriage penalty in a Medicare taxone that hits about half the twoearner couplesis enhanced Well over 1 million couples get to look forward to that tax hitcan you believe itjust for being married So the old marriage penalty is back The dial on the insurance fee is also turned up in the back end of the bill But with respect to a few favored insurance companies the fee is turned off The very limited small business tax credit is expanded over 12 trillion in new taxes according to the official congressional scorekeepers What kind of tax changes stay the same Basically the managers amendment in the underlying Reid amendment still imposes new taxesnew taxes on everything from tanning beds to insurance companies to wages to heart valves to drugs and even more Contrary to what has been said on the Senate floor this very day the tax burden still rests on many middleclass folks As has been said there is a sizable subsidy that 12 million taxfiling families and individuals receive We do not dispute that But what the other side does not want to acknowledge is this There are 42 million taxfiling middleclass families and individuals who will pay higher taxes under this 2000plus page bill For every middleclass taxfiling family who receives an insurance subsidy three middleclass families will pay higher taxes I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of a corrected version of an article from Congressional Daily dated December 18 of this year There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows From CongressDaily AM Dec 18 2009 Labor Cites JCT Analysis To Argue Against Cadillac Tax By Peter Cohn Labor officials Thursday unveiled new ammunition in their fight against a proposal to tax highcost health insurance plans in the Senate health bill citing a congressional analysis that found more than 22 million households earning less than 200000 would see a tax increase by 2019 That figure could rise a bit as the Joint Committee on Taxation did not distribute information on tax returns for married couples earning up to 250000 which is the threshold set by President Obama when he pledged not to tax the middle class The tax issue could be the most intractable difference between Senate and Housepassed legislationwhich instead relies on a millionaires surtaxas Democratic leaders struggle to cobble together a bill that can pass in both chambers next year Communications Workers of America President Larry Cohen whose group released the JCT figures said they demonstrate irrefutably that the excise tax which will result in reduced coverage and increased costs for our middle class familiesis the opposite of reform Most House Democrats and union officials are adamant that the final version does not break Obamas pledge and tax those households earning less than 250000 Obama at one point appeared to endorse the House bills surtax which is the singlebiggest revenue source in either bill at 4605 billion There are major problems with that tax in the Senate however not least because it is not indexed for inflation It also could affect about onethird of all income earned by small business owners that file individual tax returns according to JCT This is going to be a major problem no question about it said a senior Democratic aide The White House is going to have to weigh in and provide some direction There have been some mixed signals The president in a July press conference said the House surtax meets my principle of not burdening families who are already having a tough time In a speech to Congress after Labor Day however Obama endorsed the Senate excise tax as a modest change that could help hold down the cost of health care for all of us in the long run The 40 percent excise tax in the Senate bill would affect employersponsored coverage worth more than 8500 for single workers and 23000 for family plans beginning in 2013 Those figures would rise with inflation plus 1 percent each year with higher beginning thresholds for older workers and those in highrisk professions Certain highcost states would be granted additional room before the tax kicks in In a White House blog post Wednesday National Economic Council Deputy Director Jason Furman said the Senate bill would not hike taxes on the middle class and actually would provide a net tax cut He noted JCT estimates that only 3 percent of health premiums would be affected in 2013 a figure that rises to 8 percent by 2019 as well as the higher wages that would accompany a decrease in costly health benefits One school of thought holds that whatever bill is able to muster 60 Senate votes will form the basis for the final legislation and House Speaker Pelosi will have to deliver the votes in her chamber Another says 188 House Democrats that oppose the Senate taxa broad crosssection led by secondterm Rep Joe Courtney of Connecticut who requested the new JCT data and Rep Sander Levin of Michiganwont allow the House to be steamrolled How did they get into this mess one labor official asked Theyve set this thing up terribly and they have a huge problem in their Caucus The senior Democratic aide said another Senate provision an increase in the Medicare payroll tax for those earning above the 200000 and 250000 thresholds could meet the House test Another idea promoted by Sen Debbie Stabenow DMich would apply the Medicare tax to unearned income such as capital gains and dividends and also has some cache in the House But those proposals also have the disadvantage of being prime revenue sources to help shore up Medicares finances over the long haul which could be negated if used up to help expand healthcare benefits to younger workers House moderates at one point considered a plan authored by the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way to tax excess medical inflation or healthcare premiums that are rising much faster than overall economic growth Sen Thomas Carper DDel an honorary Third Way cochairman has pitched the idea in his chamber as well He continues to argue it could be a fallback position other sources on and off Capitol Hill suggested the train has already left the station and it was too late to inject a new and untested idea into the mix What is striking is the amount of agreement between unions and Republicans on the Senates excise tax however Republicans including Sen John MCCain RAriz have long held that taxing employerprovided health coverage is the best way to keep costs down and raise revenues But in opposing the overall health bill they have latched on to the fact that the excise tax and other taxes in the bill would hit those middleclass workers Obama wants to protect According to JCT data analyzed by Senate Finance Committee Republicans the number of households earning less than 200000 that would be hit with a tax increase number closer to 42 million in 2019 or about 25 percent of all tax filers under that threshold They looked not only at the excise tax but also a scaled back itemized deduction for medical expenses for those with costs not covered by insurance and those affected by the Medicare tax that have losses bringing their income under the thresholds The numbers factor in those who receive premium tax credits and subsidies to offset the cost of buying health coverage in the bill Most of those hit with net tax increases earn between 50000 and 200000 annually Of those households earning under 75000 roughly 12 million would come out ahead JCT found including many who earn too little to pay taxes This new compromise does not fix any of the core problems in this original 2074page Reid bill It is still that long of a bill It is still a 25 trillion massive bill as far as costs are concerned The Reid amendment actually adds 400 more pages These closeddoor negotiations did not produce a better product Quite the opposite It still taxes middleclass families seniors and veterans Millions of people still will not be able to keep what they have as the President promised in the last campaign A lot of people who were hoping to pay less as a result of the word reform will still end up paying more I am not just talking about the young and the healthy It still imposes higher premiums for prescription drug coverage on seniors and the disabled It still permanently cuts all annual Medicare provider payment updates based on productivity gains outside of health care These cuts still go into effect even if it means providers will get a negative payment update and these permanent cuts still threaten Medicare access to care The bill still cuts 120 billion from Medicare Advantage cuts that will reduce Medicare benefits for 11 million beneficiaries contrary to what the President told us in his speech in Septemberthat nobody is going to get cut in Medicare This bill still creates a new body of unelected officials with broad authority to make further cuts in Medicare beyond the 40some billion that are in this bill This bill still unwisely makes the board permanent This bill still requires this board to continue making even more cuts in Medicare and to do that forever into the future The damage this group of unelected people could do to Medicare is unknown but we certainly do know how impossible it will be to undo any damage that unelected board does if Congress decides we ought to undo it That is because whatever cuts they make we have to offset and stirring up that money is very difficult for offsets This bill passes a 26 billion unfunded mandate on to the States because the Reid amendment even made this problem worse by adding 1 billion to that unfunded mandate for States under Medicaid These increased costs will cause States to raise taxes maybe cut education maybe cut transportation and maybe cut law enforcement But it is still money the States have to dig up This bill still has the CLASS Act in it even though the administrations own Health and Human Services Chief Actuary says it runs the riska great riskof being unsustainable It still has a special carveout for committee and leadership staff from having to use the health insurance exchanges This is a cute move on the part of somebody in these closeddoor offices I got an amendment through the Senate Finance Committee on a unanimous basis that if the people of this country have to use the exchange employees and Congressmen on Capitol Hill ought to use it But no when you get to the secrecy behind doors just the Congressmen and their permanent staffs but not the thousands of people who serve on leadership staff or committee staff they still got the deal they have today So they are not going to know what the American people are going through by using the exchange This bill still has special deals for brandname drug makers that will reduce access to generic drugs making drug costs even higher for everyone What this process has shown is that there is a clear and significant philosophical difference between this side of the aisle versus that side of the aisle Those differences are still there and the lines between us on this specific piece of legislation become brighter still even though maybe on 90 percent of the legislation going before this body there is bipartisan cooperation But on this one restructuring onesixth of the economy health care being a life ordeath issue for 306 million Americans this is different from anything this body has tried before On something such as this maybe there is a legitimate reason for having differences Republicans tried to reduce the overall cost They said no They increased the spending in the bill Republicans tried to reduce the pervasive role of government They said no and they increased the role of government Republicans tried to make it harder for illegal immigrants to get benefits They said no and that still has not been fixed Republicans tried to guarantee that Federal funding for abortions would not be allowed under this bill That has been the Federal policy since 1976 That has even had bipartisan support ever since the Hyde amendment was put in place that year But they said no They wouldnt agree to apply that policy That still has not been fixed Republicans tried to allow alternatives to the individual mandate and the harsh penalties associated with it They said no They have subjected even more people to the mandate and they have raised penalties Republicans tried to raise medical malpractice reform They said no Real lawsuit reform is still not in this bill We have watched while the other side has expanded government coverage Since this process began the other side has been working hard to move millions of people from private coverage to government subsidized coverage The bill creates new government programs that cover families making close to 100000 a year When we hear about that in rural America in the Midwest part of the United States they think we have gone bananas in this body by subsidizing families making 100000 At the end of the day after raising billions in new taxes cutting about 12 trillion from Medicare imposing stiff new penalties for people who dont buy insurance and increasing costs for those who do still 23 million people will not have health insurance I dont think this is what the American people had in mind when we promised to fix health care The Reid bill imposes a 25 trillion tab on Americans It kills jobs with taxes and fees that go into effect 4 years before the benefits of the bill take hold It kills jobs with that employer mandate It imposes 12 trillion in higher taxes on premiums on medical devices on prescription drugs and yet more It jeopardizes access to care with massive Medicare cuts It imposes higher costs It raises premiums It bends the cost curve in the wrong way because people would expect you to bend inflation down but this bill takes it up This is not what people have in mind when they think about health care reform We have been hearing repeatedly from the majority whip from Illinois that the Republican side has offered only four amendments I found this to be rather astonishing The majority whip should know because they are filed at the desk that Republicans have put forth 214 amendments In addition to striking some of the bad ideas in the Reid bill these amendments also contain Republican proposals that are improvements over the Reid bill But in this rush to get it done the majority has decided they dont want to consider any more of the 440 amendments filed at the desk Lets be clear We keep them so people can have access to them anytime they want to the 440 amendments that have been filed that we are accused of not offering any suggestions or improvements Right here in these three binders any one of the amendments you want it is there Since this happens to be the case I would like to take them up on their interest in considering additional amendments The majority leader and my friend the Senator from Montana have both said they want this bill to fill the doughnut hole in the Medicare Part D Program I share my colleagues desire to provide even more protection than seniors get under Medicare I filed an amendment that is in this binder amendment No 3182 that would use the savings from medical liability reform which happens to be about the second or third thing that always comes up at my town meetings that the people in this country feel we ought to be working on if we are going to make real the word reform It would put that 50 billion into savings toward eliminating the doughnut hole The amendment puts the needs of 27 million seniors ahead of the needs of trial lawyers I cant speak for my colleagues but that seems like a pretty easy decision To my good friend from Montana I only have one unanimous consent request I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment in order to offer amendment No 3182 which is at the desk I find it disappointing that we would miss the opportunity to forgo 50 billion in savings that could make prescription drugs more affordable for 27 million seniors Even though my friend has just said they are filling the doughnut hole I would quickly say it is being filled in a way that the big pharmaceutical companies are going to make sure they are selling prescription drugs prescribed drugs for a long period of time and not have the savings that ought to come from using generics to a greater extent This 50 billionactually 54 billionthat CBO says we would save with medical malpractice reform would be a better way of filling that doughnut hole I have a parliamentary inquiry of the Chair I want to make a parliamentary inquiry about the pending managers amendment My inquiry will be whether the pending amendment which everyone agrees is critical to the health care reform legislation before us complies with Senate rule XLIV Senate rule XLIV was adopted as part of major ethics and government reform legislation It was passed in 2007 Its title was the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act The Democratic leadership made it the first bill introduced when they took over the majority in 2007 It enjoyed broad bipartisan support I wish the reform had been tougher The part of the legislation that became Senate rule XLIV dealt with the transparency of earmarks They are technically defined as limited tax benefits and congressionally directed spending items Rule XLIV applies to floor amendments such as the pending managers amendment Rule XLIV requires the sponsor of the amendmentin this case Senator Reidto provide a list of these narrow provisions Senator Reid has not provided the list We received the several hundredpage amendment yesterday morning Republican staff have performed a preliminary review That review finds that some items mightI repeat mightbe limited tax benefits There are press reports about narrowly crafted exceptions to the insurance fee I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the Dow Jones article dated December 19 2009 There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows From Dow Jones Newswires Senator Nelson Wins Tax CarveOut for Mutual of Omaha in Health Bill By Martin Vaughan Washington Dow

leaders and Sen Ben Nelson D Neb Under revised Senate health legislation unveiled Saturday by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid D Nev the tax on insurers will begin in 2011 at 2 billion a year eventually rising to 10 billion annually The tax is to be divided up based on each companys market share Senate aides who reviewed the legislation said provisions in the revised bill are specifically crafted to protect Nebraska insurers including Mutual of Omaha The tax carveout appears to be one of several concessions Nelson won from Democratic leaders before agreeing to add his vote the final one needed to secure passage in the Senate to the healthcare measure The biggest issue for us was abortion said Jake Thompson a Nelson spokesman But Sen Nelson also wanted to ensure that Nebraskans wont face increased premiums as a result of a fee that was going to be imposed Nelson inserted a provision that will carve out supplemental Medicare insurance from that tax That provision will benefit Mutual of Omaha but also other insurers that offer socalled Medigap policies Thompson said Nelson also won support for a provision ensuring that Nebraska wont have to foot any costs for new Medicaid enrollees That is important because the Senate bill expands Medicaid eligibility potentially increasing costs for many states under a costsharing system with the federal government Most other states will be required to pick up between 5 and 18 of coverage costs for new Medicaid enrollees with the federal government picking up the remainder The revised bill introduced by Reid also carves out non profit insurers that meet certain criteria especially in Nebraska and Michigan from the new industrywide tax Several states had unique circumstances and Reid thought it was appropriate to provide a narrow exemption from the fee for a couple of states that had unique circumstances a Senate Democratic aide said in a conference call with reporters Nebraska also had circumstances that necessitated the relief the aide said without elaborating This legislation is good for our country and good for Nebraska Nelson said in announcing his support for the healthcare bill Saturday One provision in the bill is narrowly tailored to apply to Blue CrossBlue Shield of Nebraska Nelsons spokesman said It says that a company that is a mutual insurance company and had a market share in a state of between 40 and 60 in 2008 would be exempt from the tax Senate transparency rules enacted after Democrats took over the chamber in 2006 discourage narrowly crafted tax breaks also called tax earmarks Senators are required when offering amendments that include such provisions to publish a list in the Congressional Record and the amendments could be subject to procedural objections The Senate GOP aide said that carving one insurance provider out of the tax could put it at a distinct advantage with respect to competitors The Joint Tax Committee has estimated that the tax could result in increased premiums to consumers of between 1 and 15 If one company is protected from that fee youre talking about a significant pricing differential the aide said Likewise single State Medicaid provisions might be determined to be congressionally directed spending items Under rule XLIV the determinations are not made by the minority staff In order to ensure transparency of narrow provisions the burden is on the sponsor to provide the list This is my parliamentary inquiry Does rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate require that if a Senator proposes an amendment containing congressionally directed spending or a limited tax benefit that the sponsor of those provisions and the names of the Senators requesting them be printed in the Record Has the majority leader provided a list of these special deals and of the Members requesting them for the Record as required by the Senate rules So what is the situation as far as the rule being provided as long as the Senate has not been made aware of this 
S_AK_BEGICH,2009-12-08,2009_2009,0051, Madam President I seek the floor to talk about this package of cost containment offered by the freshmen I am proud to join them in offering this amendment today The technical work in this package is complex and complicated but the themes it addresses are simple and straightforward which I know our colleagues on the other side will appreciate and we hope support value innovation quality transparency and cost containment The full legislation now under debate in the Senate makes wonderful strides in fixing what is broken in Americas current health care system Under the leadership of Senators Baucus Dodd Harkin and our Majority Leader Reid the committees have done incredible work What the freshmen are saying today is we believe our package can help We can go further We can do better Our goal is a health care system that is more efficient and more affordable In a few moments I will stand together at a news conference with all my freshman colleagues to formally announce this package What I most appreciate is that we will do so with the support of consumer and business groups While the language of this amendment promotes efficiency and encourages innovation within the health delivery system what it is about is helping individual Americans and businesses get a better deal on health care I am proud of that especially when we know that cost containment is the No 1 priority of small business owners in this health reform debate Insurance premiums alone in the last 10 years for small businesses have risen 113 percent It was reported in the media that small businesses in this country face another 15percent increase in the health premiums in the coming year What about families our friends and our neighbors Health insurance premiums are eating up ever growing chunks of the family budget Nationwide family health insurance purchased through an employer at the start of this decade cost about 6700 almost 14 percent of the family income Last year the same premium cost 1300021 percent of the family income If we do nothing if we do not reform the system and do not contain costs this country will be in big trouble By 2016 the same family health insurance will cost more than 24000 Because health costs are skyrocketing compared to wages that 24000 will represent 45 percent of the family budget Enough is enough The package we are offering today will help I want to focus briefly on a small but significant piece of this package that addresses rural health care It will help hospitals in several States including Alaska my home State by extending the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program We are building on known success The program is small Even with this amendment the number of eligible hospitals nationwide will expand from 15 to 30 and 20 rural States will be eligible to participate instead of the current 10 Part of what we are saying in this package is this If something is working to provide better health care access and value for goodness sake lets keep it going and do what we can to improve on it My thanks go to Senator Ben Nelson who has been a champion of this program and is also pushing for the extension As I conclude I wish to stress once again how proud I am to stand with my freshman colleagues The cost containment package we are proposing today will help all Americans and I hope it will move the Senate that much closer to a historic vote on the landmark legislation that is before us today I yield the floor

breadth to a statement that was made on the floor earlier today It was made by my friend Senator Baucus I dont take offense to what he said because I sensed a great deal of frustration in his statement I will read what he said so you know what I am reacting to The reason I dont take offense to what he said is because he and I have worked so closely together over 10 years with one or the other of us being chairman of the Finance Committee that we have such an understanding of each other Just prior to the remarks I am going to read he had spoken positively about Senator Enzi and me So I want my colleagues to know this statement is not made out of anger that I am going to give a rebuttal to Well we kept working bipartisanworking together for days and days hours and hours and then fortunately Mr President it got to the point where Im just calling it as I see it I cantIone of my feelings is Im too honest about things And itsthe Republicans started to walk away They pulled away from the table They had to leave I ask you why Why did that happen And the answer is to be totally fair and above board isand above board is because their leadership asked them to Their leadership asked them to become disengaged from the process I know that to be a fact Why did their leadership ask Republicans to leave and become disengaged from the process To be totally candid they wanted to score political points by just attacking this bill They were not here to helphelp be constructive to find bipartisan solutions They were for a while then when the rubber started to meet the road and it came time to try to make some decisions they left and began to attackand began to attack I wish to take a few minutes to respond to these remarks that I read It was asserted through these remarks on the floor that some Republicans in the socalled Gang of 6 were directed by the Senate Republican leadership to cease participating in bipartisan talks The Gang of 6 referred to the six bipartisan members of the Senate Finance Committee On the Democratic side the members were my friends three chairmen including Senator Baucus Budget Committee chairman Senator Conrad and Energy Committee chairman Senator Bingaman All are senior members of the Democratic Caucus On the Republican side the three members included Senator Snowe ranking member of the Small Business Committee Senator Enzi ranking member of the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee and this Senator Senators Snowe and Enzi are senior Members of the Republican caucus Chairman Baucus convened this working group with a singular goal of a bipartisan health care reform bill We met for several weeks up in the Montana Room of Chairman Baucuss office I would agree with the way participating Members have described these discussions They were well informed thoughtful provocative challenging and frustrating all at the same time But I would say that in the months we negotiated there was never once that anyone walked away from the table There was never once that there were any harsh words While we were engaged in those discussions there was constant pressure from folks outside the room for us to reach a quick deal That pressure came from the White House it came from the Democratic leadership it came from advocacy groups outside and it came from many media folks covering the daybyday meetings To be fair the Senate Republican leadership was very concerned about some of the directions the policy discussions were taking in the Gang of 6 That concern grew particularly after the very partisan HELP Committee markup occurred Senator Hatch left the original Gang of 7 because of the character and result of the HELP Committee markup Most important the Senate Republican leadership was concerned that a bipartisan Finance Committee bill would be coopted into a partisan floor bill when the Democratic leadership merged the bills Senators Snowe Enzi and I anticipated that concern To be fair to Senator Baucus as he was negotiating with us he tried to convince us that we would be very much a part of those merging of the bills He offered that in good faith I believe him I even believe him today saying that But seeing how neither the HELP Committee nor the Finance Committee was as involved as they should have been in what Senator Reid put together in this 2074page bill I wonder whether Senator Baucus could have if we had a bipartisan agreement actually carried out that guarantee From the getgo we Republican members of the Gang of 6 to make sure we were a part of the process that I described as Senator Baucus told us we would be asked for assurances from the White House and from the Senate Democratic leadership on the next step in the legislative process if we in fact did arrive at a bipartisan agreement I also found that many in the broader group of Republicans who provided the bipartisan glue for the CHIP bill of 2008 had similar concerns All Republicans had process concerns such as where would it go once it left the Senate Finance Committee We wanted assurances and here is what we wanted The assurances requested boiled down to a goodfaith promise that the bipartisan Finance Committee health care bill would not morph into a partisan health care reform bill when Majority Leader Reid merged the two committee bills We wanted to make sure the bipartisan character of a bipartisan Finance Committee bill was going to be retained through these next steps To do otherwise would be akin to getting on a bus and not knowing where the bus was going or how much the bus ticket would cost Assurances were also requested with respect to a conference between the House and Senate The assurances were similar to assurances requested by Senator Reid and made by the thenmajority Republican leadership during the period of 2005 and 2006 The Democratic minority leader at that time made these assurances a condition to letting major regular order Finance Committee bills even go to conference As an example take a look at the Congressional Record and you will see the assurances made by thenMajority Leader Frist to thenMinority Leader Reid These requests were made repeatedly to the Democratic leadership publicly and privately about how the postcommittee action of the bipartisan group would be handled in the merger with the HELP Committee bill It was a focus of a July 8 lunchtime facetoface meeting at the majority leaders office with Senators Reid Baucus Conrad Bingaman Snowe Enzi and myself The bottomline response from Senator Reid at that meeting was he needed 60 votes I guess the implication was despite the fact that the Democratic caucus contained 60 members then and now Senator Reid didnt think it was possible to secure the votes of all members of his caucus A restatement of the reality of the Senate rules was not the assurances the three Republican Senatorsthis one includedsought from Senator Reid Senator Reid himself recognized the validity of this request in an August 8 Washington Post article I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the Record There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows From the Washington Post Aug 3 2009 Democrats Find Rallying Points on Health Reform but Splinters Remain By Shailagh Murray and Paul Kane Democrats leave town for the August recess with frayed nerves and fragile agreements on healthcare reform and a new bogeyman to fire up their constituents the insurance industry With the House already gone and the Senate set to clear out by Friday the terms of the recess battle are becoming clear Republicans will assail the government coverage plan that Democrats and President Obama are advocating as a recklessly expensive federal takeover of health care And Democrats will counter that GOP opposition represents a de facto endorsement of insurance industry abuses We know what were up against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Calif told reporters on Friday Carpetbombing slash and burn shock and aweanything you want to say to describe what the insurance companies will do to hold on to their special advantage Although Pelosi won a significant victory last week when the Energy and Commerce Committee approved the House bill setting up a floor debate after Labor Day conservative Democrats were able to demand that negotiators weaken the governmentplan provision The uprising which lasted for several days suggested that the public option is growing increasingly vulnerable even as a consensus forms around other reform policies Republican leaders have pledged to use town halls ads and other forums to intensify their assault on the Democraticled reform effort I think its safe to say that over the August recess as more Americans learn more about Democrats plan theyre likely to have a very very hot summer House Minority Leader John A Boehner ROhio said In the Senate a bipartisan coalition of Finance Committee lawmakers is backing a memberrun cooperative model as an alternative to the public option But Republicans are beginning to push back against that cooperative approach too The latest critic is Sen John MCCain RAriz who on Sunday compared insurance coops to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the governmentbacked mortgage giants that played prominent roles in the housing crisis I have not seen a public option that in my view meets the test of what would really not eventually lead to a government takeover MCCain said on CNNs State of the Union Pelosi and other Democrats have countered that Republicans are seeking to protect a health insurance industry that is their business ally not so much from a government insurance option but from the broad industry reforms that enjoy public support including the elimination of coverage caps and the practice of denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions The White House also wants to steer the debate toward insurance reform as it is easier to digest than longterm cost control which is another chief objective How you regulate the insurance industry is as important to healthcare reform as controlling costs said White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel The public plan he said is one of an array of measures intended to change industry behavior As the rhetoric against the industry heated up the leading insurance trade group issued a statement Thursday calling for lawmakers to cool down their criticisms and redouble efforts toward bipartisan healthcare reform Robert Zirkelbach spokesman for Americas Health Insurance Plans defended his industry saying it had already proposed many of the changes that Congress is seeking including those involving pre existing conditions and ratings based on health status and gender Despite the sparring House and Senate Democrats and three GOP Senate negotiators have reached broad consensus on the outlines of reform Lawmakers generally agree that individuals must be required to buy health insurance that Medicaid should be significantly expanded and that tax increases in some form will be required The final bill also could bring about some of the most significant changes to Medicare since the program was created in 1965 But the rebellion from fiscal conservatives on the Energy and Commerce Committee last week served as a political wake up call for Democratic leaders With enough votes on the panel and on the floor to sink reform legislation the Blue Dog Coalition forced Pelosi and Emanuel into concessions that made the government plan similar to private health insurance sparking a new fight with House liberals Sensing that the Blue Dogs had dug in for a prolonged fight Pelosi and Emanuel gave in to most demands in order to get the legislation moving again They essentially decided that it was better to pick a fight with their liberal flank where Pelosi remains popular and where loyalty to Obama is strongest particularly in the Congressional Black Caucus Despite threats from almost 60 progressive House Democratswho outnumber the Blue DogsPelosi defended the compromise saying it was similar to one backed by Sen Edward M Kennedy DMass Pelosi predicted that the liberal wing would fall in line because the legislation is so important to them Are you asking me Are the progressives going to take down universal quality affordable health care for all Americans I dont think so Pelosi told reporters Friday breaking into laughter at the question Just as troublesome as the internal House divisions is the burgeoning distrust among House Democrats their Senate counterparts and the White House Pelosi acknowledged that there are concerns in her caucus that the White House namely their former colleague Emanuel takes House Democrats for granted House lawmakers are being encouraged to pass the most liberal bill possible she said while the White House works on a bipartisan compromise with a select group of senators Its no secret Pelosi said that members sometimes think Why do I always read in the paper that theyre checking with the Finance Committee all the time What does that mean that they just want to know whats happened with the Finance Committee What about the Senate health committee What about our committees over here The six Senate Finance Committee negotiators have burrowed in for another six weeks of talks having set a Sept 15 deadline for producing a bill The group includes an array of smallstate senators with little national prominence who have proven surprisingly resistant to pressure from their party leaders and the White House Although the House bill and the Senate Health Committee version have attracted no Republican support the Senate Finance Committee coalition includes Sens Mike Enzi Wyo and Charles Grassley Iowa both Republicans along with moderate GOP Sen Olympia Snowe Maine And the lead Democratic negotiator Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus Mont is a moderate who has broken with his party on numerous bills coauthored with Grassley The closer these negotiators move to striking a deal the more fraught the discussions become by issues of trust and political will Among Republicans the pressure is especially acute All three GOP senators fear they will be sidelined once the bill is approved at the committee level with their names invoked to demonstrate bipartisanship even as theyre left with no say over the final product as it is meshed with the Senate health panels version and then ultimately with the House bill For Republicans a prime concern is that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Nev will abandon the Finance Committee bill and force legislation to the Senate floor using budget rules that would protect against a Republican filibuster Even advocates concede that the option is highly risky and that it would vastly limit the policy scope of the bill For instance Senate budget experts say most insurance reforms would have to be sidelined Treasury Secretary Timothy F Geithner said Sunday that the administration would consider all options Ideally you want to do this with as broad a base of consensus as possible he said in an interview on ABCs This Week But people on the Hill are going to have to make that choice Do they want to help shape this and be part of it or do they want this country the United States of America to go another several decades without reform Reid said he already provided the Republicans with some assurances and added Ill do more if necessary He said of GOP concerns I dont blame them And he added that considering the political realities of the Senate with its large number of moderate Democrats healthcare reform would have to gain significant bipartisan support to cross the finish line I sure hope we can get a bipartisan bill it makes it easier for me to go home moderate Sen Mary Landrieu D La told the Democratic caucus last week according to Reid We all feel that way Reid added President I will quote in part from the article The closer these negotiators move to striking a deal the more fraught the discussions become by issues of trust and political will Among Republicans the pressure is especially acute All three GOP senators fear they will be sidelined once the bill is approved at the committee level with their names invoked to demonstrate bipartisanship even as theyre left with no say over the final product as it is meshed with the Senate health panels version and then ultimately with the House bill Republicans were also worried that the bipartisan product could be lifted into a partisan reconciliation bill I quote further from that same Post article Reid said he already provided the Republicans with some assurances and added Ill do more if necessary Continuing to quote from the Post article He said of GOP concerns I dont blame them And he added that considering the political realities of the Senate with its large number of moderate Democrats health care reform would have to gain significant bipartisan support to cross the finish line President Obama and the Senate Democratic leadership set a deadline of September 15 for the bipartisan Gang of 6 to produce a proposal If the proposal were not available by then the President and Senate Democratic leadership made it clear the plug would be pulled on further bipartisan talks I point that out because that is very significant A powerful member of the Senate Democratic leadership the senior Senator from New York made it crystal clear the Senate Democratic leadership would pull the plug That member who is very smart and articulate made it as transparent as possible that the September 15 deadline was more important than a bipartisan deal I ask you to go back and look at the media reports The Gang of 6 was unable to reach a deal on contentious issues such as abortion the individual mandate and financing issues by White HouseDemocratic leaderships deadline Chairman Baucus had to move forward I respect the pressure my friend from Montana was under I have been there myself But the record needs to be correctly made that the September 15 deadline was not a Republican deadline It was a deadline imposed by the White House and the Senate Democratic leadership I might say that wasnt just the GOP deadlineit wasnt a deadline for the Gang of 6 either I didnt sense from the three Democratic members that they agreed with that So the Senate Democratic leadership pulled the plug on the talks Again go check the public comments and press reports They pulled the plug Senator Enzi and I could not agree to the product at that point because of substantive issues that were resolved against us and the failure of the White House or Senate Democratic leadership to deliver on those process assurances that we asked for Senator Snowe did have substantive issues resolved sufficiently at the Finance Committee markup so that she could support the bill I might note today that I heard Senator Snowe caution the Democrats as she gave them the boost from her vote in the Finance Committeethat was right after the bill passedshe made it clear that her vote for later stages would depend in part on data on the key question of whether the product makes health care more affordable Her letter to CBO dated December 3 lays out the issues in precision At the next stage of the process the mergedbill stage all of the Senate Republicans worst fears were confirmed but it was especially telling to Senator Enzi and me My sense is Senator Snowe appreciated it more than any other member of our conference The bottom line was that the majority leaders merged bill was constructed in such a partisan way that Senator Snowes input was cast aside Lets be clear Senate Republicans did not set deadlines Senate Republicans did not threaten to go their own way if the deadlines were not met Even today the pending motion from this side of the aisle puts the question to the Senate this way Take the bill back to the Finance Committee As the old saying goes hindsight is 2020 As I look back on the process I make these observations There was an uncanny disconnect between those inside and outside the room Many on the outside mainly from the left side of the political spectrum seemed to want a reform deal just to have a deal They did not seem to be that curious about the contents Perhaps for some of those folks it was a bit of an imperative to draw on the good will that any President has in the first few months of office For those of us in the roommeaning the room where the negotiations were going onthere was a realization that we were tackling as Chairman Baucus has described it an extremely complex set of issues We learned very quickly that closing the loop on the policy issues let alone finding political consensus was not easy The pressure to close a deal by the July 4 recess was overwhelming My friend the chairman wisely pushed back and said we would get a deal when we reached a bipartisan deal The Group of 6 was unable to reach a deal on contentious issues such as abortion individual mandate and financing issues faced by the White HouseDemocratic leadership deadline Chairman Baucus had to move In my heart I feel he would rather not have had that sort of pressure or make that decision But that was not our deadline It was a deadline imposed by the White House and the Senate Democratic leadership They pulled the plug on the talks Go check the public comments and the press reports They pulled the plug Senator Enzi and I could not agree to a product at that point because of the substantive issues that were very much involved I want to make it very clear for this Senator of the three Republicans who were negotiating kind of in summary that the Republican leadership I think had questions about a lot of things that were going on in those negotiations But never once did Senator MCConnell my leader say to me Get out of there That is the impression that was left this morning I can only say that I think I have established a reputation in the Senate particularly while I was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that I did not listen to either the White House or people in leadership necessarily when I thought a bipartisan compromise was the only way to get things done I suppose there is a whole long list of things that I ought to write down before I make this statement but I can only think of two or three right now that I can be sure of that I can say in an intellectually honest way that I stood up to the Bush White House when I was chairman of the committee They came out immediately for a 17 trillion tax cut in 2001 I made a decision early on that it was not good for the economy and it was not politically possible So we passed a much smaller in a bipartisan way tax bill for that year And yet it was the biggest tax cut in the history of the country In 2003 when the White House and House Republicans in the majority at that time said we had to have a 700 billion tax cut in addition to the tax cut that was passed in 2001 there were not votes in the Senate among just Republicans to get it done To secure the votes to get it done we had to limit it to half that amount of money or just a little bit more than half that amount of money And in order to get those votes contrary to the 700 billion tax cut that the Bush White House wanted and the House Republicans wanted that we could not get through here I said I will not come out of conference with a tax cut more than that amount of roughly 300 billion We got that done by just the bare majority to get it done But I stood up to the White House I stood up to the House Republican leadership who thought we should not be doing anything that was short of that full 700 billion There have been other health care bills very recently where I stood up against the White House and against our Republican leadership I think I have developed a reputation where I am going to do what is right for the State of Iowa and for our country And I am going to try to represent a Republican point of view as best I can considering first the country and my own constituency Then when it comes to whether people in this body or outside of this body might think that for the whole months of May June and July and through August with a couple meetings we had during the month of August that we were dragging our feet to kill a health care reform bill I want to ask people if they would think I wouldnt have better things to do with my time than to have 24 different meetings one on one with Chairman Baucus or that I wouldnt have more than something else to do than have 31 meetings with the Group of 6 These were not just short meetings These were meetings that lasted hours There was another group of peopleGrassley Baucus and others sometimes that included people from the HELP Committee and the Budget Committee But we had 25 meetings like that I wonder if people think we would just be meeting and spending all those hours to make sure that nothing happened around here No Every one of the 100 Senators in this body if you were to ask them would suggest changes in health care that need to be made Even in that 2074page bill there are some things that most conservative people in this country would think ought to be done We all know to some extent something has to be done about this system We worked for a long period of time thinking we could have something bipartisan But it did not work out that way and now we are at a point where we have a partisan bill That is not the way you should handle an issue such as health care reform Just think of the word health health care It deals with the life and death of 306 million Americans Just think you are restructuring onesixth of the economy Senator Baucus and I started out in January and February saying to everybody we met every group we talked to that something this momentous ought to be passing with 75 or 80 votes not just 60 votes Maybe one of the times the White House decided to pull the plug on September 15 may have come on August 5 when the Group of 6 had our last meeting with President Obama He was the only one from the White House there and the six of us It was a very casual discussion I said this before so I am not saying something that has not been said But President Obama made one request of me and I asked him a question For my part I said You know it would make it a heck of a lot easier to get a bipartisan agreement if you would just say you could sign a bill without a public option That is no different than what I said to him on March 5 when I was down at the White House that the public option was a major impediment to getting a bipartisan agreement Then he asked me would I be willing to be one of three Republicans along with the rest of the Democrats to provide 60 votes My answer was upfront No As I told him you can clarify with Senator Baucus sitting right here beside you that 4 or 5 months before that I told Senator Baucus Dont plan on three Republicans providing the margin that we were here to help get a broadbased consensus as Senator Baucus and I said early on this year that something this massive ought to pass with a wide bipartisan majority Mr President I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum President I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Bennet Without objection it is so ordered In the part of my statement where I refer to the July 8 meeting with Senator Reid it was only Snowe Grassley and Enzi not the other Senators I named So I wish to correct that for the Record I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded President I have said for the last 2 days I was going to speak on the Dorgan amendment a bipartisan amendment to allow the importation of drugs into the United States I havent done it until now so I am glad to rise in support of this bipartisan amendment to add provisions of the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act to this bill That legislation is the result of a collaborative effort by Senators Dorgan Snowe MCCain and this Senator to finally make drug importation legal I have for a long time been a proponent of drug reimportation In 2000 2002 and 2003 I supported an amendment permitting the importation of prescription drugs into the United States from one country Canada This amendment is much broader than only Canada In 2004 the late Senator Kennedy and I worked together on a bill that would authorize drug importation but it did not survive the partisan politics of this Chamber I then introduced my own comprehensive drug importation bill in 2004 That was S 2307 the Reliable Entry for Medicines at Everyday Discounts Through the Importation with Effective Safeguards Act The REMEDIES Act is what the acronym finally spells out In 2005 I combined my bill with a proposal sponsored by Senators Dorgan and Snowe In 2007 we reintroduced a version of that legislation with the hope that our combined efforts would finally lower the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans That is what we are still working together to do this very day I thank Senator Dorgan for his leadership This time around I should be confident that this effort will finally pass Historically Democrats claim to be champions of holding the big pharmaceutical companies accountable Now we have a Democratic supermajority in the Congress and a Democratic President who has supported drug importation in the past I am not as confident as maybe I should be That is because the White House has participated in some backroom negotiations since the last time this legislation was brought before the Senate and then Senator Obama supported it Behind closed doors the Democratic White House found new friends in the pharmaceutical industry Last summer the head of the pharmaceutical lobbying group bragged that drug manufacturers had negotiated a rock solid dealthose are their wordswith the present administration An article in the New York Times detailed the administrations deal with big drug companies This quote comes from the New York Times Foreseeing new profits from the expansion of health coverage big drug companies are spending as much as 150 million on advertisements to support the Presidents plan But in 2008 when President Obama was campaigning for the position he now holds he promised that Well take on drug and insurance companies hold them responsible for the prices they charge and the harm they cause Certainly the President knows that a great way to hold drug companies accountable is to allow drug importation In fact in 2004 when he was a candidate to be a Member of this Chamber he challenged his opponents to support drug importation He said at that time I urge my opponent to stop siding with the drug manufacturers and put aside his opposition to the re importation of lowerpriced prescription drugs But unfortunately it has been reported that during backroom negotiations at the White House the big pharmaceutical companies have convinced the President to drop his strong support for drug importation The New York Times reports that On July 7 Meaning this year Rham Emanuel President Obamas chief of staff assured at least five pharmaceutical companies during a White House meeting that there would be no provision in the final health care package to allow the reimportation of cheaper drugs I thought we were going to hold drug companies accountable I thought health care reform was supposed to drive down the cost of health care including the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans The Dorgan amendment is a commonsense bipartisan approach to achieve both of these goals Drug importation achieves these goals without imposing arbitrary fees and without flexing the muscles of the Federal Government I have always considered this a free trade issue I know most people see it as a health issue and it is a health issue But I come at it from the point of view that there are only a couple items Americans cannot buy in this country from anyplace else in the world they want to buy it One class is pharmaceutical drugs the other class is Cuban President I ask unanimous consent for 4 additional minutes and that it come off the next block of time from our side Imports create competition and keep domestic industry more responsive to consumers In the United States we import everything consumers want So I ask again why not pharmaceuticals That is why it is a trade issue for me as much as a health issue Consumers in the United States pay far more for prescription drugs than those in other countries If Americans could legally and safely access prescription drugs outside the United States then drug companies would be forced to reevaluate their pricing strategies They would no longer be able to gouge American consumers by making them pay more than their fair share for research and development It is true that pharmaceutical companies do not like the idea of opening up America to the global marketplace They want to keep the United States closed to other markets in order to charge higher prices here Based on the reports I just read it seems that the White House has already sided with the drug manufacturers and promised them the ability to continue to gouge American consumers otherwise known as the status quo The debate is not over With the Dorgan amendment prescription drug companies will be forced to be competitive and establish fair prices in America The drug companies will try to find loopholes in order to protect their bottom line The Dorgan amendment would make such action illegal It would not allow manufacturers to discriminate against registered exporters or importers It would prohibit drug companies from engaging in any actions to restrict prohibit or delay the importation of a qualifying drug The Dorgan amendment would give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to prevent this kind of abuse It develops an effective and safe system that gives Americans access to lower prices Our effort goes to great lengths to ensure the safety of imported drugs The Dorgan amendment requires that all imported drugs be approved by the FDA It puts in place a stringent set of safety requirements that must be met before Americans can import drugs from that country The amendment requires all exporting pharmacies and importing wholesalers to be registered with the FDA and inspected It gives the authority for the FDA to inspect the entire distribution chain for imported drugs It sets very stringent penalties for violations of the safety requirements in this bill including criminal penalties and up to 10 years imprisonment We need to make sure Americans have even greater more affordable access to innovative drugs by further opening the doors to competition in the global pharmaceutical industry If my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are serious about bending down the cost curve of health care inflationand doing it in that direction the right directionthen they will support the Dorgan amendment a bipartisan amendment I yield the floor President my friends on the other side of the aisle have consistently stated that this 2074page Reid bill according to the Joint Committee on Taxation is a net tax cut I want to put emphasis throughout my remarks on the word net Yesterday a chart was used to illustrate this point This chart had multiple bars with dollar figures For example in 2019 the chart showed a 408 billion net tax cut My Democratic friends said this number came from the Joint Committee on Taxation a very responsible intellectually honest group Unfortunately the chart my friends were using was not entirely clear on how they came up with this net tax cut for Americans So it was natural for most of the fellow Senators and the country at large to wonder how my Democratic friends got this number They said show me the data To clear up any confusion right here is the Joint Committee on Taxation table that the Democrats relied on to claim that the Reid bill results in a net tax cut Here it is We can see the negative 40786 for example That is the figure that was used As the chart indicates these dollar amounts are in the millions so 40786 million The Joint Committee on Taxation says it this way This means negativethe negative mark therenegative 408 billion My friends on the other side unfortunately did not explain what was going on here It appears my friends simply made an assertion that they hoped many of us and those in the media would believe But I cannot let my Democratic friends get off the hook this easily Why Because the entire story is not being told so let me take a moment to explain First in simplest terms where you see negative numbers on this chart the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us there is some type of tax benefit going to the taxpayers So this group and these groups here wherever there is a negative here those are tax benefits to the benefit of the taxpayers For example families making 50000 to 75000 have a negative of 10489 in their column This means the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us that this income category is receiving 104 billion in tax benefits I hope you will listen closely When we see a negative number on this chart the Joint Committee on Taxation tells us there is a tax benefit so conversely where we see a positive number the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us that these taxpayers are seeing a tax increase I have actually enlarged those numbers the number of tax returns and the dollar amounts where there is a positive number for individuals and families Again these positive numbers indicate tax increase My friends have said that all tax returns in this chart are receiving a net tax cut If that were so why arent there negative numbers next to all of the dollar amounts listed Because not everyone in this chart is receiving a tax cut despite what my friends have said Quite to the contrary a group of taxpayers is clearly seeing a tax increase and this group of taxpayers in middle income is seeing tax increases I didnt come down to the floor to say my friends on the other side of the aisle are wrong After all you can see here the negative 40786 million figure they used is right there out in the open What I am doing is clarifying that my Democratic friends cannot spread this 408 billion tax cut across all the affected taxpayers on this chart and then say that all have received a tax cut You want to know why Because this chart produced by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation shows that taxes go up for those making more than 50000 and families making more than 75000 It is right here in the yellow as you can see The numbers obviously do not lie I say the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation I think everybody agrees is very intellectually honest So let me give you my read on what the Joint Committee on Taxation is saying here as evidenced by the figures on the chart First there is a group of low and middleincome taxpayers who clearly benefits under the 2074page bill that is before the Senate They benefit from the government subsidy of health insurance This group however is relatively small There is another much larger group of middleincome taxpayers who are seeing their taxes go up due to one or a combination of the following tax increases the highcost plan tax increase which actually is a brandnew tax the medical expense deduction limitation which used to be 75 percent and now before you can deduct you have to have 10 percent of your income be medical expenses or you dont deduct anything so that is a tax increase and then a Medicare payroll tax increase where everybody is going to paywell everybody over a certain income is going to pay an additional half a percentage point or if you are selfemployed pay 1 percent more of payroll tax In general this group is not benefiting from the government subsidy After all how can a taxpayer see a tax cut if they are not even eligible for the subsidy Also there is an additional group of taxpayers who would be affected by other tax increase provisions in the Reid bill that the Joint Committee on Taxation could not distribute in the way people are distributed on this chart These undistributed tax increases include among others the cap on Federal savingsflexible savings accounts Then there is a tax on cosmetic surgery My friend from Idaho the author of the amendment before us Mr Crapo recently received a letter from the Joint Committee on Taxation stating that this additional group exists and many in this group will make less than 250000 and hence have a tax increase that is not accounted for here and also a tax increase if they are under 250000 That is a violation of the Presidents promise in the last campaign that nobody under that figure would get a tax increaseonly people over 250000 So you see my Democratic friends cannot No 1 say that all taxpayers receive a tax cutI have proven that hereand No 2 say that middleincome Americans will not see a tax increase under the Reid bill I yield the floor Madam President I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded Madam President I know we have moved to the Omnibus appropriations bill to continue government and the time is running out for the current authorization bill and this brings us back to the authorization of spending but it also takes us away from health care reform On this side of the aisle we have been waiting for a long period of time to vote on some amendments that are now before the Senate such as the Crapo motion which would send the bill back to committee to take out the tax increases that are in it Then we also have the Dorgan amendment I can understand why maybe the majority does not want to vote on Republican amendments but I sure dont understand why they would object to voting on Senator Dorgans amendment a Democratic amendment because there have always been more Democrats than Republicans for the Dorgan amendment and quite frankly I am in a position where I agree with that amendment I am a cosponsor of it I think we would have a great deal of bipartisan support for the Dorgan amendment But now we are just automatically away from the health care debate and those amendments So I am wondering why we had to do this appropriations bill right now I think there is growing realization that maybe public reaction negative reaction to the legislation before usremember that 2074 page bill that is before usthe public is getting wise to what is in that bill and there is objection to it and maybe now the majority party would like to have a little respite from that debate So I thought I would come back to not the substance of the health care reform bill debate but to a lot of organizations that oppose it and why they oppose it just to keep the publics attention that we on this side of the aisle feel the health care issue is very important As I travel around Iowa I hear a lot of concern about outofcontrol government spending People are worried about all of the bailouts the banks and the automakers the automakers such as General Motors being nationalized They are worried about the rising rate of unemployment which is 10 percent now They dont see how we will ever dig ourselves out of the deficit hole we are in a deficit that has been increased by 13 trillion since President Obamas inauguration As Senator MCCain just pointed out the bill that has now come before the Senate to fully fund the Federal Government has 125percent increases in it From that standpoint it seems to me we are getting away from a commonsense principle that we ought to use around here on spending and that is that spending shouldnt eat up any more than the economic growth of the tax base that is coming into the Federal Treasury to support that spending Quite obviously you cant have 125 percent increases in appropriations this year over last year and last year was 9 percent over the previous year You just cant sustain that Common sense dictates against it But what rules here in Washington is just a lot of nonsense So our constituents are confused They are confused as to why in the face of all these fiscal problems some in Congress are now proposing 500 billion in tax increases Tax increases are very bad for the economy It is more difficult to get out of the recession as you increase expenditures They dont understand why some are proposing the largest Medicaid expansion since the programs creation They want to know why they are proposing 500 billion in Medicare cuts to create an entirely new entitlement program that this country cant afford Nowhere are these worries and this confusion more evident than among business leaders of America because business is where jobs are created Government does not produce wealth government consumes wealth So if you want to expand the economy you do it through the private sector That is where the resources of government come from That is where the resources that sustain our people come from So whether it is a small business owner on Main Street or a CEO on Wall Street the message is clear Stop spending get the economy back on track and get people back to work Unfortunately the health reform bill will not address any of these goals In fact it may just do the opposite Dont take my word for it Lets take a look at what the groups that represent American businesses are saying Lets start with the Chamber of Commerce representing 3 million American businesses In a press release distributed November 19 1 day after the release of the Senate bill the Chamber called the Senate bill a Missed Opportunity to Enact Meaningful Reform That was their title Let me go to a specific quote This bill still contains a governmentrun plan and an onerous employer mandate it taxes working Americans slashes Medicare spends over a trillion dollarsand after all thisCBO tells us 24 million Americans will still not have health insurance That doesnt sound like the kind of reform that is going to help get the chamber members back on track hiring more workers so we can get this unemployment down It sounds as though they will end up being forced to pay higher taxes and cut jobs I am not an economist but that certainly doesnt sound like a formula for getting this country out of the recession In fact the chambers press release says The Chamber believes the path to a healthier economy is to cut taxes not to raise them by 500 billion They go on to ask a question for which I still cant find an answer Why is there still no meaningful medical liability reform Is currying favor with the trial lawyers worth passing up 50 billion in CBO verified savings I think it is pretty clear that the Chamber of Commerce doesnt think this 25 trillion bill will cure what ails the US economy Lets see what some other business groups have to say The National Association of Manufacturers put out a press release the same day as the Chamber of Commerce November 19 The National Association of Manufacturers is the Nations largest industrial trade association Their members build the machines that keep America running so they should know a little bit about how to get our economy running again Unfortunately they see Senator Reids bill as a step in the wrong direction Like the Chamber and like pretty much every other business group the National Association of Manufacturers has announced that they cannot support the pending bill I find it hard to believe that some Senators who claim to be probusiness can support a bill that is opposed by almost the entire business communityor am I missing something How can some Democrats who claim to want to get people back to work support a bill that economists from the far right to the far left say will reduce wages and increase unemployment It just doesnt seem to make sense Like other business groups the National Association of Manufacturers is in favor of reform Manufacturers realize that we need health reform to lower costs increase access and improve quality But according to their press release they cannot support a bill that willthis is their quoteadd massive financial burdens to businesses that are already struggling in this recession They go on to express deep concern about huge tax increases that will hurt small business manufacturers and they are worried that both the socalled public option and the massive Medicaid expansion will just end up shifting more costs and higher premiums to private businesses The National Association of Manufacturers ends their press release by saying Oppose the majority leaders bill and urge Senators to do the same as it raises costs and ultimately will destroy jobs Again I find myself asking how someone can claim to be probusiness but support a bill that is so strongly opposed by the business community Lets take a look at what small businesses have to say Maybe that is where the answer is You have to remember that small businesses create 70 percent of the net new jobs in America In fact it was Christina Romer the Presidents top economic adviser who said in a recent Webcast that health care reform will benefit small businessnot burden it Unfortunately the National Federation of Independent Businesses the voice of small businesses doesnt seem to agree After the release of Senator Reids bill the National Federation of Independent Businesses said this This kind of reform is not what we need to encourage small business to thrive We oppose the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act due to the amount of new taxes the creation of new mandates and the establishment of new entitlement programs Like the chamber and the National Association of Manufacturers small businesses want and need reform probably more so than even chamber members and the National Association of Manufacturers But it doesnt sound as though the pending bill actually addresses the problems of small business In fact it sounds as though the pending bill simply creates a host of new problemsproblems at a time when this country is coming back from the brink of the greatest economic downturn since the Depression The National Federation of Independent Businesses goes on to say There is no doubt all of these burdens will be paid for on the backs of small businesses Over the coming weeks I am sure some Senators are going to come down here and talk about all of the benefits for small businesses that are in this bill But in the interest of honest debate I hope they will at least mention in their remarks that despite all of the socalled benefits this bill is still opposed by the voices of Americas small businesses It is still opposed by the National Federation of Independent Businesses I could go on and list about half a dozen other business groups that oppose this bill The Associated Builders and Contractors the Independent Electrical Contractors the International Franchise Association the National Association of Wholesalers the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council and the International Food Service Distribution Associationall of these groups recognize the devastating impact this bill will have on our economy We are facing the highest unemployment rate in 26 years We have already seen the national debt increase by 13 trillion since inauguration or per household 11535 The pending bill misses the mark on business top priority and that is lowering costs Dont take my word for it The Congressional Budget Office says the Reid bill bends the Federal spending curve further upward by a net of 160 billion between 2010 and 2019 For these reasons the pending bill is opposed by these organizations I have quoted the National Association of Manufacturers the Chamber of Commerce the National Federation of Independent Businesses as well as almost every other business group based in Washington DC or maybe for all I know they are based in other parts of the country but they still follow legislation here in this city in the Congress The business community has spoken and their message is loud and clear For Senators who want to bend the growth curve downand that is what we all set out to do but we dont have a bill before us that does itthis bill is not the answer For those Senators who want to get people back to work this bill is not the answer For those Senators who want to get this countrys economy back on track this bill is not the answer If you support American businessesand American businesses are what provide the income into the Federal Treasury whether it is corporate tax or income taxit seems to me that if you have pride in American businesses and the jobs they create you cannot support this bill I yield the floor The PRESIDING OFFICER Mrs MCCaskill The Senator from Washington is recognized Madam President earlier today I explained to my fellow Senators and hopefully to my friends in the media that the Reid bill does not provide a net tax cut for Americans Contrary to the Democrats claims that seems to be the situation They claim there is a net tax cut I hope I proved earlier today that it does not have a net tax cut Some Americans are cut but dont forget that some Americans have increases in taxes I pointed directly to this data as prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation to show that a group of middleincome taxpayers will see their taxes go up under the Reid bill and that would be this class of taxpayers right here I dont disagree with Democrats saying there is 40786 million of tax cuts but there are also tax increases for a large share of Americans I want to now build on those earlier remarks As I stated there is clearly a group of individuals and families who benefit from the government subsidy for health care However that group is relatively small Another much larger group would see their taxes go up So I want to take a minute to provide some statistics that we pulled from the data of the Joint Committee on Taxation looking at both the winners and the losers under the bill For the benefit of the public the Joint Committee on Taxation is an intellectually honest group of professionals who are nonpartisan and they give Congress information on the impact of policies we make here in our various committees or as individuals or the Senate as a whole According to this professional group the Joint Committee on Taxation out of those individuals and families affected by four major tax provisions under the Reid bill individuals earning more than 50000 and families earning more than 75000 would see on average their taxes going up Only individuals with incomes below 50000 and families with incomes below 75000 would on average see some tax relief on account of receiving subsidies for health insurance The data of the Joint Committee on Taxation indicates that in 2019 individuals earning less than 50000 would on average receive tax relief through this subsidy equal to 875 Families earning less than 75000 would on average receive tax relief equal to 2031 from the subsidy This socalled tax relief however is in the form of an advance refundable tax credit that is delivered directly to the insurance company providing health insurance coverage not to the individual but signed sealed and delivered directly to the insurance company100 percent of it I repeat not to the individual but to the insurance company Clearly this group is a winner under the Reid bill But the same data from the Joint Committee on Taxation indicates that in 2019 individuals earning between 50000 and 200000 would on average see a tax increase of 593 That is for individuals Now lets go to families earning between 75000 and 200000 They would on average see a tax increase of 670 So what does all this mean This means the Reid bill does not cut taxes for all Americans To the contrary the Reid bill breaks Obamas promise not to tax individuals making less than 200000 and families making less than 250000 a year And you just cant know how many times President Obama during his Presidential campaignwhether in debates or in individual appearances when he was a candidatemade it very clear that nobody with under 200000 a year in income was going to see a tax increase To the contrary the Reid bill breaks President Obamas pledge not to tax individuals making less than 200000 and then a higher figure for families making less than 250000 Does the tax relief provided to individuals earning less than 50000 and families making less than 75000 represent a tax cut Generally no because based upon the report of the Joint Committee on Taxation of the 395 billion the government will spend on tax credits for health insuranceor subsidies for health insurance288 billion will be refundable meaning individuals and families who have no tax liability will still receive the full benefit The Joint Committee on Taxation tells us that the remaining 106 billion will go toward reducing real tax liability The Congressional Budget Office classifies a benefit provided to tax filers with no tax liability as government spending not as a tax decrease This is compared to a tax benefit that actually will reduce a taxpayers tax liability This means the 288 billion of government spending through the Tax Code cannot be considered a true tax reduction The Democrats count the 288 billion in government spending when claiming the Reid bill provides a tax cut And the reason is if the Democrats do not count this government spending as a tax cut they could not hide the fact that the Reid bill increases taxes Bottom line The Reid bill does not provide a net tax cut Instead the bill raises taxes and it raises taxes on individuals and families earning less than 250000 contrary to Candidate Obamas presentation during the campaign that nobody below that figure would get a tax increase Check the data No one can dispute it It is right here in these figures Everybody in the United States is represented by these figures here highlighted They are the ones who are going to get a tax increase That is the rest of the story I yield the floor Madam President my friends on the other side of the aisle have taken to the floor to make the argument in favor of the Reid bill that it eliminates a socalled hidden tax What is this socalled hidden tax The other party argues that there is a hidden health tax that families pay in increased premium costs to cover the costs of caring for the uninsured In short when doctors and hospitals provide treatment to the uninsured they are forced to compensate for this uncompensated care and do so by charging more to private health insurers The cost of this care that is shifted to the insurers is then passed on to health care consumers in the form of higher health insurance premiums Unfortunately this socalled hidden tax is often overstated Families USA conducted a study attempting to quantify the cost shift associated with uncompensated care According to this study about 43 billion in uncompensated care is shifted to private health insurance which led Families USA to conclude that there is a hidden tax of about 1100 that families pay in increased premiums A Kaiser Family Foundation study dissected the Families USA numbers and estimated that the total amount of uncompensated care shifted to private insurers was closer to 11 billion making the socalled hidden tax around 200 for a family compared to the 1100 that Families USA said Let me give some ground to my friends on the other side and assume that the hidden tax does equal that higher figure 1100 as compared to the Kaiser Family Foundation figure of 200 The Democrats bill does not get rid of the hidden tax entirely Actually this bill makes it worse How First the Democrats health care reform bill still leaves a large number of Americans uninsured Specifically the Reid bill leaves 23 million out of 54 million still without health insurance at the end of this decade remembering that this bill does not actually take effect until 2014 So between 2014 and at the end of the budget window we still have 23 million people without health insurance At best the reform in this 2074page Democratic bill cut the hidden tax in half in this case to about 500 for a family The Reid bill adds however new hidden taxes These impose 67 billion worth of socalled fees on health insurance companies and self insured arrangements beginning in 2010 The Congressional Budget Office the Joint Committee on Taxation the nonpartisan experts and official congressional scorekeepers have testified that these fees will be passed on to health care consumers The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation have further testified that this will result in higher insurance premiums for all Americans The actuaries at OliverWyman estimate that the fees imposed on health insurers would add 488 to the cost of the average family health insurance policy A new hidden tax is also created as a result of the Medicaid expansion and Medicare cuts The major cost shift in health care derives from the government programs Medicare and Medicaid which reimburse providers at rates roughly 20 percent to 40 percent lower than what private providers pay to the same doctors and hospitals President Obama understands that paying doctors below market rates leads to a cost shift After all in a townhall on health care reform the President said If theyre only collecting 80 cents on the dollar theyve got to make it up somewhere and they end up getting it from people who have private insurance The Medicare and Medicaid cost shift will be increased significantly under the Democrats health care reform bill According to CBOs estimate Medicaid will be increased by more than 40 percent from 35 million to 50 million people by the end of the budget window in 2019 Additionally the bill includes almost 12 trillion in Medicare cuts which will result in lower payments to providers The actuaries at Milliman Consulting studied the current cost shifting resulting from Medicare and Medicaid underpaying providers and found that this cost shift for Medicare and Medicaid totaled almost 89 billion per year adding 1788 to the current family health insurance policy Increasing the current Medicare and Medicaid cost shift as a result of this 2074page health reform bill before us would add even more cost to a family health insurance policy The easier cost shift to address would be the 1700 cost shift from defensive medicine The Democrats do not address cost shift from defensive medicine which Dr Mark MCClellan former head of CMS and Daniel Kessler estimated adds 1700 in additional cost per average family Addressing this reform alone could save more than covering all of the uninsured So you see the Democrats say their bill will eliminate the socalled hidden tax My friends seem to come up short on that one Also my friends add new hidden taxes that will burden middleclass Americans I ask my friends to be transparent when they are talking about getting rid of the hidden tax The Democratic health reform bill actually makes things worse I yield the floor The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Whitehouse The Senator from Utah President I dont rise to add to what the Senator from New Jersey said I just wish to take this opportunity to tell him I agree with him and I appreciate his leadership on this issue over several yearseven the years before he came to the Senate Often I am asked in my State because we can export so much agricultural stuff if I would vote to open trade with Cuba I said I am willing to open trade for Cuba when they give political freedom and economic freedom to the people of that country because this dictator has run Cuba into the most impoverished country in the world Before he took over they had a very viable middle class and they were a prosperous country I stand ready to help the Senator on what he is trying to do in that area 
S_UT_HATCH,2009-12-11,1977_2009,0222, President I appreciate the remarks of my distinguished colleague from Florida People need to listen to him I am grateful to have him in the Senate a fine man he is and a good example to all of us I appreciate his remarks I rise to explain why I believe the Reid health care bill is not only bad policy for this country but also undermines the Constitution and the liberty it makes possible I urge my colleagues to resist two errors that can distort our judgment and lead us down the wrong path Those errors are assuming that the Constitution allows whatever we want to do and ignoring this question altogether We have only the powers the Constitution grants us because liberty requires limits on government power and we have our own responsibility to make sure we stay within those limits James Madison said that if men were angels no government would be necessary and if angels were to govern men no limits on government would be necessary Because neither men nor the governments they create are angelic government and limits on government are both necessary to protect libertynot just government but limits on government as well Those limits come primarily from a written Constitution which delegates enumerated powers to the Federal Government Here is how the Supreme Court put it just a few years ago This is in United States v Morrison in 2000 quoting Marbury v Madisonone of the most important decisions ever by the Supreme Court probably the single most important decisionback in 1803 Every law enacted by Congress must be based on one or more of its powers enumerated in the Constitution The powers of the legislature are defined and limited and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten the constitution is written The important word there happens to be limits No one likes limits least of all politicians with grand plans and aggressive agendas It is tempting to ignore or forget the limits the Constitution imposes on us by pretending the Constitution means whatever we want it to mean But we take an oath to support and defend the Constitution not to make the Constitution support and defend us The Constitution cannot limit government if government controls the Constitution In April 1992 during a debate on welfare reform legislation the senior Senator from New York Mr Moynihan with whom I served made a point of order that an amendment offered by a Republican Senator was unconstitutional Here is what Senator Moynihan said We do not take an oath to balance the budget and we do not take an oath to bring about universal peace but we do take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States Applying that sage advice today we do not take an oath to reform the health care system or to bring about universal insurance coverage but we do take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States For the past 8 years my friends on the other side of the aisle insisted that the Constitution sets definite and objective limits that the President must obey The Constitution they said does not mean whatever the President wants it to mean Compelling circumstances or even national crises they said cannot change the fact that the Constitution controls the President not the other way around It is easy to insist that the Constitution controls another branch of government that the Constitution does not mean whatever another branch of government wants it to mean The real test of our commitment to liberty however is our willingness to point that same finger at ourselves I ask my colleagues is the Constitution rock solid unchanging and supreme for the executive branch but malleable shapeshifting and in the eye of the beholder for the legislative branch A principle applied only to others is just politics and politics alone cannot protect liberty We must be willing to say that there are lines we may not cross means we may not use and steps we may not take The Constitution empowers Congress to do many things for the American people Just as important however is that the Constitution also sets limits on our power We cannot take the power without the limits I want to address several constitutional issues raised by this legislation The first is the requirement in section 1501 that individuals obtain not simply health insurance but a certain level of insurance Failure to meet this requirement results in a financial penalty which is to be assessed and collected through the Internal Revenue Code We hear a lot about how Senators on this side of the aisle are supposedly defending the big evil insurance companies while those on the other side of the aisle are defenders of American families This insurance mandate exposes such partisan hypocrisy Let me just ask you one simple question Who would benefit the most from the unprecedented mandate to purchase insurance or face a penalty enforced by our friends at the Internal Revenue Service The answer is simple There are two clear winners under this Draconian policy and neither is the American family The first winner is the Federal Government which could easily use this authority to increase the penalty or impose similar ones to create new streams of revenue to fund more outofcontrol spending Second the insurance companies are the most direct winners under this insurance mandate because it would force millions of Americans who would not otherwise do so to become their customers I cannot think of a bigger windfall for corporations than the Federal Government ordering Americans to buy their products Right now States are responsible for determining the policies that best meet the particular demographic needs and challenges of their own residents That is the States Massachusetts for example has decided to implement a health insurance mandate while Utah has decided not to do so This bill would eliminate this State flexibility so that the Federal Government may impose yet another onesizefitsall mandate on all 50 States and on every American I cannot think of anything more at odds with the system of federalism that Americas Founders established a system designed to limit government and protect liberty I can understand why this mandate is so attractive to those who believe in an allpowerful Federal Government After all raising the percentage of those with health insurance is easy by simply ordering those without insurance to buy it But while government may choose the ends the Constitution determines the permissible means That is why one of the basic principles is that Congress must identify at least one of our powers enumerated in the Constitution as the basis for any legislation we ultimately pass The health insurance mandate is separate from the penalty used to enforce it The only enumerated power that can conceivably justify the mandate is the power to regulate interstate commerce For more than a century the Supreme Court treated this as meaning what it says Congress cannot use its power to regulate commerce in order to regulate something that is not commerce Congress cannot use its power to regulate interstate commerce in order to regulate intrastate commerce In classic judicial understatement the Supreme Court has said that our understanding of the reach of the commerce clause has evolved over time Indeed it has Since the 1930s the Supreme Court has expanded the power to regulate interstate commerce to include regulating activities that substantially affect interstate commerce That is obviously far beyond by orders of magnitude what the commerce power was intended to mean but that is where things stand today and some say it justifies this health insurance mandate in this bill Using the Constitution or even the Supreme Courts revision of the Constitution as a guide requires more than a good intention fueled by an active imagination The Supreme Court has certainly expanded the category of activitiesget that word activitiesthat Congress may regulate But every one of its cases has involved Congress seeking to regulate just that activities in which people have chosen to engage Even the Supreme Court has never abandoned that category altogether and allowed Congress instead to require that individuals engage in activities in this case by purchasing a particular good or service The Court has never done that Let me mention just three of the Supreme Courts commerce clause cases In its very first case Gibbons v Ogden in 1824 Thomas Gibbons had received a Federal license to operate a steamboat between New Jersey and New York and wanted to compete with Aaron Ogden who had been granted a steamboat monopoly by New York State In Wickard v Filburn Roscoe Filburn used the winter wheat he planted on his Ohio farm to feed his livestock and make bread for his own dinner table In the winter of 1942 he grew more wheat than allowed under the Agricultural Adjustment Act and challenged the resulting fine And in Hodel v Surface Mining Reclamation Association companies challenged a Federal statute regulating surface coal mining These cases have two things in common The Supreme Court upheld Federal authority in each case but each case involved an activity remember the word activityin which individuals chose to engage There would have been no Gibbons v Ogden if Thomas Gibbons had not chosen to operate a steamboat Congress could regulate his activity but could not have required that he engage in it There would have been no Wickard v Filburn if Roscoe Filburn had not chosen to grow wheat Congress could regulate his activity but not have required that he engage in it And there would have been no Hodel case if companies had not chosen to mine coal Congress could regulate their activity but could not have required that they engage in it The key word in the commerce clause is the word regulate and the key word in every Supreme Court case about the commerce clause is the word activity Regulating an activity in which individuals chose to engage is one thing requiring that they engage in that activity is another The Congressional Budget Office examined the 1994 health care reform legislation which also included a mandate to purchase health insurance Here is the CBOs the Congressional Budget Offices conclusion This is August 1994 the Congressional Budget Office A mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action The government has never required people to buy a particular good or service Federal mandates typically apply to people as parties to economic transactions rather than members of society That is pretty important language In other words Congress can regulate commercial activities in which people choose to engage but cannot require that they engage in those commercial activities Just a few months ago as Congress once again is considering a health insurance mandate the Congressional Research Service examined the same issue Here is what the Congressional Research Service concluded This was in July 2009 The CRS concluded Whether such a requirement to have health insurance would be constitutional under the Commerce Clause is perhaps the most challenging question posed by such a proposal as it is a novel issue whether Congress may use this clause to require an individual to purchase a good or service Can Congress use this clause to require an individual to purchase a good or service One thing did change in the legal landscape between 1994 when CBO called the health insurance mandate unprecedented and 2009 when CRS called it novel The Supreme Court twice found that there are limits to what Congress may do in the name of regulating interstate commerce In United States v Lopez the Court rejected a version of the commerce power that would make it hard to posit any activity by an individual that Congress is without power to regulate If there is no difference between regulating and requiring what people do if there is no difference between incentives and mandates if Congress may require that individuals purchase a particular good or service why did we even bother with the Cash for Clunkers Program Why did we bother with TARP or other bailouts We could simply require that Americans buy certain cars or appliances invest in certain companies or deposit their paychecks in certain banks For that matter we could attack the obesity problem by requiring Americans to buy fruits and vegetables and to eat only those Some say that because State governments may require drivers to buy car insurance the Federal Government may require that everyone purchase health insurance That is too simplistic that argument Simply stating that point should be enough to refute it States may do many things that the Federal Government may not and if you do not drive a car you do not have to buy car insurance This legislation would require individuals to have health insurance simply because they exist even if they never see a doctor for the rest of their lives The defenders of this health insurance mandate must know that they are on shaky constitutional ground The bill before us now includes findings which attempt to connect the mandate to the Constitution I assume they are the best arguments that this unprecedented and novel mandate is constitutional Those findings fail in at least four ways First the findings say that the requirement to purchase health insurance will add millions of new consumers to the health insurance market I cannot dispute the observation that requiring more people to purchase health insurance will result in more people having health insurance I think that seems quite selfevident But the question is not the effect of the mandate but the authority for the mandate Liberty requires that the ends cannot justify the means The findings also fail to establish that the insurance mandate is constitutional by failing to offer a single examplea single precedent a single case in which Congress has required individuals to purchase a particular good or service or the courts have upheld such a requirement The cases I described are typical and similar examples are legion Every one involvesevery one of those cases I have citedthe regulation of activity in which individuals choose to engage Requiring that the individual engage in such activity is a difference not in degree but in kind The findings also fail to answer the question by observing that States such as Massachusetts have required that individuals purchase health insurance As I noted regarding the example of car insurance our Federal and State system allows States to do many things that the Federal Government may not That is one of those limits on the Federal Government that is necessary to protect liberty The findings fail to answer the question by mistakenly focusing on whether Congress may regulate the sale of insurance That misses the point in two respects Simply because Congress may regulate the sale of health insurance does not mean that the Congress may require it Simply because Congress may regulate the sale of health insurance does not mean that Congress may regulate the purchase of health insurance This legislation requires you to believe that nonactivity is the same as activity that choosing not to do something is the same as choosing to do it that regulating what individuals do is the same as requiring them to do it That notion makes no common sense and it certainly makes no constitutional sense If Congress can require individuals to spend their own money on a particular good or service simply because Congress thinks it is important then the Constitution means whatever Congress says it means and there are and will be no limits to the Federal Governments power over each and every one of our lives That version of Federal power will be exactly what the Supreme Court in Lopez prohibited namely that there would be no activity by individuals that the Federal Government may not control Neither the power to regulate interstate granted by the Constitution nor the power to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce granted by the Supreme Court go that far They dont go that far The American people agree A national poll conducted last month found that 75 percent of Americans believe that requiring them to purchase health insurance is unconstitutional because Congresss power to regulate commerce does not include telling Americans what they must buy By a margin of more than 7 to 1 Americans believe that elected officials should be more concerned with upholding the Constitution regardless of what might be popular than enacting legislation even if it is not constitutional Some defenders of this legislation such as the House majority leader have said that Congress may require individuals to purchase health insurance because it can pass legislation to promote the general welfare The only thing necessary to dismiss this argument is to read the Constitution Read the Constitution That dismisses this argument Just read it Read the Constitution Article I refers to general welfare as a purpose not as a power It is a purpose that limits rather than expands Congresss power to tax and to spend The requirement that individuals purchase health insurance is not an exercise of either the power to tax or the power to spend and so even the purpose of general welfare is not connected to it at all Needless to say it makes no sense to include in a written Constitution designed to limit Federal Government power an openended catchall provision empowering Congress to do anything it thinks serves the general welfare If Americas Founders wanted to create a Federal Government with that much power they could have written a much shorter Constitution one that simply told Congress to go for it and legislate well That is what they could have done They didnt do that thank goodness The Heritage Foundation has just published an important paper arguing that this health insurance mandate is both unprecedented and unconstitutional It is authored by Professor Randy Barnett the Cormack Waterhouse Professor of Legal Theory at the George Washington Law Center Nathaniel Stewart an attorney with the prestigious law firm of White Case and Todd Gaziano Director of the Center for Judicial and Legal Studies at the Heritage Foundation I ask unanimous consent to have the conclusion portion of the Legal Memorandum published by the Heritage Foundation printed in the Record There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows Conclusion In theory the proposed mandate for individuals to purchase health insurance could be severed from the rest of the 2000 pluspage reform bill The legislations key sponsors however have made it clear that the mandate is an integral indeed essential part of the bill After all the revenues paid by conscripted citizens to the insurance companies are needed to compensate for the increased costs imposed upon these companies and the health care industry by the myriad regulations of this bill The very reason why an unpopular health insurance mandate has been included in these bills shows why if it is held unconstitutional the remainder of the scheme will prove politically and economically disastrous Members need only recall how the Supreme Courts decision in Buckley v Valeo which invalidated caps on campaign spending as unconstitutional while leaving the rest of the scheme intacthas created 30 plus years of incoherent and pernicious regulations of campaign financing and the need for repeated reforms Only this time the public is aligned against a scheme that will require repeated unpopular votes especially to raise taxes to compensate for the absence of the health insurance mandate These political considerations are beyond the scope of this paper and the expertise of its authors But Senators and Representatives need to know that despite what they have been told the health insurance mandate is highly vulnerable to challenge because it is in truth unconstitutional And political considerations aside each legislator owes a duty to uphold the Constitution I also wish to share with my colleagues a letter I received from Dr Michael Adams and attorney Carroll Robinson They are on the faculty of the Barbara Jordan Mickey Leeland School of Public Affairs at Texas Southern University Mr Robinson a former member of the Houston City Council was named by the Democratic Leadership Council in 2000 to its list of 100 to Watch I ask unanimous consent their entire letter which is dated October 25 2009 be printed in the Record following my remarks This is an excerpt from Michael Adams PhD and Carroll G Robinson Esquire from the Barbara Jordan and Mickey Leland School of Public Affairs Texas Southern University Our reading of the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent could not identify any reasonable basis expressed or implied for granting Congress the broad sweeping and unprecedented power that is represented by the individual mandate requirement In fact we could not find any court decision state or federal that said or implied that the Constitution gave Congress the power to mandate citizens buy a particular good or service or be subject to a financial penalty levied by the government for not doing so That is pretty impressive stuff It is certainly possible to achieve the goal of greater health insurance coverage by constitutional means not unconstitutional means I am quite certain however that those means are politically impossible Liberty requires that the Constitution trump politics but in the legislation before us politics trumps the Constitution Another provision in this legislation that is inconsistent with the Constitution is section 9001 which imposes an excise tax on highcost employersponsored insurance plans differently in some States than in others The legislation imposes a tax equal to 40 percent of benefits above a prescribed limit but raises that limit in 17 States to be determined by the Secretaries of the Treasury and Health and Human Services My colleague from Ohio Senator Brown spoke against this provision on policy grounds earlier The Constitution allows Congress to impose excise taxes but requires that they be uniform throughout the United States This is one of those provisions that will be dismissed with pejorative labels such as archaic by those who find it annoying But it is right there in the same Constitution that we have all sworn to uphold We have all sworn that same oath to protect and defend and we are just as bound today to obey it Frankly a good test of our commitment to the Constitution is when we must obey a provision that limits what we want to do The Supreme Court has had relatively few opportunities to interpret and apply the uniformity clause but its cases do provide some basic principles which I think easily apply to the legislation before us today The Court has held for example that a Federal excise tax must be applied with the same force and effect in every place where the subject of it is found The Congress has wide latitude in determining what to tax and may tailor a regional solution to a geographically isolated problem but laws drawn explicitly in terms of State lines will receive heightened scrutiny By the plain terms of the legislation before us insurance plans providing a certain level of benefits in one State will be taxed while the very same plans providing the very same benefits in another will not be taxed We do not yet know what States will be treated differently but we do know according to this bill that 17 of them will That actually makes the constitutional point more clearly by identifying the Statebased discrimination more starkly Congress may decide to tax insurance plans with benefits that exceed a particular limit but the tax must have the same force and effect wherever that subject of the tax is found That is the clear meaning of the constitutional provision and the clear holding of the Supreme Courts precedents Taxing the same insurance plans differently in one State than in another is the opposite of taxing them uniformly throughout the United States I commend to my colleagues the work of Professor Thomas Colby of the George Washington University Law School whose comprehensive work on the uniformity clause was published in volume 91 of the Virginia Law Review I asked the Congressional Research Service to look at this uniformity clause issue Its report confirmed that this differential tax on high cost insurance plans is drawn explicitly along State lines and that a court will more closely scrutinize the reasons for the Statebased distinction It also concluded that Congress has not articulated any justification for singling out certain States for different treatment I have raised this issue over and over throughout the process of developing and considering this legislation I serve on both of the Senate committees that are involved in this process In fact I can say I have served on three not only the HELP Committeethe Health Education Labor and Pensions Committeebut also the Finance Committee as well as the Judiciary Committee that for some reason has some great interest in the Constitution I have never heard any justification for singling out certain States for different tax treatment The attitude seems to be that this is what the majority wants to do so they are going to do it no matter what the Constitution says That may be politically possible but that does not make it constitutionally permissible Other legal analysts and scholars who are examining this health care takeover legislation are raising additional constitutional objections Professor Richard Epstein of the University of Chicago School of Law for example focuses on provisions that restrict insurance providers ability to make their own riskadjusted decisions about coverage and premiums He argues these restrictions amount to a taking of private property without just compensation and in violation of the fifth amendment Others have observed that the legislation requires States to establish health benefit exchanges It does not ask cajole encourage or even bribe them It simply orders State legislatures to pass legislation creating these health benefit exchanges and says if States do not do so the Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish the exchanges for them How thoughtful But as the Supreme Court said in FERC v Mississippi in 1982 This Court never has sanctioned explicitly a federal command to the States to promulgate and enforce laws and regulations The Supreme Court reaffirmed a decade later in New York v United States that the Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers upon Congress the power to regulate individuals not States In that case the Court struck down Federal legislation that would press State officials into administering a Federal program More recently in Printz v United States the Supreme Court stated We have held however that State legislatures are not subject to Federal direction Yet this legislation does what these cases said Congress may not do It commands States to pass laws it regulates States in their capacity as States and it attempts to make States subject to Federal direction Let me return to the principles with which I began Liberty requires limits on government power Those limits come primarily from a written Constitution which delegates enumerated powers to Congress We must be able to identify at least one of those enumerated powers to justify legislation and those powers should not mean whatever we in our delightful wisdom want them to mean Those principles lead me to conclude that Congress does not have the authority to require that individuals purchase health insurance and that Congress cannot tax certain health insurance plans in some States but not in others These and the others I have mentioned are only some of the constitutional issues raised by this legislation Any of these and others I have not mentioned could well be the basis for future litigation challenging this legislation should it become law Writing for the Supreme Court in 1991 Justice Sandra Day OConnor reminded us The Constitution created a Federal Government of limited powers Americas Founders she wrote limited Federal Government power to protect our fundamental liberties Here is the way Justice OConnor put it writing for the Supreme Court in New York v United States in 1992 But the Constitution protects us from our own best intentions It divides power among sovereigns and among branches of government precisely so that we may resist the temptation to concentrate power in one location as an expedient solution to the crisis of the day That is a pretty remarkable statement I could not have said it better myself Those are either principles we must obey or cliches we may ignore If the Constitution means anything anymore if it does what it was created to do by not only empowering but more importantly limiting government power then now is the time to stand on principle rather than to slip on politics I yield the floor Exhibit 1 October 25 2009 Hon Orrin G Hatch US Senator Dear Senator Hatch We support reducing the cost of health insurance and expanding access to quality affordable prevention wellness and health care services for all Americans Despite our support for health care reform that empowers consumers we have serious concerns about the constitutionality of the individual mandate requirement being proposed by Congress At least one scholar has argued that the individual mandate requirement is constitutional because Congress has unlimited authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate the economic activity of individual American citizens no matter how infinitesimal We do not agree with that position In Philadelphia the Framers established a federal government of limited powers If Congress has unlimited power under the Commerce Clause to regulate the economic activity of citizens then the Constitution is no longer and never was a promise that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter We believe that this promise still exists and is not a mirage The Supreme Court said so at least as recently as 2003 It has also been argued that the individual mandate is constitutional because citizens have no fundamental right to be uninsured or to decline insurance These are strawman characterizations intended to distract attention from the real constitutional question Does Congress have the power to mandate citizens buy a specific good or service or be subjected to a financial penalty for not doing so Our reading of the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent could not identify any reasonable basis expressed or implied for granting Congress the broad sweeping and unprecedented power that is represented by the individual mandate requirement In fact we could not find any court decision state or federal that said or implied that the Constitution gave Congress the power to mandate citizens buy a particular good or service or be subject to a financial penalty levied by the government for not doing so There are cases that say Congress can tell consumers what products to buy if they choose to buy but no cases that say Congress can mandate that a citizen must buy a particular good or service or be fined for not doing so The individual mandate requirement directly burdens the fundamental meaning of being an American citizen as embodied in the Ninth Amendment reaching back through the Declaration of Independence to the Magna Carta and its expansion coming forward from the 35ths Clause of Article I of the Constitution and the Courts Dred Scott decision to the Thirteenth Fourteenth Fifteenth Nineteenth TwentyFourth and TwentySixth Amendments as well as through Supreme Court decisions related to these amendments legislation adopted pursuant to them the Bill of Rights and its penumbra The Supreme Court has ruled that freedom of speech expression and association are constitutionally protected Our right to freely move around the country is also constitutionally protected Congress can regulate the size of political donations but has no authority to tell a citizen which political candidate or party they can lawfully contribute to Like political donations how a citizen legally spends their money in the market place is clearly a form of expression and association that requires strict scrutiny or heightened protection Calling the individual mandate a tax raises another constitutional concern Under the mandate American citizens are essentially subject to a financial penalty simply for being a citizen of the United States residing in a state of the Union It is essentially an existence fee a fee for existing Under the Fourteenth Amendment the definition of citizenship does not include any requirement that Americans pay a tax simply because we are citizens In fact the TwentyFourth Amendment and related Supreme Court decisions expressly prohibit financially burdening the rights of citizens to prevent them from exercising a right of citizenship Citizens have a liberty interest in deciding when to buy a good or service and which to buy form the legally available options The Supreme Court has said Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities they might have been more specific They did not presume to have this insight They knew times can blind us to certain truths and laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress As the Constitution endures persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom We believe that reducing the cost of health care insurance and expanding coverage can be achieved without opening the constitutional Pandoras Box of the individual mandate requirement Sincerely Carroll G Robinson Esq Michael O Adams PhD 
S_IA_GRASSLEY,2009-12-17,1981_2009,0268, President I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for 10 minutes President I rise on the issue of jobs and 10 percent unemployment and to tell my fellow Senators what we can do to preserve maybe 25000 jobs in an industry that by the end of the month will be otherwise shut down because Congress is not taking action The main point of my remarks is if we dont extend the biodiesel tax credit by the end of the month these jobs will be lost My point is 23000 jobs will be lost In fact right now on December 17 companies are making plans to shut down these operations by the end of the year Everybody knows our unemployment rate is 10 percent Everybody knows the President has spent a great deal of time over the last 2 or 3 weeks talking about creating jobs and getting us out of the recession But we have to remember that for those without work this is not just a recession it is a depression We all agree we should take whatever action is necessary to jump start our economy and get people back to work President Obama and Vice President Biden have been talking for months about the need to create green jobs Well green jobs purple jobs whatever kind of jobs jobs are jobs I dont object to the creation of green jobs In fact what I am talking about is some of these green jobs President Obama has held three public events in recent days to highlight his concern about the economy and the need to create jobs Yesterday the administration apparently announced billions more in tax credits for renewable energy and energy conservation efforts I will bet when I look at that list I am going to support most of those because I believe a national energy policy involves capturing whatever we can of petroleum and fossil fuels we have available for a short period of time because we are never going to get rid of them in the short term We need conservation and we need renewable and alternative energy Those three things make a comprehensive energy program Obviously if I am for that comprehensive energy program I am for renewable energy and alternative energy It seems as if nearly everyone in fact in the administration is touting the benefits of green jobs and a clean energy economy and I am doing that right now myself It is astonishing though with all this talk about green jobs and clean energy that this Congress right now seems to be heading for the holidays while thousands of green energy workers will receive pink slips and furloughs On December 31 of this year the current biodiesel tax credit will expire The biodiesel tax credit provides a 1pergallon credit for biodiesel made from soybean oil and yellow grease and animal fats The tax credit is essential in maintaining the competitiveness of this cleanburning domestically produced green fuel and the jobs that are connected with it The tax credit exists for a commonsense reason and something we have been using for a long period of time to offset the higher cost of producing biodieselor I could just as well insert the word ethanolcompared to petroleum diesel Without the tax credit petroleum marketers will be unwilling to purchase the more expensive biodiesel and demand will vanish From this standpoint of the tax credit I hope everybody remembers that whether it is wind ethanol solar biodiesel biomass or geothermal it takes tax credits to get these programs off the ground Right now wind energy is a big industry in my State not only from the production standpoint but from the standpoint of manufacturing of components because in 1992 I got a wind energy tax credit passed otherwise we would not have wind energy and everybody touts wind energy today It is a little bit like the very infant biodiesel industry we have One might not think biofuels are an infant industry because ethanol has been around for 30 years but biodiesel is about where ethanol was 30 years ago So we want to help move this industry along so eventually it can stand on its own legs That is the motive behind all these tax credits to get an infant industry started and then they stand on their own In 2008 getting back to the jobs in this industry biodiesel supported 51000 green jobs Because of the downturn in the economy and the credit crisis the biodiesel industry has already shed 29000 green jobs So now what about the rest of those jobs That is what my remarks are all about and that is what getting the tax credit renewed before the end of the year is all about Because the industry is currently operating at just around 15 percent of capacity Without an extension of the tax credit all US biodiesel production will grind to a halt Plants will be shuttered and workers will be let go No one should be surprised by the upcoming expiration of this tax credit It was extended most recently in October 2008 So we have known for 14 months hence nobody should be surprised that it would need to be extended by the end of this year The Senate has been in session nearly continuously for months Earlier this year Senator Cantwell and I introduced a bill to extend the tax credit for 5 years and change it to a production tax credit There is no excuse for inaction on this credit The Democratic leadership is content to leave without doing the necessary work on extenders believing they can extend the tax provisions retroactively sometime early next year Retroactivity does work a lot of times on tax extenders that are not extended at the end of the year and extended to be made retroactive But retroactivity in the case of the biodiesel market doesnt help bring it from grinding to a halt on January 1 2010 because without the incentive the biodiesel will cost much more than petroleum diesel While the House and Senate dither thousands will lose their jobs but demand for dirty imported petroleum diesel however will continue Investments in the domestic renewable fuels industry will lose value and possibly disappearquite to the contrary of what I said in my remarks of yesterday the President announcing various tax credits So this one has been on the books All it has to be is reauthorized It is too bad that among all the talk of green jobs and the clean energy economy Congress is unable to pass a simple extension of an existing tax credit Once again the actions of the majority do not match their words For all the talk they will have failed all those in the biodiesel industry working today to reduce our dependence upon foreign oil if we leave without extending this critical tax credit before the end of the year I yield the floor

fighting for our coal reserves and the importance of that And I usually bring another poster of miners who lost their jobs during the last cycle 1200 miners in one mine The State of Ohio lost 35000 coal miner jobs That is just a fraction of what we will see in this country if we roll back the carbon emissions and if they could prove it but they cant And that is what Administrator Jackson just said I think what is important Mr Barton was your focus on science and your focus on data points and what we should be able to do in the Chamber in a bipartisan manner is to agree on the data points We should be able to agree on what the science is and thats in question And for many of us it has been in question for a long time Were joined by John Linder whos been following this as long as anyone else has and part of his search has been because the scientists would not give the data They would never tell us whats the base by which theyre making this extrapolation And so Im glad that you highlighted the scientific method that I didnt get on the chart but I brought down here Its very simple I taught high school Youre an engineer I went to an engineering school This is irrefutable This is how science is done You ask questions You do background research Background research in this debate would be to get the temperatures Were already questioning the background research one based upon the request from the Freedom of Information Act and of course now our friends at the IPCC are saying We dont have them The dog ate the homework It is amazing Scientists are really some of the most respected professionals But theyre respected because of this this process which should be objective You should be able to follow it You should be able to construct a hypothesis The hypothesis is an educated guess That is all it is Its not truth Its a guess based upon the data points And then you arethen youre to test it And then you analyze the result and then draw your conclusions Based upon the scientific method you can categorically say right now that those who say the science that solves are in error The science does not solve That is why all of this political activity is going on right now That is why now the EPA administrator is saying Were going to do endangerment findings They want to do it before we are able to educate the public that the science is not solid And they are not providing us with the data points theyre not complying with Freedom of Information Act requests And so this process is skewed So when they tested it they found out that the results didnt match their educated guess And what did they do These scientists are politicians They went intowe call it in the military they went and holed up They lowered the turrets they got under ground Dont ask questions And here are some of the emails in essence to prove that Heres the first one The fact is that we cant account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we cant As of 2 months ago we cant account for the lack of warming Theres two things here First of all they say we cant account for the lack of warming So their background research he is already trying to skew the research And he has an emotional response Its a shame Im saddened Scientists shouldnt be emotionally attached to the data This is the data Lets test it What we would encourage our friends on the other side to say is in a bipartisan manner lets get the facts on the table and lets get the scientists to look at the facts The facts are being hidden That is sad One is they dont have the facts two is hes emotionally distraught because his hypotheses cannot be proven Heres another one to the ranking member I cant see either of these papers being in the next International Panel on Climate Change report Kevin and I will keep them out somehoweven if we have to redefine what the peerreview literature is Heres another process on the scientific message Analyze the results Draw conclusions They have got sometheyve done some analysis that doesnt support it So are they going to add that in a scientific objective fashion say This is what we believe but there are some who disagreethey say that the facts dont speak for the hypotheses No These scientists say Were going to bury it Were going to hide it We dont want the public to know Can you imagine scientists doing that Again the scientific community is one of the most respected communities because they go by the scientific method Here they admit that theyre going to keep the analyses out of the reporttwo analyses that contradict what they want their hypothesis to be And theres the followup Are they receiving taxpayer dollars to promote this theory through the IPCC which is the UN International Panel on Climate Change or Virginiaedu and you could speculate that there are DOE grants EPA money going And another thing these scientists are for hire Theyre for hire I believe that those who seek taxpayer dollarswe know here that agencies and programs never go away If thats why theyre not providing the data thats why theyre hiding the fact of the last decadecan you imagine us in this environment of trying to get control of the deficit and the debt and were spending billions of dollars to scientists who are not using the scientific method They want to keep their jobs so theyre continuing to promote and deceive the public I dont know I would say its pretty damaging to their name to the community and also to the taxpayers Now if I may I have one more that Id like to share And there are tons I mean these are just a small sampling The ones I picked out I kind of wanted to address the scientific method Again as an engineer give us the facts give us the data test the data prove if its right or wrong If its wrong get an analysis and then maybe try again Retest it Lets retest the data point Here is another one Ive just completed Mikes Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years ie from 1981 onwards 20 years for Keith to hide the decline So now not only are they not providing the data they are keeping the analysis from being reported in the IPCC report and they are jimmying the numbers They are actually using tricks These are scientists Now we are politicians I think people would have some skepticism We dont claim to beyou claim to be an engineer I went to engineering school I understand it but if you were building a bridge or if you were designing a building and you jimmied the numbers on the tensile strength of the steel you would be in real trouble because the design would be faulty and the building would collapse Their design Administrator Jacksons design to remake the United States is on faulty data It is on data that has been jimmied And this house of cards will collapse and it will be jobs in the wake on faulty data Now bring us real data Go through the scientific method Test it but dont hide it Dont trick us Dont deceive us Dont discourage your profession of scientists by staying on the public dole to receive taxpayer money to continue to promote a fraud a fraud on the American public So thats why I real appreciate Congressman Barton that youve taken this time to help address this Theres a lot of education And this education has to go on now because they are going to be making decisions in Copenhagen They are going to try to bind us to stuff on faulty data The International Panel on Climate Change they are the UN designees to continue to provide the information to the folks who attend the conference upon which they make the decisions

certainly respect that the Senator from Montana worked very hard to have a bipartisan initiative here but this bill we are dealing with has no bipartisanship to it at all Was this not written in camera behind closed doors for 8 weeks by the majority leader Was there a Republican in that room at any time And we have now been on it for what 8 days or something while they wrote it for 8 weeks And furthermore is there not rumored to be floating around this Congress somewhere in some room againthat we have not been invited toa major rewrite of this bill called the managers amendment which supposedly is going to expand coverage to people under Medicare to 55 years of age with Medicare already being bankrupt and already cannot afford the people they have on Medicare It is going to expand it We have not seen it Yet this is going to change this bill fundamentally and change health care fundamentally Is that bipartisan I ask the Senator from Wyoming if that is the case Was this bill written in a bipartisan manner Were any Republicans in the room Did it go through a committee process Was it amended Did it not take 8 weeks to write it and it has now been on the floor for 8 days and all of our amendments are being pushed to the side And are we not hearing about a massivea massiverewrite of this bill that is going to appear deus ex machina from the majority leaders office and fundamentally change the way health care is delivered in this country Is that going to be bipartisan The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Bennet The Senator from New Hampshire On that last point it does seem there is a slowdown occurring on amendments As I understand it we have four or five very substantive amendments dealing with taxes dealing with employer mandates that we are ready to go to and we are ready to vote on is that not correct I hope at some point today maybe we should propound a unanimous consent setting those four items up for votes on Saturday and Sunday President I would ask is the Senator from North Dakota recognized under an order of a colloquy at this point President I ask unanimous consent that we have 20 minutes equally divided between myself and the Senator from North Dakota at this time I see the Senator from Connecticut obviously wishes to speak also Do we have time remaining on our side President I am privileged to join the Senator from South Dakota the chairman of the Budget Committee on this initiative We have worked on it for a while and we have come to a position of having a piece of legislation that accomplishes the goal as outlined by the Senator from North Dakota That is good news The outpouring of support in the Senateover 31 cosponsors in just a brief period of timeis a sign that there is a willingness to move in a bipartisan way That is good news Right now for this country after the possibility of a terrorist getting a weapon of mass destruction and using it against us in the United States the single biggest threat we have as a nation is the fact that we are on course toward fiscal insolvency You cannot get around it If we continue on the present course this Nation goes bankrupt We are already seeing the early signs of it The early signs are devastating enough We are seeing some of the nations who lend to usand remember we are a debtor nation now of massive proportions saying Hold on you folks are not being responsible especially about your outyear debt Two days ago we saw one of the rating agencies Moodys say England and the United States now are going to be put into a special category relative to the rest of the industrialized world because their fiscal situation is in such risk and they are not managing their fiscal house correctly We know as the Senator from North Dakota has outlined so correctly that within 10 yearsmaybe soonerwe are going to get to a point where our debt has gotten so large we simply cannot pay it or if we have to pay it we are going to have to do some extraordinary things to do that such as inflating the currency or raising taxes to a level where we reduce productivity and the opportunity for jobs It is akin to a dog chasing its tail when you get your debt to a certain level When you have spent so much more than you have taken in and you have promised so much more than you can afford to pay and your debt gets to such a level as a nation you only have two choices You inflate the currency and destroy the quality of peoples lives destroying the value of their savings and you put in an inflation economy which is one of the worst things that can ever happen to a country or you have to radically increase your tax burden to levels that are simply going to choke off the capacity of the Nation to create prosperity because people will not be able to be productive You will start to lose tax revenues as a result of that This is not a theoretical case This is no longer something that is over the horizon This problem is directly in front of us We are hearing it from the people who lend us money from the rating agencies and we know it from intuitive common sense Most Americans know this is an extraordinary problem We talked about this for a long time and we worked on it for a long time Yes regular order should take care of this but we know it will not because we have seen what happens When you put an idea on the table to deal with major entitlement programs that affect so many people in such a personal way immediately those ideas are attacked and savaged misrepresented exploited exaggerated and hyperbolized by the interest groups that populate this city and other parts of the country for the purpose of making their political agenda move forward or their moneyraising formula move forward When substantive good ideas have been put on the table to try to correct this fiscal imbalance by dealing with questions of Social Security and Medicare or tax policy we get clobbered on the policy side We came to the conclusion from the right and the left that it is equally outrageous and equally destructive of constructive public policy We came to the conclusion that the only way you can do this is to create a process that drives the policy rather than put the policy on the table first saying here is the policy and everybody jumps on it and kicks it and screams at it and so it never even gets to the starting line We decided lets get to a process that leads to policy and leads to an absolute vote The theory is basically threefold One the process has to be absolutely fair and bipartisan Nobody can feel they are being gamed The American people will not allow major policy to occur in these areas unless they are comfortable the policy is bipartisan and fair So this process we have set up is a bipartisan affair There will be 18 people We decided to go with people who actually have a responsibility for making decisions and understand the issues intimately 16 from the Congress as was mentioned8 Republicans and 8 Democratsand the 2 from the administration with a supermajority to meet to report and there will be cochairmen from each party That gives us the bipartisan nature The second part that is critical to the exercise is that it be real and that it not end up being a game We have seen so many commissions end up being just commissions They put their report out and it ends up on a shelf somewhere Something has to happen What happens is when this Commission reports with a supermajority and comes to Congress by supermajority it must be voted up or down So there is an absolute right to a vote and the vote occurs on the policies proposed That is critical It is much along the lines of what we did for base closures for many of the same reasons You couldnt close bases politically so we did it by fast track approval Third there will be no amendments Why Amendments allow Members to hide in the corners It is that simple Somebody throws an amendment upeven if it is well intentionedand people vote for the amendment and then say it didnt pass or I will not vote for the final product You have to have a policy put forward and it will either attract a bipartisan supermajority and be a fair policy or it is not If it doesnt attract a bipartisan supermajority clearly it wasnt well thought out That is the process we have come to The amount of sponsors we have reflects the fact that it is viable and that it is bipartisan We have 12 Democratic sponsors already and 19 Republicans What else around here has that with serious legislation This is it I congratulate the Senator from North Dakota for his efforts I am hopeful we can get a vote on it Then I hope it can pass and I am hopeful we can get White House support and House support to do this We are running out of time If we dont accomplish this fairly soon the outcome is very simple We will pass on to our children less opportunity a lower standard of living and a weaker Nation than we received from our parents No generation in American history has done that But that is what we are going to do if we dont take action That is exactly what is going to happen How can one generation do that to another In American history that has never happened This is an opportunity to avoid having that occur or at least help avoid it I hope it will move forward I reserve the remainder of my time 
S_KS_BROWNBACK,2009-12-11,1996_2009,0152, President I am delighted to follow my colleague from Utah I am pleased he has raised these constitutional issues which I think are significant to this bill The idea that we could have a constitutional mandate to buy health insurance to me is highly questionable under our rights under the role of the Federal Government and under the Constitution Senator Hatch has been on the Judiciary Committee for many years and he understands these issues very well We are now on our sixth iteration of the health care reform bill This one talks about expanding Medicare basically as one of the key components of solving the problem Here is a quote from the Mayo Clinic I found and others have also been cited I found this interesting succinct and accurate Any plan to expand Medicare which is the Governments largest public plan beyond its current scope does not solve the Nations health care crisis but compounds it It is also clear that an expansion of the price control of the Medicare payment system will not control overall Medicare spending or curb costs This scenario follows the typical pattern for price control reduced access compromised quality and increasing costs anyway We need to address these problems not perpetuate them through health reform legislation That was the Mayo Clinic It is clearly not the way to go to solve the crisis or the problems It probably hastens the day Medicare goes bankrupt which is set to happen in 2017 7 years away I want to talk about the possibility that this health care bill puts this very early piece of economic recovery that we are having at risk The latest reports on unemployment provide some hope that our battered economy may be showing some tentative signs of economic recovery as the job loss continues to slow Most of this is based off of monetary policy We are seeing some of this taking place Consumer confidence is still low Unemployment hovers at 10 percent and over 7 million jobs were lost since the beginning of the recession It should be clear that any potential recovery is incredibly fragile That being the case Congress and the administration should focus like a laser beam on policies that encourage economic growth and put Americans back to work That seems to be obvious Instead though the administration and the Democraticcontrolled Congress have taken up crucial months with a proposed revamping of our entire health care system that will cost nearly 25 trillion over the next 10 years to be paid for by new taxes and employer mandates and it will impose a grave risk to a sustained rebound of our Nations economy This hurts our economic recovery Not only that but the Democratic health care bill includes some positively perverse incentives that would discourage hiring work saving and even marriage Again it would discourage hiring work savings and marriage Higher taxes more employer mandates and disincentives to job creation productivity and family formation are hardly the prescription for the growth our economy so desperately needs right now Both the House and the Senate bills would for instance increase the already existing penalty on work faced by many lowincome families who receive tax and inkind benefits from government welfare programs We already heard this Health insurance subsidies in the legislation for individuals and families in poverty would tack on an additional 12 to 20 percent to marginal tax rates which already approach 40 to 50 percent for families receiving a variety of benefits for those with low incomes This would result in marginal tax rates of 50 to 60 percent for most affected families If working more hours or obtaining better paying jobs results in more than half of those additional earnings being taken away as a result of taxes or a reduction in benefitsif you are a lowincome individual you are working more you are getting more money coming in but your benefits from the government are reduced So if you are taking 50 to 60 percent away in a reduction of benefits or in taxes the incentive to work harder or to invest in an education is greatly reduced That is obvious on its face Yet it is in this bill This is not the only work disincentive in the bill It is common for teenagers and college students to obtain jobs so they can have some spending money on their own or to help with their educational expenses The Senate bill penalizes the families of these younger workers by including their wages in benefit eligibility calculations For many lowtomoderate income families the inclusion of their wages could mean a significant increase in their cost of health insurance or even in them losing thousands of dollars of health insurance subsidies altogether That is in the bill And more harmful to the economy potentially are the incentives directed at employers Both the House and Senate bills include temporary subsidies to small businesses to encourage them to offer employersponsored health insurance As the number of employees increase or as salaries increase the amount of the credit provided to the business decreases The structure of this subsidy not only discourages employers from hiring new employees but it also discourages them from increasing employees salaries We dont want those sorts of disincentives in any bill Ironically the incentives in the bill would even work to encourage employers to drop health insurance coverage for individual employees or eliminate insurance coverage altogether The Senate bill would cap employee contributions to insurance premiums at 98 percent of their income If an employer offered a policy that required employees to pay more than this the employee would be eligible to purchase insurance through the new health care exchanges The employer would have to pay a fine Since in many cases that fine is considerably less than the additional insurance costs the employer would incur if they retained coverage many businesses concerned about the bottom line would be enticed by the bill to stop providing any health insurance coverage So they are actually enticed here to drop health insurance coverage another thing we dont want to see happen Furthermore employers who offer flexible spending accounts or FSAs will be encouraged to stop providing these taxfree medical spending accounts for their employees Under the Senate Democrats bill FSA contributions will be included in the total cost of employees health insurance benefits for the purpose of calculating the proposed tax on highcost health plansthe socalled Cadillac health care plans Adding an FSA contribution could push the total cost of health benefits above the highcost threshold for many workers which will result in the employer being liable for a portion of the 40 percent highcost plans tax As more and more plans become subject to the highcost plans tax it will be in the employers best interest to eliminate FSA offerings altogether That is another disincentive we dont want to see happening The proposed legislation would also create new marriage penalties across the income spectrum We have been working for some years to do away with the marriage penalty Marriage is a good and solid institution that helps so much in this Nation Yet it puts in a marriage penalty penalizes people for getting married it is built into this legislation These penalties can be so large that in some cases couples would have to forgo marriage in order to avoid thousands of dollars in new taxes The penalties are significant Low and moderateincome families often have limited savings as well Given the already significant marriage penalties in lowincome benefit programs it seems ironic that the government would create yet another program that penalizes lowincome individuals for getting married Currently if they are on public assistance and they get married their combined incomes often move a couple out of the support they receive for their families whether it is health support housing or food support By getting married they often lose their benefits Instead of taking them away we ought to be helping them form solid families That sort of disincentive is built into this health insurance plan as well where you actually put in disincentives for lowincome couples to get married In other words to be able to get the health insurance subsidy they may have to forgo marriage That is not the sort of incentive we want in the system and in the bill We are trying to take it away in the welfare programs but to add another piece to low and moderateincome couples is the wrong way for us to go That the Democratic health care legislation would set the United States on a path to a singlepayer governmentrun health insurance system of the sort found in Europe and Canada is bad enough but even more troubling is the fact that these proposals would create a series of perverse incentives ultimately harmful to workers businesses and the entire economy The Senate must reject this poorly conceived ruinously expensive scheme and get back to the business of helping our economy recover I have talked to many people across the United States and particularly in Kansas many people who are deeply concerned about this economy and the perverse things coming out of Washington While they might start considering investing in their small business putting some income or something out to be able to grow and create jobs people are holding back and saying I dont know how many more taxes you will put on us or what the health insurance plan will look like I dont know what cap and trade will do on raising energy costs They are holding back These perverse economic signals and the discussion of them in Washington is perversely affecting the economy It is hurting the economic recovery If you put these pieces into place statutorily you are hurting savings hurting hiring hurting marriage formation and you will further hurt an already very tentative recovery from taking place This is a bad medicine for the economy The idea that you would expand Medicare to take care of that is a terrible idea You will be hurting a program that already is not financially solvent in the long term and is looking at something like 30 trillion of unfunded obligations already on its books That alone if you expand it back to age 55 plus the provider communitythe American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association are opposed to this expansion of Medicare They dont get full reimbursement of costs right now With the talk about bringing it back to age 55 you will be sweeping a large number of people into Medicare so you are sweeping in a lot of people who are already in private insurance plans When they are pulled out of private insurance which pays at the full rate to the provider community you are taking those resources away from the provider community from doctors and hospitals That is why you are seeing the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association come out against this proposal on Medicare expansion How on Earth would it ever be paid for when the program is already not on a stable financial track The Federation of American Hospitals stated this The FAH is strongly opposed to this proposal A Medicare buyin would involve Medicare rates would be controlled by CMS and would crowd out older workers with private coverage and may choose early retirement as a result Such a policy will further negatively impact hospitals In my rural State in particular it would have a huge negative impact on a number of the hospitals in my State Mr President I yield the floor

Day for pharmaceutical drugs the clock strikes 6 and the pharmaceutical industry wins They have been doing it for 10 years We just repeat the day over and over again My hope is that we will not have to repeat it today My hope is that after a lot of work on a bipartisan piece of legislation the American people will have sufficient support on the floor of the Senate to say it is not fair for us to be paying double triple and 10 times the cost of prescription drugs that others in the world are paying I wonder if we might be able to yield some time to the Senator from Iowa 5 minutes unless the Senator from Arizona wishes to conclude President I yield myself such time as I may consume under the hour I control We are going to have people trotting onto the floor of the Senate this afternoonand some have this morningtalking about this issue of prescription drug reimportation and saying there are safety problems with itsafety problems I wish to talk about one small piece of health care reform without which you cant call it health care reform because at least with respect to the issue of pricing of prescription drugs there will be no reform unless my amendment is passed My amendment is bipartisan It includes support from Senator Snowe Senator MCCain Senator Grassley on that side and many Democratic Senators as well and it says Lets put the brakes on these unbelievable increases in the price of prescription drugs a 9percent increase this year alone in brandname prescription drugs Why is this an important issue How about lets talk about the price of Nexiumthe price of Nexium You buy it if you need it 424 for an equivalent quantity in the United States If you want to buy it elsewhere not 424 you pay 37 in Germany 36 in Spain 41 in Great Britain We are charged the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs We are going to have a lot of people come out and say Well there will be safety problems if we reimport FDAapproved drugs from other countriesabsolute rubbish Here is Dr Rost a former vice president for marketing for Pfizer Corporation and this is what he said During my time I was responsible for a region in northern Europe I never oncenot onceheard the drug industry regulatory agencies the government or anyone else saying that this practice was unsafe Personally I think it is outright derogatory to claim that Americans would not be able to handle reimportation of drugs when the rest of the educated world can do it They have been doing this in Europe for 20 years reimporting lower priced prescription drugs from other countries and they do it safely Our consumers pay the highest prices in the world because there is no competition for prescription drugs When a drug is sold for a fraction of the price elsewhereonetenth the price for Nexium in Germany and Great Britainthe American people cant access it Even though it is made in the same plant the same pill put in the same bottle the American people are told It is offlimits to you Dr Rost also said this Right now drug companies are testifying that imported drugs are unsafe Nothing could be further from the truth This from a former executive of Pfizer Corporation When the pharmaceutical industry goes around the Hill today and tells you that importing medicine is going to be unsafeand by the way our bill only allows the importation from Australia New Zealand Japan and the European countries where they have an identical chain of custody and where we require pedigree and we require batch lots that will make the entire drug supply much safer including the domestic drug supplywhen the pharmaceutical industry goes around the Hill today saying If you vote for the DorganSnoweMCCain et al amendment you are voting for less safety ask the pharmaceutical industry this What about the fact that you get 40 percent of your active ingredients for drugs from India and China and from places in India and China in many circumstances that have never been investigated or inspected by anyone Answer that and then tell us that reimporting FDAapproved prescription drugs from other countries is unsafe What a bunch of rubbish My understanding is sometime yesterdaymaybe late last night somebody made a deal I dont know what the deal is but I guess the deal is to say we are going to have this amendmentit has been 7 days since we started debating this amendmentwe are going to have this amendment vote and then we are going to have another vote on another amendment that nullifies it It is the amendment I call I stand up for the American people paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs If you want to support that amendment go right ahead What you are doing is nullifying any ability of the American people to have the freedom to access lower priced drugs where they are sold elsewhere in the world I am talking about FDAapproved drugs made in FDAapproved plants It doesnt matter what the fancy wrapping and the bright ribbons are on this package This package to nullify what we are trying to do is a package that comes directly from the pharmaceutical industry Why To protect their interests This year they will sell 290 billion worth of drugs 80 percent brandname prescription drugs On brandname drugs the price increased 9 percent this year and on generic drugs it fell by 9 percent Now I understand why they want to protect those interests Here are two pill bottles both contain Lipitor both made in a plant in Ireland by an American corporation This sent to Canada this sent to the United States The American consumer gets the same pill made in the same bottle made in the same plant by the same company The American consumer also gets the privilege of paying nearly triple the price and cant do a thing about it because this Congress vote after vote after vote has said We stand with the pharmaceutical industry and against competition and against freedom for the American worker If I sound a bit sick and tired of it I am We have been going after this for 8 to 10 years to give the American people the freedom to access the identical FDAapproved drugs for a fraction of the price where they are sold everywhere else in the world and we are told again and again and again there is this phony excuse about safety completely phony I will have more to say about it later but I did want to say we are going to see a lot of people trotting out here with such a shopworn tired pathetic argument to try to keep things as they are and try to keep saying to the American people You pay the highest prices in the world for brandname drugs and that is OK That is the way we are going to leave it We will call it health care reform and at the end of the day that is what you end up with The highest prices in the world a 9percent increase just this year alone Over the next 10 years that 9percent increase just this year nets the pharmaceutical industry 220 billion but that is OK That is the way you are going to end up American consumer because we dont want to give you the freedom to access those lower priced drugs where they are sold for a fraction of the price One final point I have mentioned often an old codger who sat on a straw bale at a farm once where I had a meeting and he said I am 80 years old Every 3 months we have to drive to Canada across the border because my wife has been fighting breast cancer Why do we drive to Canada To buy Tamoxifen Why do we have to go there to buy it We paidI think he said onetenth the price in Canada We couldnt have afforded it otherwise Is that what we want the American people to have to do Most people cant drive across the border someplace Why not establish a system like they have had in Europe for 20 years to allow the American people the freedom to access reasonably priced drugs FDAapproved drugs So this is a day in which we will vote on my amendment and then we will vote on an amendment that nullifies it and we will see whether enough of a deal has been made so the fix is in So once again the American people end this day having to pay the highest prices in the world Pay pay pay pay soak the American consumer keep doing it That has been the message here for 10 years A group of us Republicans and Democrats 30 who have cosponsored this legislation have said you know what We are sick and tired of it Give the American people the freedom If this is a global economy how about a global economy for real people How about let them have the advantages of a global economy Once again I will have a lot more to say this afternoon It is apparently a day for dealmaking and we will see who made what deals but we are going to have votes I know one thing I know the pharmaceutical industry has a lot of clout I know that I hope the American people have the ability to expect some clout on their behalf in the Chamber of the Senate this afternoon I yield the floor and I make a point of order that a quorum is not present President I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded President my understanding is there is a desire by some to have a quorum call in which the quorum call time is charged against all sides My understanding is there are I think 5 hours allocated with respect to today 1 hour for the Baucus amendment 1 hour for the Crapo amendment and 3 hours distributed as follows 1 hour for me 1 more Mr Lautenberg and 1 hour for the Republican leader on the prescription drug reimportation am I correct So I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be allocated against the 4 hours and not against the hour I control President my understanding is I will put in a quorum call the time is equally divided apparently between the sides in a circumstance where the other side has 3 hours and our side has 2 hours and especially on the subject I have just discussed the other side has 2 hours and I have 1 hour I will put us into a quorum call and I guess it will be equally divided between the two sides I suggest the absence of a quorum The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Carper Is there objection Without objection it is so ordered The clerk will call the roll The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll I would say to the Senator from Alaska these prescription drugs would be able to be reimported from Australia New Zealand Japan and the European countries that have identical chains of custody to our chain of custody so that there is safety It is also the case that we are in politics so the floor of the Senate is the place of a lot of tall tales I understand that I have been in politics for a long time I know my colleague from Arizona wishes to engage in a brief colloquy on this point The amendment we are offering a bipartisan amendment dealing with the price of prescription drugs is a very important amendment We are going to get our vote on that but then there is also going to be a vote on a poison pill amendment that nullifies it It says if you pass the second amendment it means nothing happens and prescription drug prices keep going through the roof I wish to say quickly there have been very few bipartisan amendments on the floor of the Senate during this health care debate That is regrettable This in fact is bipartisan A wide range of 30 Senators including Republicans John MCCain Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe and so on support this effort and the effort is simple trying to put the brakes on prescription drug prices by giving the American people freedom and the ability to find competition among drug prices where they are sold in other parts of the world for a fraction of what we are charged as American consumers We have been working on this for 10 yearsmyself the Senator from Arizona and others He knows because he was chairman of the Commerce Committee We held hearings on this in the committee The fact is we have gotten votes on it before In each case the pharmaceutical industry which has a lot of muscle around here prevailed on those votes with an amendment that is a poison pill amendment saying somebody has to certify with respect to no additional safety risk and so on These safety issues are completely bogus absolutely bogus They have done in Europe for 20 years what we are proposing to do in this country parallel trading between countries What we are trying to do is save the American people 100 billion in the next 10 years because we are charged the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and there is no justification for it I want to show the Senator from Arizona one chart This is representative If you happen to take Nexium for the same quantity you pay 424 in the United States if you were in Spain you would pay 36 France 67 Great Britain 41 Germany 37 Why is it the American consumer has the privilege of paying 10 times the cost for exactly the same drug put in the same bottle made by the same company in the same plant Justify that The President was a cosponsor of this legislation when he served last year I do want to say as well the American consumer gets to pay 10 times the cost for Nexium Nexium is for acid reflux probably a condition that will exist with some after this vote because my understanding is after 7 days on the floor of the Senate there is now an arrangement by which the pharmaceutical industry will probably have sufficient votes to beat us once again which means the American people lose I also want to make this point Anyone who stands up and cites safety and reads the stuff that has come out of a copying machine for 10 years understand this Dr Peter Rost former vice president of marketing for Pfizer formerly worked in Europe on the parallel trading system said The biggest argument against reimportation is safety What everyone has conveniently forgotten to tell you is that in Europe reimportation of drugs has been in place for 20 years It is an insult to the American people to say You can make this work in Europe for the benefit of consumers to get lower prices but Americans dont have the capability to make this happen dont have the capability to manage it That is absurd This safety issue is unbelievably bogus President I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Iowa The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Kaufman The Senator from Iowa President I ask the Senator to withhold his request for a quorum President back in the mid1800s when Lincoln and Douglas were having their famous debates at one point Lincoln was exasperated because he could not get Douglas to understand something he was saying He said to Douglas Listen how many legs does a horse have Douglas said Four of course Lincoln said If you call the tail a leg how many legs would he have Douglas said Five Lincoln said There is where you are wrong Simply calling a tail a leg doesnt make it a leg at all Yes that is exactly what my colleagues have done suggesting the amendment we are offering is for untested unregulated drugs It is not true The only drugs we are talking about are FDAapproved drugs that are made at an FDAinspected plant part of a chain of custody equal to the US chain of custody It is simply not true that we are talking about untested unregulated drugs That is not true Simply saying that doesnt make it true Here is why we are on the floor of the Senate We are reforming health care That is what the bill is Part of health care is prescription drugs A lot of people take prescription drugs to keep them out of a hospital bed It manages their disease Prescription drugs are very important Here is what happened to the prices year after year As you can see on this chart the rate of inflation is in yellow and the prescription drug prices are in red This year alone it is up 9 percent at a time when inflation is below zero Well why do we want to be able to access the same FDAapproved drug where it is sold elsewhere at a fraction of the price Because the American people will pay in the next decadeif we dont pass this legislation100 billion in excess prescription drug prices If you need to take Nexium for acid refluxmaybe after this vote we will all need it But if you are going to buy Nexium it costs 424 for an equivalent quantity in the United States You can buy it for 41 in the UK 36 in Spainbut it is 424 here Sound fair Not to me Lipitor is the most popular cholesterollowering drug in the world It is 125 in the United States for an equivalent quantity You get the same thing for 40 in the UK or onethird of the price It is 32 in Spain onefourth the price It is 33 in Canada The American people get to pay triple or quadruple the price By the way it comes in these bottles I ask unanimous consent to use the bottles They both contained Lipitor that is made in Ireland by an American corporation They have different colored labels but they are made in the same plant FDA approved and they are sent to different placesthis one to Canada and this one to the United States But we have the privilege of paying triple the price Sound fair Not to me it doesnt Here is a sample Boniva for osteoporosis is up 18 percent this year Singulair for asthma is up 12 percent Enbrel for arthritis is up 12 percent Here is Plavixthe list goes on The question is Is there something we ought to do about this or should we say lets pass health care reform and ignore what is happening to the price of prescription drugs This amendment I offered along with Senators MCCain and Grassley and other colleagues on this side30 cosponsorsis all about freedom for the American people If this is a global economy how about giving the American people the freedom to access identical prescription drugs which we know are identical because we require safety if it doesnt even exist in our own supply Those who talk about safety I remind them 40 percent of the active ingredients in prescription drugs of the United States come from India and Chinafrom places that have never been inspected The Wall Street Journal did terrific expose about this There were over 60 people who died from Heparin in this country It was contaminated Here is where they were making it This picture was in the investigation Here is a rusty old pot being stirred with a limb from a tree Those are active ingredients for American drugs This guy is working with pig intestinesguts from a hog This old man here with a wooden stickit looks unsanitary doesnt it That is the source of Heparin These are the photographs by the Wall Street Journal investigative reporter They are telling us FDAapproved drugs coming from other countries with a chain of custody identical to ours would pose some sort of threat Are you kidding You can make that charge without laughing out loud Lets talk about the existing drug supply for a moment This is a young man named Tim Fagan He was a victim of counterfeit domestic drugs in this countrynot imported FDAapproved drugs Do you know where this guys drug came from Here is the report done on that It is made by Amgen It went through all these places It ended up at a place called Playpen which is a south Florida strip clubin a cooler in the back room of a south Florida strip club At one point it was stored in car trunks Finally it was prescribed and administered to this young man named Tim Fagan He survived but he was getting medicine with one twentieth the necessary strength for a serious disease that his doctor intended for him Dont talk to me about the issue of prescription drug safety We are talking about safety that doesnt now exist in the domestic drug supply but safety standards are included in this amendment Every drug should have a pedigree to track where it came from and in every respect between manufacture and consumption There ought to be batch lots and tracers for every drug There ought to be pedigree for the domestic drug supply as well I wish to quote a former vice president of Pfizer Corporation a prescription drug manufacturer Dr Peter Rost Right now drug companies are testifying that imported drugs are unsafe Nothing could be further from the truth This is from a vice president of one of the major drug companies nothing can be further from the truth He was fired to be sure You cant say that if you are working for a drug company Their business is to try to keep the pricing strategy the way it is I might say I dont have a beef with the drug industry I have a beef with their pricing policy that says we will sell the same drug everywhere in the world at a fraction of the price we charge the American consumer How do you make that stick By a sweetheart deal in law that says the American consumer cannot import the drug The Spanish can import drugs from Germany The French can import drugs from Italy But the American consumer is told you dont have the freedom to shop for that same FDAapproved drugapproved because the place where it is produced is inspected by the FDA in a country with an identical chain of custody but the US consumer doesnt have the freedom to make that purchase If I might Dr Peter Rost the same guy just I quoted said During my time responsible for a region in northeastern Europe I never oncenot onceheard the drug industry regulatory agencies the government or anyone else say this practice was unsafe and I personally think it is outright derogatory to claim that the Americans would not be able to handle the reimportation of drugs when the rest of the educated world can do this Dr Peter Rost also said The biggest argument against reimportation is safety What everyone has conveniently forgotten to tell you is that in Europe reimportation of drugs has been in place for 20 years Hank MCKinnell a former Pfizer CEO said Name an industry in which competition is allowed to flourishcomputers telecommunications small package shipping retailing entertainment and Ill show you lower prices higher quality more innovation and better customer service There is nary an exception OK there is one So far the health care industry seems immune to the discipline of competition Nowhere is that more evident with respect to pharmaceutical drugs The question today is Will we once again offer a prescription drug importation bill that will save consumers and the Federal Government 100 billion that contains safety standards that do not exist even in the domestic drug supply that will not pose risk but in fact reduces risk reduces prices for the American people provides fair pricing for American consumers Will we be able to vote for that legislation that I and Senator MCCain Senator Grassley Senator Stabenow Senator Klobuchar and so many others have brought to the floor of the Senate The answer is yes we are going to vote on that The question is In the 7 days since I have offered this amendment has the pharmaceutical industry been able to pry enough people away from this amendment because they are raising all kinds of issues of safety How many votes will we get By the way the sidebyside amendment is a killer amendment We will have a second vote A lot of people will say We will vote for the Dorgan amendment and then vote to nullify it by voting for the Lautenberg amendment Let me read the AARP letter which was sent yesterday On behalf of the AARPs nearly 40 million members we urge you to support the DorganSnowe importation amendment to HR 3590 the Senate health care reform legislation This amendment provides for the safe legal importation of lower priced prescription drugs from abroad CBO has scored the amendment as saving taxpayers more than 19 billion That is just for the Federal Government There is much more for consumers We also urge you to vote against an alternative importation amendment proposed by Senators Lautenberg Carper and Menendez AARP strongly opposes this amendment because it includes the unnecessary addition of a certification requirement which is simply a thinly veiled effort to undermine importation and preserve the status quo of high drug prices So there it is We are always told this bill is a finely crafted piece it is like embroidering with some sophisticated colors This is a finely crafted piece and dont mess with it because if you adopt your amendment somehow the whole thing is going to come apart It is like pulling a thread on a cheap suit You pull the thread and an arm falls off God forbid anybody should adopt an amendment such as this Here we are 7 days after I offered this amendment and we have a circumstance where we now have a sidebyside in order to try to nullify it We have had all kinds of dealing going on I have not been a part of it I dont know what the deals are I dont know what time they were consummated Somebody told me late last night I am like an old Senator who served long ago I am not part of any deal I am not part of it This deal is for the American people We are going to pass some health care legislation and then we are going to shuffle around with our hands in our pockets maybe thumbing our suspenders sticking out our shined shoes and say We did this all right We feel really good about it but we couldnt do a thing about prescription drug prices We couldnt do that We didnt have the support because the pharmaceutical industry wouldnt let us Oh really Maybe at lastat long long lastthere will be sufficient friends on this vote on behalf of the American people to say We stand with the consumer We are standing with the American consumers today We like the pharmaceutical industry We want them to produce prescription drugs We want them to make profits We just dont want them to charge us 10 times 5 times 3 times or double what is being charged others in the world for the identical prescription drug because we dont think it is fair to the American people Mr President how much time remains I suggest the absence of a quorum I dont know whether the Senator from New Jersey has other speakers I believe we have a couple other speakers who will be here I suggest the absence of a quorum President I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be dispensed with President I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be charged against both sides We have people coming to speak If not I will take some additional time as perhaps will the Senator from New Jersey I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that it be charged to all sides equally President I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded President I did not speak about the letter from the Food and Drug Administration My colleagues have described this letter which I said could have come out of a copying machine A similar letter has come each time we consider this legislation It is interesting to me that we export a lot of American jobs All kinds of jobs are leaving our country Then we import contaminated wallboard childrens toys that kill kids And yes that has happened We import contaminated pet food and contaminated toothpaste We import 85 percent of the seafood into this country every day85 percent of the seafoodand 1 percent is inspected by the way One percent of that seafood is inspected The rest is not We import fruits and vegetables I am wondering if the Food and Drug Administration is sending letters around with concern about the risk to health of fruits and vegetables and seafoods that are not inspected In many places these products are produced with insecticides and various things that would not be permitted in this country I am wondering where the FDAs letter is with respect to that I called the Food and Drug Administration I talked with the head of the FDA I said I understand there are rumors around that you are going to send a letter here This was 24 hours before the letter came The head of the FDA said I know nothing of such a letter My question is Where did the letter come from Who prompted the letter I think I know I find it interesting I dont see anybody at the FDA sending letters here about the issue of safety on fruits vegetables and fish They raise the issue of safety with respect to a drug importation bill which has the most specific and the most rigorous safety standards not only for imported drugs but for the existing domestic drug supply the kind of safety standards that the pharmaceutical industry has objected to for many years I yielded to the Senator for a question If he would truncate it I would appreciate it Reclaiming my time the answer is selfevident by the question Of course we would benefit from stricter standards for fish vegetables and fruits That was the point I was making But what we have done with respect to importation of prescription drugs is we have included batch lots and pedigrees and tracers that do not exist in the existing drug supply Why The existing drug supply does not have those provisions because they have been objected to over the years by the pharmaceutical industry We have put in place procedures that will make this safe You cannot say the same thing about fruits vegetables and seafood unfortunately A lot of work needs to be done there But we do not bring a bill to the floor of the Senate a bipartisan group of legislators a bill that would in any way injure or provide problems with respect to safety What we do is bring to the floor of the Senate legislation that dramatically enhances the margin of safety for prescription drugs But I understand I understand completely If I were trying to protect and I were the drug industry trying to protect billions boy I understand the exertion of effort to try to protect that My only point is this I have a beef with an industry that decides they are going to overcharge the American people in some cases 10 times more in some cases 5 double the price that is paid in other parts of the world for the identical drug I dont think that is fair and I dont think we should allow it to continue The way to prevent it is to give the American people the freedomevery European has that freedom Let me end with how I began For somebody to come out here and say this is about unregulated untested drugs is absolute sheer nonsense It is not We do not have to debate what words mean and what words say That is not a debate we ought to take time to have All we have to do is read it and then represent it accurately which has not been the case on the floor of the Senate regrettably I yield the floor I suggest the absence of a quorum President I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded President is it the case when a quorum call is requested it is equally charged President I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be equally charged on both sides I suggest the absence of a quorum President some issues we deal with here in the Senate are unbelievably complicated This one is not This is painfully simple the question of whether the American people should be charged and continue paying the highest prices in the world for brandname prescription drugsmy amendment says nofrom other countries in which there is a safe chain of custody that is identical to ours The American people ought to have the freedom to shop for those lower priced FDAapproved drugs that are sold there at a fraction of the price I especially wish to thank Senator Begich from Alaska for his work This is bipartisan with a broad number of Democrats and Republicans working on this importation of prescription drugs bill giving the American people the freedom to acquire lower priced drugs Senator Begich has been a significant part of that effort I want to say thanks to him for his work on this amendment President this amendment will save 100 billion in 10 years nearly 20 billion for the Federal Government and nearly 80 billion for the American consumers But early on one of my colleagues said this is about untested unregulated drugs coming from oh parts of the Soviet Union That is so unbelievable It is not describing the amendment I have offered We are talking about a chain of custody that is identical to the United States When that is the caseif it is the casewhy would the American people not have the freedom to acquire that same drug when it is sold at onetenth the price onefifth onethird or onehalf the price Why not give the American people that freedom Look I want the pharmaceutical industry to do well to make profits to make prescription drugs I just want fair pricing for the American people I do not have a beef with the industry I want them to do well I want them however to give the American people a fair price because we are paying the highest prices in the world for brandname prescription drugs and I think it is flat out unfair This amendment will fix that There is a competing amendment that nullifies it that simply says all this is going to go away and we are done with this bill and nothing has happened to put the brakes on prescription drug prices I hope my colleagues will stand with me and with the American people saying We support fair drug prices for the American people That is what we are going to vote on in a few minutes I appreciate the questions from the Senator from Alaska Madam President this amendment is about fair pricing for prescription drugs for the American people A colleague of mine just came up to me and said My daughter takes Nexium It costs her 1000 a month I said I happen to have a chart about Nexium here This illustrates better than I know how to illustrate the difference in pricing Here is what Nexium costs 424 worth of Nexium in the United States is sold for 40 in Great Britain 36 in Spain 37 in Germany 67 in France If you like this kind of pricing where the American people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs if you like this kind of pricing then you ought to vote against this amendment But this amendment is bipartisanRepublicans and Democrats Over 30 Members of this Senate have supported this approach saying lets provide fair pricing for a change for the American people We should not be paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs All I ask is that you support this amendment to give the American people the opportunity for fair pricing for a change We have had these votes before All I say is this The pharmaceutical industry flexes its muscles and defeats an attempt for fair prescription drug prices for the American people so we can keep paying the highest prices in the world And then there is another amendment offered that makes it seem like something is being done when in fact nothing is going to be done nothing will change Do not vote for this amendment and go home and say you have done something about the price of prescription drugs because your constituents will know better This amendment does nothing If you believe at the end of the evening we should do nothing by all means vote for it Dont count me in on that vote President I would like to announce that the Committee on Indian Affairs will meet on Thursday December 17 2009 at 215 pm in room 628 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building to conduct a business meeting on pending committee issues to be followed by an oversight hearing on the Cobell v Salazar Settlement Agreement Those wishing additional

dont you proceed President it has been a very interesting discussion listening to the Senator from New Hampshire Several points One the underlying bill is clearly not a net increase in government spending on health care The numbers are bandied about by those on the other side 1 trillion 25 trillion et cetera I do acknowledge and thank the Senator from New Hampshire for saying yes it is all paid for He did say that He did agree this is all paid for So I just hope when other Senators on that side of the aisle start talking about this big cost 1 trillion 2 trillion whatever that they do admit it is paid for The ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee flatly said Yes it is all paid for I would hope other Members on that side of the aisle heed the statement of the Senator from New Hampshire ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee for saying it is all paid for But dont take my word for it or his word It is what the CBO says In fact let me quote from a letter to Senator Reid not too long ago The CBO expects that during the decade following the 10 year budget window the increases and decreases in Federal budgetary commitment to health care stemming from this legislation would roughly balance out so that there would be no significant change in that commitment That is a commitment to health care to government health care spending no change basically It is flat Although it is a little better than flat because the subsequent CBO letter has said the underlying bill achieves about 130 billion in deficit reduction over 10 years and onequarter of a percent of GDP reduction in the next 10 years The Senator from New Hampshire talks about large deficits this country is facing That is true Frankly all of us in the Senate have a responsibility to try to reduce that budget deficit as best and as reasonably as we possibly can Bear in mind this underlying health care bill helps reduce the budget deficit Sometimes people on the other side like to suggest that 1 trillion over 10 years will add to the budget deficit Again we have definitely established it does not add to the budget deficit at all not one thin dime In addition we actually reduce the budget deficit through health care reform through this underlying legislation We all know the Medicare trust fund is in jeopardy in part because baby boomers are retiring more but also because health care costs are going up at such a rapid rate That is health care costs for everybody It is health care costs for me for every Senator for every senior for businesses Lets not forget we spend in America about 60 percent more per person on health care than the next most expensive country about 50 to 60 percent more per person The trend is going in the wrong direction We are going to spend about 33 trillion in America on health care over the next 10 years That is going to be somewhat evenly divided between public expenditures and private Every other country in the world has figured out ways to limit the rate of growth of increase in health care spending We havent We are the only industrialized countryin fact developing countrythat hasnt figured out how to get some handle on the rate of growth of increase in health care spending One could say Gee lets forget about it Just let the present trend continue We all bandy about different figures One I am fond of at least remembering is the average health care insurance policy in America today costs about 13000 If we do nothing over 8 years it will be 30000 That is a much higher rate of increase than income for Americans It means the disparity between wages of the average American and what they are paying on health care will widen all the more if we do nothing We have to do something This legislation is a goodfaith effort to begin to get a handle on the rate of growth of spending in this country The Senator from New Hampshire was being honest frankly Some on the other side are being not quite so honest He is basically saying Yes it is true we are not cutting beneficiary cuts although he talks about Medicare Advantage Let me point out that there is nothing in this legislation that requires any reductions in any beneficiary cuts In fact guaranteed benefits under Medicare are expressly not to be cut under the express language of this bill The portion we are talking about is Medicare Advantage The fact is there is nothing in this bill that requires any cuts at all in Medicare Advantage payments Those Medicare Advantage payments are in addition to the guaranteed Medicare payments such as gym memberships things such as that which are not part of traditional Medicare Why do I say there is nothing in there that requires cuts for those extras That is because the decision on what benefits or what extras Medicare Advantage plans have to give the guaranteed benefits that is by law But the decision as to what extras should go to their members is a decision based not upon us in the government in Congress not upon the HHS Secretary it is based on the corporate officers of these companies They are overpaid Medicare Advantage plans right now Everybody knows they are overpaid Even they privately will tell you they are overpaid They are overpaid based upon legislation that Congress passed in 2003 the Medicare Part D by setting these high benchmarks They are overpaid The MedPAC commission also said they are overpaid to the tune of about between 14 and 18 percent So the reductions that are provided for in this bill in Medicare Advantage plans the effect of those reductions is up to the officers of those plans They could cut premiums people otherwise pay They could cut benefits to help themselves help their salaries They could cut stockholders They could cut administrative costs They can decide what they want to do That is solely a decision of the executives of Medicare Advantage plans Private insurance plans is what they are They are private insurance plans so there is nothing here that says the fringes the extras have to be cut at all Those executives could keep those fringes and maybe have a little less return to their stockholders or maybe make some savings in their administrative costs maybe not increase their salaries There is nothing here that requires those fringes those extras to be cut nothing whatsoever The Senator from New Hampshire says Oh it is about 400 billion to 500 billion of reduced payments to providers in this legislation That is true Well lets look and see what the consequences of that are First of all that means the Medicare trust funds solvency is extended It is more flush with cash I would think all Senators here would like to extend the life of the Medicare trust fund A good way to do that is by what we are doing in this bill saving about 450 billion over 10 years that otherwise would be paid to Medicare providers is not being paid and those benefits inure to the trust fund There is no disputenone whatsoeverthat this legislation extends the life of the Medicare trust fund by another 5 years That is because of those changes in the structure and also because there are no cuts in benefits There are no cuts in benefits I say to Senators Although sometimes Senators on that side of the aisle like to either say or strongly imply there are cuts in benefits there are no cuts in benefits There are no cuts in the guaranteed benefits with the basic benefits and there are no required cuts for the fringes or the extras because the officers can make that decision not to cut if they want to That is their choice as I have explained a few minutes ago Lets look to see what the other side proposed not too many years ago back in 1997 They proposed cutting the Medicare benefit structure cutting payments to providers big timebig time They proposed a 124percent cut to providers back in 1997 when they were in charge They did that in part to save the Medicare trust fund to extend the life of the Medicare trust fund I have a hard time understanding why back then it was a good thing to do which was about three times more of a cutlets see twice as heavy a cut to Medicare providers back then in 1997 than it is today Nobody over there has explained why it was the right thing to do back then but not the right thing to do today when the goal is the same The goal is the same that is to extend the solvency of the trust fund One could sayI think the Senator from New Hampshire did saywell lets take those savings which do extend the solvency of the trust fund but nothe saidprovide another program I think he wants to use that to cut the deficit That is what I think he wants to do That is a very basic fundamental values question I think this country should face that is do we want to set up a system where virtually all Americans have health insurance We are the only industrialized country in the world that does not have a system where its citizens have health insurancethe only industrialized country in the world It is a very basic question I think we should ask ourselves as Americans In every other industrialized country health insurance health care is a right That is the starting point In every other country that has a health care system health care is a right that everybody should have health care Of course it is true people are different Some are tall some are short Some are very athletically endowed some are not Some are smart some are not so smart But health care does not carethat is a way to put itwhether you are dumb smart tall skinny It affects everybody that is diseases affect everybody and everybody needs health care regardless of your station in life regardless of your income regardless of whether you are an egghead you are brilliant or an athlete It makes no difference whatsoever We are Americans I frankly believe other countries on that point have it right that is that they treat all their citizens basically equally because disease is indiscriminatewho is going to get diseaseaccidents are indiscriminatewho is going to get in an accidentand so forth So we could take this 400 billion 500 billion and reduce the deficit with it and forget any health insurance coverage That would be an option That is a legitimate question we could ask ourselves I frankly think the better choice is to take that 400 billion 500 billion which does extend the solvency of the trust fund and help set up a way help set up a system so all Americans have health insurance We do it in a way that reduces the budget deficit We do it in a way that reduces the budget deficit in the first 10 years and also in the next 10 years I again repeat if trimming the rate of growth of provider payments was OK back in 1997that was twice as much as today back then to extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fundwhy isnt it OK today to do half as much to extend the life of the trust fund in this case for 5 more years and at the same time help provide health insurance benefits for people who deserve it Lets not forget hospitals want us to do this They want everyone to have health insurance Doctors want us to have a system where everybody has health insurance whether it is Medicaid or it is private health insurance All the providers want it The pharmaceutical industry does the home health industry does the hospice industry does The durable medical equipment manufacturers want it They all want it because they know it is the right thing to do They also know they are not going to get hurt I heard some reference here that some HHS actuary commenting on the House bill said oh gee it might scare providers and whatnot but we actually got subsequent information which showed that letterthat actuary admitted it is extremely variable what he came up with There are lots of factors he did not take into consideration I also have statements from hospital administrators saying no way are they going to be allowed In fact lets remind ourselves of this It was not too many weeks ago a couple months agoremember that meetingwhen all the health care providers and the insurance industry went to the White House They were all over there What did they pledge to President Obama to help get health care reform passed That they would cut their reimbursements by 2 trillion over 10 years They would cut They agreed to cut their payments that Uncle Sam makes to them in the health care system by 2 trillion over 10 years It was widely reported in the papers What did we do in this bill We reduced the rate of increase in payments to providers not by 2 trillion not by 1 trillion less than 12 trillion over that same 10year period So if they could commit back then to 2 trillion you would think my gosh this is a quarter of that That is not too bad and not going to hurt anybody and providers are not going to be leaving I might add too I have a letter from AARP to the majority leader dated today It has been handed to me In part it says The legislation before the Senate properly focuses on provider reimbursement reforms Most importantly the legislation does not reduce any guaranteed Medicare benefits This is a letter today from the American Association of Retired People I will reread that portion It is addressed to Senator Reid The legislation before the Senate properly focuses on provider reimbursement reforms And man we need about a week or so to talk about all the reforms in this bill that are so important so we have a better health care system focusing more on quality than we currently do in the United States system Again Most importantly the legislation does not reduce any guaranteed Medicare benefits In the letter they also say AARP believes that savings can be found in Medicare through smart targeted changes aimed at improving health care delivery eliminating waste and inefficiency and aggressively weeding out fraud and abuse That is important It is very important I might add too that every person today who pays a Part B premiumevery American todayevery senior today who pays that quarter that 25 percent of Part B today pays also for the waste that is in the system today especially under Part B So if we get the waste out we also will be able to reduce that Part B premium payment that seniors have to pay too I think that is a good thing So the more you dig into this bill the more you see the good features I do not think all the good features have been pointed out in this bill One of our jobs here is to point out what they are so when this legislation passesmark my words this legislation is going to be enacted It is going to be enacted I will not say exactly when but certainly if not this month it will be signed by the President either this month or next monththen Americans are going to start to see Oh gee there is a lot in there that is good I didnt know about that That is good I like that It may not be perfect but they started in the right direction That is pretty good They are going to like it I hear all these references to polls around here and that is because of all the confusion in part But once it is passed and people look to see what is in itthey will look to see what is in it because that is the law They are forced to look to see what is in it because that is the law I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle may say Yes when they look to see what is in it they will see how bad it is I disagree That is not my view My view is the more this legislation is subjected to the light of day the disinfectant of sunshine which shows what is in this bill the more people are going to say Hey that was a good thing they did back then in December or January I yield the floor As soon as I get the page number I guess I would like to ask the Senator from Oklahoma a question What page I dont have it with me right now but there are no required reductions in fringes or extras Will the Senator yield for a question May I ask the Senator another question Is it paid for That is a second question I would love to debate with the Senator But on the first question only the Senator admits it is paid for Does Medicare decide what the benefits will be for those folks I think we all know the House has taken action on physician reimbursement and the Senate will also do so before we adjourn That is the socalled doc fix That is a separate issue That will be paid for Putting the doctor issue aside health care reformand I say that because we take up the doc fix virtually every year We dont take up health care reform every year That is an entirely separate proposition separate legislative endeavor If the Senator will bear with me and take the doc fix off the table for a secondwe can address that laterhealth care reformto use a 10year number or when you start in 2010 or in 2014 wherever you are startingeither there is 1 trillion or 25 trillion depending where you start not getting into how it is paid for Is it paid for and therefore it is not deficit am I not correct Is it true there are no cuts in guaranteed beneficiary paymentsnone whatsoeverin this legislationin guaranteed benefits Is it true those provisions are not guaranteed provisions I am talking about guaranteed benefits that seniors expect to get when they go to the doctor fee for service expected benefits under ordinary Medicare not benefits that a private plan may pay in addition President I noted that the other side in the last couple 3 days has tried to make the case that seniors Medicare benefits are in jeopardy because this legislation cuts Medicare I have heard that statement over and over and over and over again In fact the last speaker on the other side made that same point I am confounded I am very surprised when I hear those statements Why am I very surprised Because it is totally patently false It is false It is untrue There are no benefits cut here none One could say that with the private plans the Medicare Advantage plans which are vastly overpaidthe nonpartisan MedPAC organization states they are vastly overpaid by about 14 percentone could say those private plansit is not Medicare those private plans Medicare Advantage those are not Medicare plans those are private plans private insurance plansthey may be overprescribing some nonguaranteed benefits for beneficiaries things such as eyeglasses or something like that which might be cut back That is true But none of the guaranteed benefitsthe basic benefits under Medicare that every senior knows about when he or she goes to the doctor and it is care under Medicareis reduced None Nothing is cut In fact this legislation adds benefits to seniors For example it virtually fills up this thing we call the doughnut hole That is the portion of prescription drug payments that seniors otherwise would have to pay But we say 500 of that is going to be paid for and the rest of it is going to be paid for at least for 1 more year So that is an additional benefit Then all the screening provisions that are in this bill that is an additional benefit There are many other benefits that are added onto the ordinary benefits seniors have So it is not trueit is not truethat the basic guaranteed benefits under Medicare are cut None of the guaranteed benefits under Medicare are cutnone So it is totally untrue It is false when people make the claim that Medicare is being cut They are being very clever the people who are making those claims What they are saying when they say Medicare will be cutthey want you to think they mean benefits will be cutbut deep in their mind what they are holding back in their mindwell when pressed they will agree well it is the Medicare providers it is the hospitals it is the medical equipment manufacturers it is the pharmaceutical industry That is being cut That is Medicare that is being cut and therefore that will hurt seniors That is kind of the way they get around it Well the fact is the way you preserve the solvency of the trust fund is to make sure there are not so many payments frankly by Uncle Sam going to pay for all the doctors and hospitals and so forth so the solvency of the trust fund is extended Right now this legislation extends the solvency of the Medicare trust fund If this legislation were not to pass the Medicare trust fund would probably go insolvent in about the year 2017 But this legislation extends the solvency of the trust fund for at least 5 more years to 2022 So I wish to make it very clear that this legislation we are considering does not cut Medicare benefits In fact the hospitals and docs I would say are going to find at least a 5percent increase in growth over the next 10 years in payments to them under the Medicare Programgrowth I have a chart which I showed yesterday on the floor It showed for each of the various years it is a 5percent increase in growth for all those industries They are being cut 15 percent but that is from a 65percent growth to net down to a 5percent growth for each of the years You ask analysts on Wall Street how hospitals are doing They are doing great under this legislation You ask analysts on Wall Street how the pharmaceutical industry is doing They are doing great under this legislation You ask any analyst about other industrieshome health care hospice care you name itthey are all doing OK Wall Street analysts say they are doing fine Why are they doing fine Why objectively are they doing fine Why do the CEOs of these organizations not grumble too much Because they know what they may lose in a little bit of a reduction in their paymentsthey will still get big hefty paymentsthey will make up in volume because so many more people will have health insurance They know that They are going to make a lot of money So they are OK So it is not true that Medicare is going to go broke under this legislation First of all there is no reduction in benefits That is very clear Senator Dodd read a letter from AARP making that very clear Also the reductions are not reductions in provider payments they are reductions in the rate of growth of provider payments and they are going to do fine Providers do not care that much because they are making it on volume because everybody is going to have health insurance They have quite a bita 5percent growth rate anyway So it is not trueit is not truethat Medicare is in jeopardy because of this legislation It is not true that benefits are going to be cut In fact just the opposite is true This legislation strengthens benefits increases benefits extends the length of the Medicare trust fund to a future date further down the road so it stays solvent for many years than otherwise is the case This legislation helps seniors It helps seniors contrary to what you are hearing on the other side that it hurts seniors If you just look at the facts not the rhetoricnot the rhetoric but just look at the facts look at the facts and look at who the supporters of this legislation are and objective groups and what they say about this legislationyou cannot help but be compelled to the conclusion that this legislation is not only good for seniors it is very good for seniors Recognition of the Minority Leader The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Republican leader is recognized Does the Senator agree this legislation will extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund for 5 years and failure to pass this would mean the solvency of the Medicare trust fund would not be extended for 5 years President the Republican leader a few moments ago said this bill raises costs With all due respect to my good friend from Kentucky that statement is false Just this week the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office the organization that analyzes legislationand both sides both bodies depend on it it is a very professional outfit I might addsaid our bill would reduce premiums not increase but reduce premiums for 93 percent of Americans And for all Americans it would make sure that better quality insurance is available Let me state that a little bit differently The Congressional Budget Office said that for 93 percent of Americans premiums would be reduced It is true that for 7 percent that is not the case Those are Americans whose incomes are too high to qualify for subsidies that is the tax credits buying insurance in exchange But those 7 percent would get a lot better insurance a lot higher quality insurance than they get today because of the insurance market reforms that are in this legislation The provisions prevent insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions health status the committee market rating provisions no rescissions et cetera So for all Americans it is true that this legislation will provide better quality insurance comparing apples with apples There is a reduction for 93 percent of Americans The other 7 percent would be in the individual market and they would have a lot higher quality insurance So if the quality is much higher it would exceed the increase in premiums They would be getting a better deal than they would otherwise be getting CBO looked at this for the year 2016 They didnt look at it for other years but at least that is the case for 2016 a reduction not an increase but a reduction In fact for many in the nongroup market those who individually buy insurance they would find their premiums would be reduced about 40 or 50 percent About 60 percent of those in the nongroup market are finding their insurance premiums would be reduced I dont have the exact figure in front of me but it is in the neighborhood of a 40 or 50percent reduction in premiums That is due to tax credits Again CBO says those tax credits would cover nearly twothirds of premiums So I guess I was a little conservative It is a little more than 40 or 50 percent It would cover twothirds of premiums CBO said those getting these tax credits would pay for roughly 56 percent to 59 percent lower premiums than they would without our bill Those are real savings That is with respect to the premiums What about outofpocket costs This legislation has absolute limits on outofpocket costs Today insurance companies can sell you a policy you pay certain premiums but there is no limit on the outof pocket costs you might have to pay Your deductible is so high for example This legislation puts an absolute limit so no policy can be sold that allows you to have outofpocket costs above a certain amount I think it is 6000 for an individual and it might be double that for a family But there is a limit So this bill does not as stated by the minority leader raise costs In fact it reduces costs In addition there are many people who say Oh gosh this is a 1 trillion bill Some people even say it is a 25 trillion bill Senators on the other side of the aisle make those statements and they say this to try to scare us I will be honest with you I dont know if they believe it They like saying it because it is a nice good scare tactic I say I am not sure they believe it I wonder if they believe it because when you read the legislation it is deficit neutral It does not add to the deficit We have a budget resolution Under that budget resolution health care legislation for the next 10 years has to be deficit neutral It cannot add one thin dime to the deficit So I am a little curious when people talk about a 1 trillion bill In fact it reduces the deficit by 130 billion over a 10year period That is what the Congressional Budget Office says the professional nonpartisan budget office In the second 10 years the CBO says our bill reduces the deficit by a onequarter of 1 percent of the gross domestic product That is roughly 12 trillion In the second 10 years this legislation reduces the deficit by 12 trillion That is a reduction in the deficit I dont know why these people are saying on the other side that this is a trilliondollar bill One saidand I will not mention his name the other day that this is a 25 trillion bill That is not true It is just not true because it is paid for It would only be fair for them to say it is paid for I think it is fair to get both sides of the story not just one side It does cost 1 trillion over 10 years but it is more than paid for over 10 years Those who say 25 trillion they start at 2014 up to 2020 and say that is why it costs so much It is paid for during those years too Let me make it very clear this bill doesnt raise costs In fact it lowers costs and the CBO says so It doesnt add to the Federal deficit In fact it reduces the Federal deficit I urge everyone to look at the facts closely whenever we hear statements made by anybody including me I urge people to listen to the words and read between the lines and see what is really going on Like my father used to say Dont believe everything you read and only half of what you hear Take everything with a few grains of salt The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr KIRK The Senator from Tennessee is recognized Which colleague is the Senator asking that Might I respond to the Senator The basic question obviously is how to protect Medicare benefits I think most of us would say how do we protect Medicare benefits and extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund I think we would all agree that excessive payments to providers would cause insolvency of the trust funds to come earlier rather than later We all agree with that proposition The next question is What would excessive payments to providers be Do providers get paid excessively I think that is an honest question we should ask ourselves in a way to help extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund In fact in 1995 many Senators especially on the other side of the aisle did say just that that we have to cut Medicare in order to save benefits That was made by many Senators I have them right in front of me if anybody wants to hear them I am not going to go through all of that but it is the truth That is exactly what we are doing in this bill We are trying to help extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by cutting down on excessive provider payments from the Medicare trust fund How do we decide whether payments are excessive That is the basic question here All we can do is just give it our best shot make our best judgment I think it makes sense to look at the recommendations by outside independent groups what they think One is MedPAC the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission That is an outside group as we all know that advises Congress on Medicare payments As Members of Congress we are not totally competent to know exactly what dollars should go to which industry group We have too many other obligations to think about As Senators we must be responsible to do the best we can MedPAC has said these groups have been overpaid And Wall Street analysts tend to agree In fact MedPAC said with respect to Medicare Advantage that they have been overpaidI forget the exact amount but much less than the 118 billion reduction in this bill In fact I totaled up and looked at the projected growth rate of providershospitals nursing homes home health hospice PhRMA you name itand on average their growth rate over the next decade is going to be 612 percent That is the growth rate of providers We decided to trim that a little bit by 15 percent So it is 5 percent It is a 5percent growth rate in an attempt to try to find the right levels of reimbursement to providers which will also help extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund When we talk to providers they basically agree with those cuts They basically agree Why do they basically agree They basically agree because they know that with much more coverage with many more people having health insurance they could spread out their business They may lose a little on margin but they can pick it up on volume That is exactly what their business plan is under this bill Wall Street analysts sayI quote themthese industries are doing great they are doing well under this bill They are not getting hurt So we do achieve a winwinI dont like that phrase by the way but I will use it herewhere the solvency of the trust fund is being extended and where reimbursement rates to providers are fairnot being hurt it is fair And that is why they want this bill by and large Most groups tend to want this bill enacted because they know it is good for the country it is good for the seniors and it is good for them too With all due respect I did not say that I did not talk about doctors overpaid If I may say to my friend from Tennessee this legislation pays more to primary care doctors a 10percent increase in Medicare reimbursement for each of the next 5 years I did not say doctors You already said it but I think it is worth repeating Most seniors as they pay Part B premiums under fee for service dont get any benefit whatsoever The figure I sawI guess it is 90 a year they pay extra and get no benefit from it If the Senator will yield for another question might I ask my friend if it isnt also true that in the June MedPAC report it states that Medicare Advantage overpayments cost taxpayers an extra 12 billion I think the point the Senator from Illinois is making needs to be underlined two or three or four times hereand the Senator from Connecticut has made it too and that is there is a huge distinction between Medicare and these private insurance plans What Medicare Advantage is overpaidthat is what these insurance companies are overpaid and a lot of that goes back to the Part D drug bill and so forthdo those overpayments necessarily mean better benefits for persons who signed up for those plans If that is true why might that be the case just so people understand Will the Senator yield for a question Fringes such as gym memberships and extras such as that The bill basically provides that there be no reductions in guaranteed Medicare payments There is a long list of what guaranteed Medicare payments are Even the Medicare Advantage companies which are private companies with officers and they have stockholdersthey have to report to their board of directors and they have all these administrative costs very huge admin costs The reductions to Medicare Advantagethe application of reductions to Medicare Advantage plans are at the discretion of the officers The officers can decide they are not going to cut the fringes that is the fringes and the extras that are beyond in addition to the guaranteed Medicare benefits If an officer wants to it is his discretion I am assuming Will the Senator yield Isnt it true that the MedPAC commission came to the conclusion that the Medicare Advantage plans are overpaid It is also true that it is their recommendation that the Medicare plans overpaid by the amount of 14 percent If they are overpaid doesnt that necessarily mean there are reductions in payments attributable to each beneficiary by definition If they are overpaid In 2003 I made the mistake and agreed to give the Medicare Advantage plans way more money than they deserved And as the Senator from Oklahoma has said they are overpaid But isnt that a pretty good systemdont put too many eggs in one basket Doesnt each keep the others on their toes a little bit Doesnt this legislation provide for more competition than currently exists President I ask unanimous consent that Senator Whitehouse Senator Stabenow Senator Dodd and I be allowed to engage in a colloquy I ask my colleagues is it not true that basically in America although all of America spends about 25 trillion on health care basically it is 5050 It is 41 or 42 percent public and about 60 percent private We in America have roughly a 5050 system today is that right This legislation before us basically retains that current division What we are doing is coming up with uniquely American ideas We are not Great Britain France or Canada We are roughly 5050a little more private in fact In 2007 it was 46 percent public and about 54 percent private Roughly that is where we are It might change ever so slightly But we are not those other countries we are America This legislation before us maintains that philosophy is that correct I ask my colleagues is there anything in this legislation which will interfere with the doctorpatient relationship that is to date people choose their own doctors whichever doctor they want They can by and large go to the hospital they want although the doctor may send them to another hospital Is there anything in this legislation that diminishes that freedom of choice patients would have to choose their doctor What about the procedures doctors might want to choose for their patients Is there anything in this legislation which interferes with the decision a physician might make as to which procedure to prescribe in consultation with his or her patient I might ask my friendthat is very trueCould he explain maybe how doctors may be in this legislation empowered to have better information to help them provide even better care What are some of the provisions I think it is important not to overpromise because some of these initiatives some of these programs will take a little time to take effect In fact some of the provisions do not take effect for a couple 3 years But still wouldnt my colleagues agree that some of these are going to probably yield tremendous dividends in the future especially generally the focus on quality not outcomes reimbursing physicians and hospitals based on quality not outcomes the pilot projects the bundling the counter care organizations and other similar efforts in this legislation One of the two or both may want to comment on that point I think it is a point worth making Some people are worried perhaps gee there they go back there in Congress They talk about wastewhich is good we want to get rid of waste But then when they talk about waste they talk about cutting out the waste some think Gee if they are cutting out the waste and they are cutting health care reimbursements gee wont that hurt health care in America Wont that harm health care in America Wont that reduce quality If they are cutting so much 600 billion 700 billion 800 billionthat is a lot of moneyarent they going to start cutting quality health care in America I see my good friend the chairman of the HELP Committee on the floor He may want to join in this discussion as well adding different points as to why the legislation we are putting together increases quality does not cut quality but it increases quality at the same time it reduces waste I wonder if my colleagues might comment on all of that because it is an extremely I think important point to drive home our legislation improves quality health care As he was speaking I was thinking of that article a lot of us have referred to often the June 1 New Yorker article by Atul Gawande comparing El Paso TX and MCAllen TX They are both border towns In El Paso health care expenditures per person are about half what they are in MCAllen And yet the outcomes in El Paso are better than they are in MCAllen One might ask Why in the world is that happening Why is there twice as much spent in MCAllen than El Paso and the outcomes are different The answer is we have a system which allows the MCAllens in the system that allows payment in basic quantity and volume as opposed to quality I believe it depends on the community what the culture is Some communities have a culture of patientfocused care The current system allows that but unfortunately if the culture in the community is more to make money our reimbursement system today allows for that as well So I think one of the things we are trying to do is to get more quality in the systemreimbursement to pay doctors and hospitalsmore quality as you have saidand that is going to even out a lot of the geographic disparities that have occurred in the country over time and so the quality will increase and the cost and the waste will decrease In fact it is interesting the Senator mentioned his name because not too long ago I asked him that question I said Why Dr Berwick is it that in some communities they get it and some they do not His answer was that sometimes there is somebodymaybe it is a hospital or someone who is a pretty dominant playerwho kind of starts it out and gets it right and that is true He invited 10 integrated systems to Washington DC to kind of talk over what works and what doesnt work These are not the bignamed institutions they are the lesser named institutions In fact one of them I can probably say is the Billings Clinic in Billings MTnot too widely known but they participated last yearthe same process and integration with the docs the acute care and the postacute care They have significantly cut costs they have significantly improved the quality and they are very proud of what they have done My mother was in the hospital 3 years agoin another hospital not the Billings Clinicand there was no discharge plan There was no way to help deliver health care for her when she left the hospital and went into a rehab centersort of a nursing home Sure enough she didnt get the proper meds she didnt get the proper attention the doctor did not see her every day or after that and lo and behold she had to be readmitted to the hospital She had a gastrointestinal issue and sure enough they took care of her back in the hospital But once she was discharged they did it right They improved upon the mistakes they had made So I saw it firsthand and it irritated the dickens out of me frankly in seeing how they did not pay sufficient attention to my mother If this happens to my mother my gosh I bet it is even worse in lots of other situations I made sure of that I was talking to the head of Denver Health It is an integrated system I have forgotten the name but she was so enthusiastic about the integration she performed with Denver Health I will give you one small example and it is one you just mentioned She said We have patients hereheart patientsand when they are discharged we ask them Are you taking your meds Are you controlling your blood pressure Are you taking your medication to control your blood pressure They say Oh yeah yeah yeah I am taking my meds She says Well why is your blood pressure so high The response is Well I I I Because they are integrated they check with their pharmacy which is part of their system to check the refill rate of the patients Sure enough they find their patients refill history shows they were not taking their meds So they get the patients back and they say You are not taking your meds They say Oh I guess I wasnt They tell them We are checking on you So sure enough they take their meds and they have a much better outcome generally with their cardio patients because of that integration I dont know how much longer my colleague wanted to speak but some time ago I know Senator Hatch wanted to speak at 5 oclock so I am trying to be traffic cop here 
S_WY_ENZI,2009-12-15,1997_2009; 1997_2009; 1997_2009; 1997_2009; 1997_2009,0180; 0177; 0178; 0179; 0181, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time be divided equally President I yield up to 20 minutes to the Senator from Alabama out of the leader time Reserving the right to object we have had constant speakers over here so we have used a lot of our time If we had known there was more vacant time and if we could have had some of the majoritys time we could have had a steady stream of speakers over here the whole time So we would reluctantly agree to the time being divided between the two sides as we have done that in all the times in the past but we want to reserve some time for our speakers as well We could have easily had people over here to speak President I rise today to talk about prescription drug importation As my colleagues know I oppose this proposal It is our job as Senators to debate the issues put forward our ideas and show where we stand I was disappointed that Democratic leadership chose to prevent the Senate from voting on amendments to improve this bill for the past 6 days I am however glad the impasse has finally been resolved I am not afraid to show where I stand on this issue Some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle support importation Some like me oppose it But my position is clear and does not change with the political winds The winds I am referring to include the arrangement that was reportedly negotiated with the drug manufacturers Under the terms of this backroom deal the drug manufacturers have reportedly agreed to 80 billion in price cuts and provided a commitment to spend 150 million in ads supporting the Reid bill In exchange Senate Democratic leadership and President Obama have reportedly agreed to block efforts to enact drug importation from Canada According to one Wall Street analysts report the Reid bill is expected to increase drug company profits by more than 137 billion over the next 4 years Lets do the math on that 80 billion in cuts leading to 137 billion in increased profits While this may be a good deal from the drug manufacturers and Senate Democrats it certainly is not a good deal for the American people Part of the reported deal will actually increase Medicare costs to the taxpayer because it creates an incentive for Medicare beneficiaries to continue using brandname drugs According to the Congressional Budget Office Federal Medicare costs will be increased by 15 billion over the next decade as a result of this deal In the last few days there have been new press reports highlighting how the drug manufacturers may have agreed to provide even deeper discounts on their brandname drugs No one knows how much more this deal will cost the taxpayers In addition to increasing the price Americans will pay for the Reid bill this deal appears to have also undermined Democratic support for a drug importation amendment My colleagues who believe importation is the right way to lower drug costs say that it will save the government 19 billion and consumers 80 billion over the next 10 years The majority leader has previously voted for drug importation President Obama supported drug importation when he was in the Senate The supporters of drug importation should be able to easily pass this amendment without any limitations Yet it looks like the supporters of drug importation will not succeed today It appears likely that safety certification language similar to language included in prior years will be added to this proposal My colleagues each know where they stand on the issue But the deal with the drug manufacturers is apparently so important that supporters of drug importation are going to vote against the proposal It is important for the American people to understand why there has been this change of heart on this issue The drug manufacturers are one of the few remaining health care groups that still support the Reid bill They have committed to spend 150 million to buy television ads to support the Democrats efforts on health reform If my Democratic colleagues fail to adopt drug importation without the safety language it is because the Senate Democratic leadership and the White House have decided they will do whatever it takes to keep the support of the drug manufacturers They believe that the money these companies will spend will be enough to convince the American people to support their efforts The American people already understand that the Reid bill is not a good deal for them They understand how this bill will raise their taxes increase their insurance premiums and cut Medicare benefits for millions of seniors That is why over 60 percent of Americans now oppose the Democratic health reform proposals No amount of advertising funded by the drug companies or anyone else is going to change that reality 
S_NC_HAGAN,2009-12-15,2009_2009,0032, President I rise today to speak about drug reimportation With millions of seniors balancing drug regimens that entail taking several medicines per day on a fixed income I believe we need to find a way to ensure that they have access to affordable drugs If we could reduce the cost of drugs with reimportation and guarantee the safety of those drugs I would be very supportive However I have serious doubts that we can adequately ensure the safety of our drug supply with the drug reimportation amendment proposed by my colleague from North Dakota Even without reimportation the United States has had trouble with counterfeit drugs At the height of the H1N1 epidemic this fall the FDA was warning consumers to be wary of counterfeit H1N1 treatments These counterfeits came from foreign online pharmacies In one instance the FDA seized socalled H1N1 treatment tablets from India and found them to contain talc and acetaminophen Last month the Washington Post reported on a coordinated global raid of counterfeit drugs from the United States to Europe to Singapore The United States discovered about 800 alleged packages of fake or suspicious prescription drugs including Viagra Vicodin and Claritin and shut down 68 alleged rogue online pharmacies Counterfeit pharmaceutical drugs are appearing on the market at increasingly alarming rates In 2007 drugs comprised 6 percent of the total counterfeit product seizures In 1 year they have now jumped to 10 percent of all counterfeit product seizures This growing problem is all about unscrupulous criminals preying on the sick and the elderly who are in desperate need of cheaper drugs But the consequences are harmful and in some cases deadly Officials estimate that some of these counterfeit drugs contain either a dangerous amount of active ingredients or were placebos Some counterfeits include toxic chemicals such as drywall material antifreeze and even yellow highway paint According to a recent Washington Post article tracing the origins of drugs such as Cialis and Viagra took investigators across the globe and back again Supposedly these drugs came from a warehouse in New Delhi though the online company selling the drug was headquartered in Canada and was licensed to sell medicine in Minnesota However when Federal officials investigated the drug origins further they actually found that the online Web site was registered in China its server was hosted in Russia and its headquarters had previously been listed in Louisiana On a local level near our capital the Baltimore Sun yesterday reported on the death of a University of Maryland pharmacologist Carrie John Ms John suffered an allergic reaction to a counterfeit version of a legal drug in the United States but purchased illegally from the Philippines Apparently the counterfeit drug so closely resembled the legal version that two pharmacologists conducting the analysis after Ms Johns death could not tell the difference Local police have yet to identify the contents of the counterfeit drug A few of my colleagues have already mentioned the letter sent last week by FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg outlining the safety concerns the FDA has about reimportation Specifically the FDA stated that importing nonFDAapproved prescription drugs posed four potential risks to patients Let me go over those four risks No 1 The drug may not be safe and effective because it did not undergo the rigorous FDA regulatory review process No 2 The drug may not be a consistently made high quality product because the facility in which it was manufactured was not reviewed by the FDA No 3 The drug may not be substitutable with the FDAapproved product because of differences in composition or manufacturing No 4 The drug could be contaminated or counterfeit as a result of inadequate safeguards in the supply chain If the agency that oversees drug safety is saying it would have difficulty guaranteeing the safety of our Nations drug supply with reimportation I have grave concerns particularly since the FDA is already underfunded and understaffed But lets take a moment to examine how Europe which does allow reimportation has fared in terms of safety British authorities say counterfeit drugs often exchange hands between middlemen and are repackaged multiple times before reaching a legitimate hospital or pharmacist This creates opportunities for counterfeit products often produced in China and shipped through the Middle East to penetrate the European market President I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes In 2008 British authorities identified 40000 doses of counterfeit Casodex a hormone treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer and Plavix a blood thinner More recently the European Union seized 34 million fake tablets at customs points in all member countries In other countries around the world the World Health Organization estimates that up to 30 percent of the medicines on sale may be counterfeit As a result numerous people have died Earlier this year 80 infants in Nigeria died from teething medicine that contained a toxic coolant In July 24 children in Bangladesh died from the consumption of poisonous acetaminophen syrup The Dorgan amendment does not require imported drugs to be FDA approved or meet FDA misbranding standards Furthermore it does not prevent criminals in other countries from repackaging imported drugs Although our safety system is not perfect we have a thorough FDA review system for drug safety that actively involves physicians pharmacists and patients As a result Americans can be generally confident that our medications are safe and contain the ingredients on the bottle Supporters of reimportation argue that the sick and elderly need an alternative way to obtain affordable drugs However a study by the London School of Economics found that in the European Union middlemen reaped most of the profits with relatively little savings passed down to the consumer Nothing in the Dorgan amendment requires the savings to be passed on to the consumer leaving the door wide open for unscrupulous profitseeking third parties to get into the reimportation game In the United States we are already trying to reduce the cost of prescription drugs through the use of generics This is one of the most effective ways for customers to reap savings and the generic dispensing rate at retail pharmacies is close to 65 percent The FDA is already working with stakeholders to develop drug reimportation policy With the FDA looking into this and significant outstanding safety concerns I cannot in good conscience support the amendment offered by my colleague from North Dakota Instead I will support the amendment offered by my colleague from New Jersey The Lautenberg amendment will allow the importation of drugs only if the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies that doing so would save money for Americans and would not adversely affect the safety of our drug supply While it is critical that all Americans especially our Nations seniors have access to affordable drugs it is imperative that we not compromise the safety of US drugs on the market After all what good are cheap drugs if they are toxic or ineffective Thank you Mr President I yield the floor 
S_NV_ENSIGN,2009-12-02,2001_2009; 2001_2009; 2001_2009; 2001_2009,0135; 0136; 0137; 0134, I wish to make some general comments about it First following the comments of my colleague from Illinois he said there are not 12 trillion in Medicare cuts According to the Congressional Budget Office there are 464 billion to 465 billion in Medicare cuts So maybe not quite 12 trillion but we are certainly getting close There are however 12 trillion in new taxes in this bill 84 percent of which will be paid by those making less than 200000 a year a direct violation of the campaign pledge made by President Barack Obama thenCandidate Obama This bill will result in increased premiums and health care costs for millions of Americans This is a massive government takeover of our health care system As a matter of fact according to the National Center for Policy Analysis in this 2074 page billthere are almost 1700 1697 to be exactreferences to the Secretary of Health and Human Services giving her the authority to create determine or define things relating to health care policy in this bill Basically we are placing a bureaucrat in charge of health care policy instead of the patient and the doctor making the choices in health care I believe we cannot just be against this bill What I do believe in is a stepbystep approach an incremental approach some good ideas on which we should be able to come together I think both sides agree we should eliminate preexisting conditions Somebody who played by the rules had insurance happened to get a disease they should not be penalized charged outrageous prices or have their insurance dropped I think we can all agree on that We should be able to agree that if you can buy auto insurance across State lines you should be able to buy health insurance in the State where it is the cheapest Individuals should be able to find a State that has a policy that fits them and their family and be able to buy it there If you can save money and you happen to be uninsured especially today it seems to make sense Lets have that as one of our incremental steps I also believe this bill covers some of it but I believe we need to incentivize people to engage in healthier behaviors Seventyfive percent of all health care costs are caused by peoples behaviors Let me repeat that Threequarters of all health care costs are driven by peoples poor choices in their behavior For instance smoking On average it is around 1400 a year to insure a smoker versus a nonsmoker For somebody who is obese versus somebody with the proper body weight it is about the same 1400 a year For somebody who does not control their cholesterol versus somebody on regulating medication it is several hundred dollars a year For somebody who does not control their blood pressure versus somebody who doeslets give incentives through lower premiums to encourage people to engage in healthier behaviors That will save money for the entire health care system and our Country will have healthier people with better quality lives Currently big businesses because of their number of employees are allowed to take advantage of purchasing power We ought to allow individuals and small businesses to join together in groups to take advantage of that purchasing power They are called small business health plans I believe my colleagues are going to talk about an idea they have something I talked about for years the idea of medical liability reform There are several models out there They are going to talk about a loser pays model which other countries have engaged in and they do not have nearly the frivolous lawsuits nor the defensive medicine we practice in this country How many doctors order unnecessary tests in the United States because of fear of frivolous lawsuits Talk to any doctor and they will tell you every one of them orders unnecessary tests simply to protect themselves against the possibility that a jury may say Gee why didnt you order this test even though it was not indicated at the time That accounts for a large amount of medical costs As a matter of fact the Congressional Budget Office said 100 billion between the private and public sector would be saved with a good medical liability reform bill I believe we need a patientcentered health care system not an insurance companycentered health care system not what this bill does a governmentcentered health care system where bureaucrats are in control of your health care We need a patientcentered system Before us we have the Mikulski amendment This is more of government centered health care There is a report out based on prevention that indicates that mammograms should not be paid for basically for women under 50 years of age from 40 to 50 years of age and women in the Medicare population age the report indicates that they do not need annual mammograms This was based mainly on cost If you look at it from a cost standpoint that is probably correct But think about it If you are a woman and you get cancer and you could have had a mammogram diagnose it a lot earlier you sure would rather have had that mammogram rather than have that mammogram denied The Senator from Maryland has proposed an amendment to try to fix the problem The problem is instead of one government entity determining whether somebody is going to get coverage the amendment turns it over to the Secretary of Health and Human Services Another government bureaucrat will determine whether something such as a mammogram will be paid for According to the Associated Press her amendment does not even mention mammograms Senator Murkowski and Senator Coburn have come up with an alternative that actually puts the decision of whether to cover preventive services in the hands of experts in the field Whether it be a mammogram for breast cancer or an MRI which most people think is going to be better than a mammogram for diagnosing breast cancer or whether it is a test for prostate cancer for men Those kinds of things should be determined by experts in the field not by government bureaucrats The various collegesthe American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology for instance has come out with certain recommendations along with the American College of Surgeons Those are the experts with peerreviewed science Those are the individuals who should determine what the recommendations are as to whether we pay for preventive services not government bureaucrats Unfortunately the Mikulski amendment just gives that determination to a government bureaucrat That is why we should reject the Mikulski amendment and adopt the amendment offered by the Senator from Alaska the Murkowski amendment puts the decision making in the hands of the of the experts where that decision should be made Let me close with this point We have seen a lot of comparisons where are people saying that other countries have a better health care system than the United States Let me give you the example of cancer survival rates This chart compares the average cancer survival rates in the European Union and the United States it makes the point as to whether a government bureaucrat is making a health decision or the doctor and the patient are making the health treatment decision For kidney cancer the European Union has a 56 percent 5 year survival rate the United States 63 percent survival rate after 5 years On colorectal cancer about the same difference between the United States and the European Union Look at breast cancer 79 percent after 5 years in the European Union 90 percent in the United States The most dramatic difference is on prostate cancer 78 percent survival after 5 years in the European Union 99 percent survival rate in the United States These are dramatic differences Where would you rather get your health care if you had one of these cancers The United States or Europe Canada has even worse results than this As a matter of fact Belinda Stronach a member of the Canadian Parliament led the charge against a private system side by side with the governmentrun system in Canada She did not want the private system Tragically a couple years later she developed breast cancer Did she stay in Canada to get treatment where there is a governmentrun health care system No Where did she go She came to the United States She was actually treated at UCLA Why because we have a superior system of quality in the United States We have a problem with cost Some of the incremental steps I talked about will address costs I wish to turn it over now to my colleagues who are going to talk about medical liability reform Lets look out for the patient instead of the trial lawyers in the United States Their idea on a loser pays system I think has a lot of merit and it is something this body should consider very seriously I yield the floor to the Senator from Georgia my good friend and colleague President I ask unanimous consent that I and my two colleagues be able to engage in a colloquy President I would like to start by talking about the bill in general

0840; 0841; 0843; 0844, I say at this point in time we have three or four amendments before the Senate on health care reform We started the debate on Monday We are now wrapping up Wednesday We are about to go into the 4th day of the debate on one of the most important bills in the history of the US Senate and we have yet to reach an agreement with the Republican side of the aisle to have the amendments voted on If we are only doing four amendments or three amendments in 4 days this is not going to be the kind of debate the American people expected They expected us to bring issues before the floor here debate them with a reasonable period of time and then vote and move to another issue Certainly there are a lot of things to talk about So I hope the Republican side of the aisle will have a change of heart and will start to join us in this dialog will offer their amendments in a timely fashionwe will give them their opportunity to debate themand then bring them to a vote But the fact is we have not had a single vote this week on health care reform amendments because of objections from the other side That is not in the interest of moving forward this important legislation and giving Members an opportunity to present their amendments and have them voted on in a timely fashion Mr President I yield the floor President I ask unanimous consent that after any leader time on Thursday December 3 and the Senate resumes consideration of HR 3590 it be in order for any of the majority or Republican bill managers to be recognized for a total period of time not to extend beyond 10 minutes equally divided and controlled that the time until 1145 am be for debate with respect to the Mikulski amendment No 2791 and the MCCain motion to commit and during this time it be in order for Senator Murkowski to call up her amendment with respect to mammography a copy of which is at the desk and that it also be in order for Senator Bennet of Colorado to call up amendment No 2826 a sidebyside amendment with respect to the MCCain motion to commit that no other amendments or motions to commit be in order during the pendency of these amendments and motion that at 1145 am the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Mikulski amendment No 2791 that upon disposition of the Mikulski amendment the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the Murkowski amendment that upon disposition of these two amendments the Senate continue to debate until 245 pm the Bennet of Colorado amendment No 2826 and the MCCain motion to commit with the time equally divided and controlled between Senators Baucus and MCCain or their designees that at 245 pm the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Bennet of Colorado amendment No 2826 that upon disposition of that amendment the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the MCCain motion to commit that prior to the second vote in each sequence there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form that each of the above referenced amendments or motion be subject to an affirmative 60vote threshold and that if the amendments or motion do not achieve that threshold then they be withdrawn further that if any of the above listed achieve the 60vote threshold then the amendment or motion be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table further that it be in order if there is a request for the yeas and nays to be ordered with respect to that amendment or motion regardless of achieving the 60vote threshold that if the yeas and nays are ordered the vote would occur immediately with no further debate in order with respect to this particular consent I say to the Senator from Connecticut could we characterize this as an earmark in the Medicare Advantage Program Will the Senator yield for a question It is interesting to me that under the MCCain amendment the first line in the amendmentthe motion to commitrelates to Medicare Advantage I used to work for an old fellow in Illinois politics named Cecil Partee and Cecil said For every issue in politics there is a good reason and a real reason We hear a lot of good reasons on the floor for this MCCain amendment and the future of Medicare The real reason is on the first line of Senator MCCains motion to commit He says Send this back to committee and dont touch Medicare Advantage I want to ask the Senator from Connecticut about Medicare Advantage because some of the things I have read around the country about Medicare Advantage tell me this plan run by private health insurance companies costs more than basic Medicare These companies promised us when they got involved they would show us how to run a health insurance plan They would show us how to provide Medicare benefits and they would save us money Some have But by and large if I am not mistaken isnt the verdict ina 14percent increase in cost for Medicare benefits under this Medicare Advantage When we talk about saving over 100 billion in the Medicare Program over the 10 years part of it is by saying to those private health insurance companies that are overcharging Medicare recipients the party is over The subsidy is over We are going to make sure that every American who qualifies for Medicare gets the basic benefits but we will not allow these private health insurance companies to get a subsidy from the Federal Government at the expense of Medicare and its recipients So the motive behind the MCCain amendment is less about saving Medicare and more about saving a private health insurance program called Medicare Advantage Madam President it seems I am following the Senator from Iowa every day I first wish to acknowledge my friendship and respect for him But the Medicare Advantage Program which the Republican side is trying to protect is a program which is private health insurance The largest political opponent to health care reform in America is the private health insurance industry We estimate they have spent 23 million so far lobbying to defeat this bill because they are doing very well under the current system They are very profitable companies and they realize if they face competition limitations on the way they do business it will cut into their bottom line and their profits and naturally are fighting the bill The amendment before us the motion to commit by Senator MCCainthe first thing it does is to protect the Medicare Advantage Program That is a private health insurance program that was created with the promise that it would be cheaper than traditional governmentrun Medicare In some cases they have offered a cheaper policy But overall these private health insurance companies are charging the Medicare Program 14 percent more than the actual cost of the governmentrun system The promise that the private sector could do it more cheaply and better turned out not to be true So we are paying a subsidy in profitsextra profitsto private health insurance companies The MCCain amendment which has been supported by Senator Grassley and others who have come to the floor is an effort to stop us from eliminating this subsidy What is this subsidy worth This subsidy to private health insurance companies will cost the Medicare Program 170 billion over the next 10 yearsno small amount We believe that money is better spent on extending benefits to Medicare beneficiaries not in providing additional profits to already profitable private health insurance companies Yes Medicare Advantage policies are offering Medicare benefits but they are charging more for it than the government So it did not turn out to be a bargain It turned out to be a loss to the Medicare Program They did not do what they promised to do We want to hold them accountable The MCCain amendment wants to let them off the hook and basically say Private health insurance companies keep drawing that money out of Medicare We are not going to hold you accountable That earmark of the Medicare Advantage Program that decision by Congress to give them a special privilege in selling this health insurance is too darn expensive for senior citizens and people who rely on Medicare That is why we are opposing the MCCain amendment I might add this is the third day of the debate on health care reform in America We have yet to vote on a single amendment because the Republicans refuse to allow us to bring an amendment to the floor for a vote How can you have an honest debate about a bill of this seriousness and magnitude if you cannot bring a measure to a vote on the floor Those who follow the Senate know it is a peculiar institution and its rules protect minorities and individual Senators can object to a vote The Republican Senators have objected to a vote even on the MCCain amendment which I believe was filed on Monday and here we are on Wednesday We have talked about it We know what is in it We should vote on it But the Republicans do not want to vote on it They want to drag this out in the hopes that our desire to go home for Christmas means we will walk away from health care reform Well if a few of the Republican Senators could have just left the Democratic caucus they would know better We are determined to bring this bill to a vote We are determined to bring real health care reform to this country We know what is at stake The current health care system in America is not affordable for most Americans Health insurance premiums have gone up dramatically in cost Individuals cannot afford to buy a policy Businesses are dropping coverage of their employees We know the costs are unsustainable Unless we start bringing those costs down this great health care system is going to collapse We need to preserve the things that are good in this system and fix those that are broken Affordability is the first thing we need to address The second thing we need to address quite obviously is to make sure every American has the right as a consumer to get coverage when they need it How many times have you heard the story of people who pay their health insurance premiums their whole lives then somebody gets sick in their housea new baby a child your wife your husbanda big medical bill is coming you go to the health insurance company and you are in for a battle They will not pay it They say Oh we took a look at your application you filed a few years ago You failed to disclose that you had acne when you were an adolescent Am I making that up No That is an actual case Because you did not disclose that you had acne as an adolescent you failed to disclose a preexisting condition so we have no obligation to pay for anything If this sounds farfetched believe me it is an actual caseand there are many others like it Private insurance companies have spent a fortune hiring an army of people sitting in front of computer screens talking to the people who are paying the premiums and above their computers is a sign that says Just Say No They say no consistently because every time they say no their profits go up But it leaves individuals and families in a terrible situationdenied coverage because of a preexisting condition denied coverage because they could not carry their health insurance policy with them after they lost their job denied coverage because of a cap in the amount of money the policy would pay rescinded where they walk away from an insurance policy because of some objection they have legal objection or how about one of your kids who turned age 24 no longer covered by your family health plan now out on their own maybe fresh from college and has no job and no health insurance This bill addresses those issues This bill eliminates the concern people will have over a preexisting condition It takes away the power of the health insurance companies to say no It finally creates a situation which we have waited for for a long time America is the only civilized industrialized country in the world where a person can die for lack of health insurance It does not happen anywhere else only in America Madam President 45000 people a year die for lack of health insurance Who are these people Let me give you an example one person whom I met Her name is Judie and she works in a motel in southern Illinois She is 60 years old a delightful happy woman She is the one who takes the dishes at the end of this little breakfast they offer at the motel She could not be happier and nicer She is 60 years old with diabetes She never had health insurance in her lifenever She goes to work every day works 30 hours a week and makes about 12000 a year She does not have health insurance but she does have diabetes She said to me If I had health insurance I would go to the doctor I have had some lumps that have concerned me for a little while here but I cant afford it Senator That is an example of a person who does not have the benefit of health insurance This bill we are talking aboutthis bill we are going to produce for everyone to read on the Internet it is already there it has been there for 10 days already it will continue to be therethis bill makes sure that 94 percent of the people in America have health insurance coverage That is an alltime high for the United States of America I might also say despite the criticismsand they are entitled to be critical on the Republican side of the aislethey have yet to answer the most basic criticism I have offered Where is your bill Where is the Republican health care reform bill They cannot answer that question because it does not exist They have had a year to explore their ideas and develop them but they have failed They cannot produce a bill They are for the current system as it exists that is unsustainable unaffordable leaving too many Americans vulnerable to health insurance companies that say no and too many Americans without health insurance I wish to address one particular issue that seems to come up all the time and it is the issue of medical malpractice I know my Republican colleagues are going to bring up that issue Senator MCCain has many others have as well President Obama recently recognized this as an issue of concern Our bill will as well We are going to explore encourage and fund State efforts to find ways to reduce medical malpractice premiums and to reduce even more importantly the incidence of medical errors Medical malpractice reform proposals are based in States The Federal Government does not have a medical malpractice law not in general terms It does for specific programs such as Indian health care for example or federally qualified clinics But when it comes to the general practice of medicine that is governed by State laws and the States decide when you can sue what you can sue for and the procedures you have to follow In almost every State there has been a system that has developed over the years to handle these cases States regularly change and update their laws The States try to strike a balance to protect patients preserve their hospitals and doctors and other medical providers ensure that those who are injured have a chance for compensation and manage the cost of their system At least twentyeight States as of last year have decided to impose caps on noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases A long time ago before I came to Congress I used to be a practicing lawyer in Springfield IL and I handled medical malpractice cases So I do not profess to be an expert nor even have current knowledge of medical malpractice but I did in a previous life have some experience I defended doctors when they were sued for a number of years on behalf of insurance companies and I represented plaintiffs who were victims of medical negligence So I have been on both sides of the table I have been in the courtroom I have gone through the process Here is what it comes down to If you are a victim of medical malpractice medical negligence the jury can give you an award which usually includes a number of possibilities pay your medical bills pay for any lost wages pay for any additional expenses that may be associated with the court case and pay for pain and suffering Those are the basic elements that are involved in a medical malpractice lawsuit The pain and suffering part of itit is pain suffering loss of a spouse or child loss of fertility scars and disfigurementis an area where many States have said We want to limit the amount you can recover for pain and suffering what they call noneconomic losses It is not medical bills It is not lost wages So my State for example has a limitation of 500000 on noneconomic damages in a medical malpractice case recently enacted by our general assembly In the State of Texas it is 250000 Those are socalled caps limitations on the amount of money a jury can award for pain and suffering when they find in fact you were a victim of medical negligence Some States have decided to establish caps on pain and suffering how much you can recover others have not The reason many imposed caps was because they wanted to bring down the cost of medical malpractice insurance for doctors and hospitals Well a number of States have done that At least twentyeight States have done that and we have been able to step back and take a look How did it work If you put a cap a limitation on recovery for pain and suffering noneconomic loss does that mean there will be lower malpractice premiums for doctors In some cases yes in some cases no Minnesota is an interesting example Minnesota does not have caps on damages Yet it has some of the lowest malpractice premiums in America Twentyfive States including Minnesota use a certificate of merit system which means before you can file a lawsuit you need a medical professional to sign an affidavit that you have a legitimate claim before you even get into the court That is in Minnesota it is in Illinois and a number of other States to stop socalled frivolous lawsuits Some States such as Vermont have low malpractice premiums and dont have any malpractice reforms It is hard to track cause and effect here between tort reform malpractice changes and the actual premiums charged physicians There are ways Congress can help States build on what already works for each State Senator Baucus who is here on the floor and who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee has worked with Senator Enzi to create incentives for State programs to look for innovative ways to reduce malpractice premiums and the incidence of medical negligence I think that is a good idea and I hope it will ultimately be included in this bill One of the major considerations when it comes to malpractice reform is making sure we focus on real facts One myth we hear over and over again is about frivolous lawsuits flooding the courts I have heard many colleagues come to the floor and call it jackpot justice frivolous lawsuits flybynight lawyers filing medical malpractice lawsuits I am sure there is anecdotal evidence for each and every statement but when you look at the record you find that malpractice claims and lawsuit payouts are actually decreasing in America In 2008 according to the Kaiser Family Foundation there were 11025 paid medical malpractice claims against physicians nationwide One year in America the total number of medical malpractice claims paid according to the Kaiser Family Foundation was 11025 There are 990000 doctors in America so roughly 1 percent of doctors is being charged with malpractice and paying each year This is a decrease from 2007 where the number was 11478 So the number of malpractice claims has gone down The number of paid claims for every 1000 physicians has decreased from 252 in 1991 to 111 in 2008 That is a little over 1 percent of doctors actually paying malpractice claims Not only is the number of claims decreasing but the amount they are paying to victims is decreasing as well The National Association of Insurance Commissionersnot a group that is biased one way or the other when it comes to plaintiffs or defendantssaid in 2003 malpractice claim payouts peaked at 846 billion In 2008 that number had been cut in half In 5 years it went down from 84 billion to 4 billion So rather than a flood of frivolous lawsuits fewer lawsuits are being filed and dramatically less money is being paid out Incidentally the New York Times in a summary of research in September of this year found that only 2 to 3 percent of medical negligence incidents actually lead to malpractice claims So it is not credible to argue that we have this flood of malpractice casesthey are going downor this flood of payouts for malpractice in America It has been cut in half in 5 years A third key consideration in this debate is cost One of the main goals of pursuing health care reform is to try to reduce the cost to the system and we want to try to do that in a way that wont compromise the quality of care There has been a lot of talk about the Congressional Budget Office report that was ordered up by Senator Hatch on October 9 The Congressional Budget Office for years said they could not put a pricetag on medical malpractice reform in terms of savings to the system but on October 9 they reported to Senator Hatch that they could Senator Hatch asked them what would be the impact on our health care system if we had a Texasstyle cap which is 250000 for pain and sufferingI see the Senator from Texas on the floor and I hope I am quoting the Texas law correctly He was a former Texas supreme court justice Am I close That is all I will get from the Senator from Texas close But the fact is that Senator Hatch said to the CBO what if we had the Texasstyle cap on every State in the Union what would be the net result They came back and said there would be a savings of over 50 billion over the next 10 years They said 40 percent of the savings would come from lower medical liability premiums 60 percent through reduced utilization of health care services I dont question the Congressional Budget Office reaching that conclusion They worked hard to come up with their figures But there are other ways to reach results they want to achieve of lowering medical liability premiums and saving overall health care expenditures rather than adopting Federal damage caps Keep in mind these caps on what you can recover are for people who have been judged by a jury of their peers to have been victims These are not people who have said I think I was hurt We are talking about people who have a right to recovery in a lawsuit who are being told even though you were hurt and somebody did something wrong we are going to limit how much you can be paid when it comes to these noneconomic losses The CBO analysis that Senator Hatch received went on to say Because medical malpractice laws exist to allow patients to sue for damages that result from negligent health care imposing limits on that right might be expected to have a negative impact on health outcomes They cited one study which found that a 10percent reduction in costs related to medical malpractice liability would increase the Nations overall death rate by 2 percent By calculation that means that if the Hatch proposal were applied nationwide according to the CBOand this is a cited study4853 more Americans would be killed each year by medical malpracticeor more than 48000 Americans over a 10year period of time that the CBO examines So if you accept their projection on the savings for medical malpractice reform asked for by Senator Hatch you cannot escape the fact that they say yes you will save money but more Americans will die because there will be more malpractice Lets look at the savings that can be achieved through reduced malpractice insurance premiums The CBO said a 250000 Federal damage cap would reduce overall malpractice premiums by about 10 percent and would reduce overall health care spending by 2 percent Do we need a federally mandated cap to achieve that Malpractice insurance premiums are already going down According to the Medical Liability Monitors comprehensive survey of premiums in the areas of internal medicine general surgery and OBGYN The most recent three years have shown a leveling and now a reduction in the overall average rate change for medical malpractice premiums There was a time in the early 2000s where malpractice premiums were going up 20 percent a year in 2003 2004 and 9 percent in 2005 Since then they have gone down each year by less than 1 percent in 2006 by 4 percentI am sorry 4 percent increase in 2007 but a 43 percent decrease in 2008 That is without any Federal cap on damages Lets also consider the issue of defensive medicine Many people claim that doctors do things such as order tests to cover themselves because they are afraid of being sued I agree that there are undoubtedly some doctors who think that way There was a famous article printed in the New Yorker where a surgeon from Boston Dr Gawande who went to MCAllen TXyou probably saw this Senator Cornynand he wanted to know in this article why in MCAllen TX they were paying more for Medicare patients than any other place in the United States So he visited with doctors and surgeons and hospital administrators to ask them why What is peculiar about that city and its elderly people He sat down with the doctors and the first doctor said Well it is defensive medicine We are doing all of these extra tests and extra costs to Medicare to cover ourselves to protect ourselves The doctor sitting next to him said Oh come on With the Texas law nobody is filing malpractice lawsuits around here We are doing these extra procedures because it is a feeforservice system You are paid more when you do more So at least in this case there was a dispute as to whether this was truly defensive medicine or overbilling Dr Carolyn Clancy the director for the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality in the Department of HHS has called medical errors a national problem of epidemic proportions According to that agency the rate of adverse events has risen about 1 percent in each of the past 6 years The Institute of Medicine estimated in 1999 that up to 98000 people died in America due to preventable medical errors These medical errors cost a lot A 2003 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found the medical errors in US hospitals in the year 2000just 1 yearled to approximately 32600 deaths 24 million extra days of patient hospitalization and an additional cost of 93 billion I wish to also say a word about the medical malpractice insurers Remember insurance companies and organized baseball are the only two businesses in America exempt from the antitrust laws What it means is that insurance companies can literally legally sit down and collude and conspire when it comes to the prices they charge and they do They have official organizationsone used to be known as the Insurance Services Officesthat would sit down to make sure every insurance company knew what the other insurance company was charging and they could literally work out the premiums how much they charge The same thing was true in market allocation Insurance companies unlike any other business in America can pick and choose where they will do business Company X you take St Louis company Y you take Chicago company Z you get Columbus OH They can do it legally So the obvious question is If this is not on the square in terms of real competition from health insurance companies are these companies in fact paying out the kind of money they should Let me see if I can find a chart here My staff was kind enough to bring these out Well I cant They are great charts but I cant find the one I am looking for at this moment According to the information of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2008 medical malpractice insurers charged 114 billion in premiums but only paid out 41 billion in losses In other words they took in 7 billion more than they paid out in losses That is a loss ratio of 36 percent which means they are basically collecting 3 for every 1 they pay outpretty close How does that compare to the rest of the insurance industry Well it turns out that private automobile liability insurance had a loss ratio of 66 percent a payout of 2 out of every 3 homeowners 72 percent workers comp insurance 65 percent These medical malpractice insurance companies are holding back premiums and not paying them out It reached a point in my State where our insurance commissioner ordered that they declare a dividend and pay back some of the premiums they had collected from doctors and hospitals when it came to malpractice insurance But rather than get lost in statistics as important as they are I think it is important that we also talk about the real life stories that are involved in medical malpractice I hear these terms such as frivolous lawsuits and jackpot justice and people taking advantage of the system but lets not forget the real life stories that lie behind medical malpractice Let me show my colleagues a picture here of a couple This is Molly Akers of New Lenox IL a lovely young lady with her husband Molly Akers had a swelling in her breast and went to her doctor who performed a biopsy that showed she had breast cancer Molly had several mammograms which found no evidence of a tumor but the doctors decided that despite the mammograms she must have a rare form of breast cancer They recommended a mastectomy removing Molly Akers right breast After the operation the doctor called her into the office and said that on further review she never actually had breast cancer The radiologist had made a mistake He reviewed her slides and accidentally switched Mollys slides with someone else Molly was permanently disfigured by an unnecessary surgery She said afterwards I never thought something like this could happen to me but I know now that medical malpractice can ruin your life By the way that other woman whose slides were switched with Mollys was told she was cancer free What a horrific medical error that turned out to be This next picture is of Glenn Steinberg of Chicago He went into surgery for the removal of a tumor in his abdomen Ten days after the surgery while still in the hospital Glenn was having severe gastrointestinal problems The doctors xrayed his abdomen where the original surgery took place and they found a 4inch metal retractor from the surgery lodged against his intestine A second surgery was performed to remove the metal piece during which Glenns lungs aspirated and he died later that night Glenns wife Mary Steinberg lost her husband She said Not a day goes by that I dont miss Glenns companionship and the joy he brought to our household Because of gross negligence he was not here to support me when my son went off to serve our country in Iraq In this photo is a group of kids including Martin Hartnett of Chicago When Martins mom Donna arrived at the hospital to deliver her labor wasnt progressing Her doctor broke her water and found out that it was abnormal Rather than considering a Csection Donnas doctor started to administer a drug to induce contractions Six hours later she still hadnt delivered but her sons fetal monitoring system began indicating that he was in severe respiratory distress The doctor finally decided it was time to perform an emergency Csection but it was another hour before Donna was taken into the operating room During that time the doctor failed to administer oxygen or take immediate steps to help Martin breathe After he was born Martin was in the intensive care unit for 3 weeks Later Donna learned that Martin had substantial brain damage and cerebral palsya direct result of the doctors failure to respond to indications of serious oxygen deprivation and delivery in a timely manner Donnas doctor told her not to have any more children because there was a serious problem with her DNA which could result in similar disabilities in any of her future kids Since then Donna has given birth to three perfectly healthy sons Donna sued the doctor responsible for Martins delivery and received a settlement She is thankful she has money from the settlement to help cover the costs associated with Martins care that arent covered by health insurance such as the wheelchairaccessible van that she bought for 50000 and the 100000 she spent making changes to her home so her son can get around the house in a wheelchair What would Donna have done without the money from that settlement It is a scary thought because Martin is going to require a lifetime of care When we put caps on recoveries and say there is an absolute limit to how much someone who has created a problem has to pay out we have to think about it in terms of reallife stories such as Martins Martin will live for a long time and he is going to need help Somebody needs to be responsible for that The person who caused this should be responsible for it That is pretty basic justice in America When you establish an artificial cap on noneconomic losses for pain and suffering then you are saying there is a limit to how much can be paid I recall the case of a woman in Chicago who went into a prominent hospitalone that I have a great deal of respect forto have a mole removed from her facea very simple mole removal They gave her a general anesthesia In the course of that anesthesia they gave her oxygen The oxygen tankin the administration of itcaught fire literally burning off her face She went through repeated reconstructive surgeries I have met her There was scarring and as you can imagine a lot of pain Was 250000 too much money for that for what she went through Her life will never be the same That is the kind of disfigurement covered by noneconomic losses that would be limited by medical malpractice caps There are better ways to do this We can in fact reduce the cost of medical malpractice insurance We can in fact reduce medical errors We should not do it at the expense of innocent victimspeople who went in with all the trust in the world to doctors and hospitals and had unfortunate and tragic results Every time I get up to speak on this subject I always make a point of sayingand I will todayhow much I respect the medical profession in America There isnt one of us in this Chamber or anyone watching this who cant point to men and women in the practice of medicine who are true heroes in their everyday lives who sacrifice greatly to become doctors and who work night and day to get the best results for their patients They richly deserve not only our praise but our respect But there are those who make mistakesserious mistakes There are innocent victims who end up with their lives changed or lost because of it We cannot forget them in the course of this debate This is about more than dollars and cents It is about justice in this country I urge my colleagues when the issue of medical malpractice comes before us to remember the doctors but not to forget the victims and their families I yield the floor Can the Senator give us an indication of how long he expects the colloquy to last President will the Senator from Nevada yield for a question before he starts Could the Chair inform me how much time was used on the Republican side during the last group of speakers I am going to proceed to speak in the same manner and yield to the Senator from Vermont Our time will be less than that in total I see the Senator from Louisiana is here We are going to be speaking less than 42 minutes We guarantee him that much We will follow the same process if there is no objection that was just followed with three Republican speakers who spoke in that 42minute period of time I ask unanimous consent that Senator Sanders be recognized after me to speak and that our total time be no more than 42 minutes President I just offered that to the Republican side and they asked me for permission and I gave permission unanimous consent We will speak as long as we like We will enter into a colloquy I hope the Senator from Louisiana will reconsider Let me try to address a few of the issues that have been raised on the Senate floor First on the issue of medical malpractice this is an issue often brought up on the other side of the aisle The first thing I would like to say is this is the bill we are debating It is 2074 pages and one extra page makes it 2075 pages It has taken us a year to put this together There have been a series of committee hearings that have led to the creation of this legislation It has been posted on the Web site for anyone interested If they go to Google for example and put in Senate Democrats they will be led to a Web site which will let them read every word of this bill It has now been out there for 12 days at least and it will continue to be there for review by anyone interested If you then Google Senate Republicans and go to their Web site on health care and look for the Senate Republican health care reform bill you will findthis bill the Democratic bill because there is no Senate Republican health care bill For a year and with an enormous number of speeches they have come to the floor and talked about health care but have never sat down and prepared a bill to deal with the health care system which leads us to several conclusions This is hard work and they have not engaged in that hard work It is easier to be critical of this work product They have chosen that route That is their right to do This is the Senate We are the majority party We are trying to move through a bill But all of the ideas they have talked about tonight and other evenings have not resulted in a bill Second it may be that they do not want to see a change in the current system they are happy with the health care system as it exists today That is possible In fact I think it drives some of them to the point where they criticize our bill but do not want to change the system because they like it I guess there are some things to like about it There are good hospitals and doctors in America Some people are doing very well with the current system But we also know there are some big problems We know the current system is not affordable We know the cost of health insurance has gone up 131 percent in the last 10 years that 10 years ago a family of four paid about 6000 a year for health insurance Now that is up to 12000 a year We anticipate in 8 years or so it will be up to 24000 a year Roughly 40 percent or more of a persons gross income will be paid in health insurance That is absolutely unsustainable So businesses are unable to offer health insurance as well as individuals are unable to buy health insurance The Republicans have not proposed anything nothing that will make health insurance more affordable This bill addresses that issue They have nothing Second we know there are about 50 million Americans without health insurance These are people who work for businesses that cannot afford to offer a benefits package They are people who are recently unemployed and they are people in such lowincome categories they cannot afford to buy their own health insurance and their children50 million This bill we have before us will give coverage to 94 percent of the people in America the largest percentage of people insured in the history of our country The Republicans have failed to produce a bill that expands coverage for anyone in America Under the Republican approach nothing would be done to help the 50 million uninsured The third issue is one about health insurance companies Everybody has an experience there It is unfortunately not good for most because when you pay premiums all your life and then need the health insurance many times it is not there What we do is give consumers bargaining power and a fighting chance with health insurance That to me is a reasonable approach It eliminates discrimination against people because of a preexisting condition and putting caps on the amount of money that is being paid We extend the coverage for children under family health plans from age 24 to age 26 We do things that give people peace of mind that when they need health insurance for themselves and their family it will be there The Republicans fail to offer anything that deals with health insurance reform That is a fact They have said a lot about Medicare I would like to tell you that tomorrow or soon I will be cosponsoring and Senator Bennet of Colorado will be offering an amendment which could not be clearer on the issue of this bill and the Medicare Program The amendment is so short and brief and direct and understandable I want to read a couple of highlights Nothing in the provisions of or amendments made by this Act shall result in the reduction of guaranteed benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act That is Medicare What Senator Bennet is saying is that people will have their Medicare benefits guaranteed Nothing in this bill will infringe on their Medicare benefits despite everything that has been said The Bennet amendment goes on to say Savings generated for the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act under the provisions of and amendments made by this Act shall extend the solvency of the Medicare trust funds reduce Medicare premiums and other costsharing for beneficiaries and improve or expand guaranteed Medicare benefits and protect access to Medicare providers All of the speeches made in the last 3 days about how this bill threatens Medicareit does notwill be completely cleared up by the Bennet amendment I hope some Republicans who have a newfound love of the Medicare Program which was started many years ago will join us in voting for this amendment It would be great to see if their speeches to save Medicare will result in their votes for the Bennet amendment This is a critically important amendment I commend him for being so straightforward and showing real leadership on an issue of this magnitude I know the Senator from Vermont is interested in speaking I am prepared to yield for comments and questions Before I do I wish to say by way of introduction that we heard one of our Republican colleagues say this is a singlepayer bill that at the end of the day we will have created a singlepayer system I think the Senator from Vermont is familiar with the concept of single payer and I would invite his comments or questions through the Chair to me about his feelings on this issue In response to the Senator from Vermont we must do better This is the only civilized developed industrialized country in the world where a person can literally die because they dont have health insurance Fortyfive thousand people a year die because they dont have health insurance What does that mean One illustration If you had a 5000 copay on your health insurance policyand people face thatand you go to the doctor and the doctor says Durbin we think you need a colonoscopy and I realize I have to pay the first 5000 and the colonoscopy is going to cost 3000 and I say I am going to skip itwhich people do and bad things happenI develop colon cancer and die my insurance has failed me Basic preventive care is not there We are the only civilized developed country where that is a fact A lady I met 2 weeks ago in southern Illinois 60 years old a hostess at a hotel who serves breakfast in the morningthey are there as we travel around our Stateshas never had health insurance in her life is diabetic and told me that her income is so low 12000 a year she could not afford to go to a physician to check out some lumps she had discovered That is the reality of the current health care system in the wealthiest greatest Nation on Earth President I certainly agree with the Senator from Vermont I would add one more statistic Of the nearly 1 million people filing for bankruptcy in America each year because of health care costs medical bills they cant pay threefourths of them have health insurance Threefourths of them were paying premiums These were the people turned down when they needed coverage These were the people who ran into caps on coverage on their policies These are folks who had to battle it out and lost the battle with the insurance companies to try to get lifesaving drugs That is the reality of the current system The fact is the Republican side of the aisle has not produced an alternative We have We have worked long and hard to do it They have not We are sent many books and some of them I have a chance to glance at This is the recent one I received entitled Bend the Health Care Trend They have here information which says American health care spending reached 24 trillion in 2008 and will exceed 4 trillion by 2018 We expect a doubling of basic health insurance premiums in 8 to 10 years and we know what you just described is reality Even businesses owned by a couple a husband and wife are finding themselves not only unable to provide health insurance for their employees because of its cost they cant cover themselves I had a friend of mine one of my boyhood friends I grew up with him and his wife His small business had one of their employees under the health insurance plan and his wife had a baby with a serious illness As a result their premiums went through the roof He had to cancel his group health insurance He had to cancel the insurance he gave to his employees He gave his employees the 300 a month whatever it was they were paying and said We are all on our own now We have to go in the private market The couple with the sick baby couldnt find any health insurance My friend who was in his 60s and his wife are in a pitched battle every year about how much they have to pay for health insurance and the company the only one that will cover them each year excludes whatever they turned a claim in for last year So that is the reality of health insurance for small businesses I also want to tell my friend from Vermont about onethird of all realtors in America are uninsured have no health insurance They are independent contractors and they have no health insurance one out of three I would say to those who call our plan a singlepayer plan what we are trying to do is to get fair treatment from private health insurance companies for consumers and families across America and to give them choices The Senator from Vermont I assume is part of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program So am I Most Members of Congress belong to the program Eight million Federal employees and Members of Congress are part of this program It may be the best health insurance in America And we can shop I just got a notice in the mail that says open enrollment is coming If you dont like the way you were treated by your health insurance plan last year you can change You can pick a new one If it is a generous plan more money will be taken out of your check If it is not less money will be taken out We can shop What we do on the insurance exchanges in this bill is say to these Americans who wouldnt otherwise have options go shopping Find the best health insurance plan for your family Exercise your choice I would say to Senator Harry Reid who drafted this bill I thank him for his hard work He includes a public option a notforprofit health insurance plan with lower costs that people can choose if they care to Giving people that choice giving them an option to go shopping for the most affordable best health insurance plan is what we enjoy as Members of Congress and what every American family should I say to my colleague from Vermont I am waiting for the first Republican Senator to offer an amendment to this bill to abolish Medicare If they really believe that government health insurance is such a bad idea they ought to step right up and show it There is another way that Senators who loathe the idea of governmentrun health insurance plans can show personally their commitment to that idea by coming to the floor and publicly announcing they will not participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program which provides health insurance for Members of Congress I have yet to hear the first Member critical of government health plans come forward and say So in a show of unity and personal commitment I am going to opt out I think you will hear a lot of speeches about socialized medicine socialism and the big reach of government When it comes right down to it there is not a single Member from the other side who stepped up and said Therefore I will offer an amendment to abolish it They will have their chance in this bill and if they want to they can I do not think the people who have this coverage today would like to see it gone Reserving the right to object the staff advises me that they are reaching out to Senator Mikulski at this moment I dont know if we can be in contact with her this evening but I would ask the Senator from Louisiana if he would consider allowing us to go forward with this unanimous consent request and hope we can still modify it tomorrow if there is an agreement with Senator Mikulski at that point I dont think that jeopardizes the right of the Senator from Louisiana to offer this at a later time during the course of this debate Based on that I would continue to object The Senator from Vermont has been a leader on this issue I can recall when President Obama came forward with his stimulus bill the recovery and reinvestment bill that the Senator from Vermont was one of the leaders to put additional funds in the bill to build clinics all across Americain rural areas we represent in the towns and cities we represent as wellfor the very reason the Senator mentioned Because for a lot of people who I represent in downstate southern Illinois in some of the rural regions it is a long drive to a doctors clinic for primary care So these community health clinics FHQA clinics are going to offer people primary care I think as a result of this bill when we enact itand I feel very good about the enactment of this because I think we sense this is a moment in history we should not misswe are going to see this network grow across America And it has proven itself to be so good In the city of Chicago I have visited these community health clinics I will bet the Senator does in Vermont What I find there many times I will walk in the door The administrator will be there We will start talking I will meet the doctors I will meet the nurses When I finally get a chance to drink a cup of coffee and talk to them for a few minutes I sayand I mean itif I were sick I would feel confident walking into the front door of this clinic that I would be in the best of handsbetter than the most expensive clinic in my State I might say the Senator from Vermont has also raised an important issue We know we are going to need more primary care physicians so there are provisions in this bill to encourage young people to pursue primary careinternists family practitioners because those are the frontline people who are needed more frequently for preventive care and basic checkups so people have a chance to see a good doctor before they get sick or become seriously ill and it is much more expensive So we are pushing forward for more and more health care professionals Again the Republican critics of this legislation have offered nothingnothingwhen it comes to encouraging the growth in the number of our health care workers in America This ought to be something that is nonpartisan I would think that at some point they would agree that many things in here are essential for the future of our country I think that is one of them I would say we have some of the best health care in America but also the most expensive health care in America We spend more per person than any other nation on Earth and a lot of it has to do with money not being well spent People who do not have access to a medical home which we establish in this bill people who do not have access to a community health care clinic in desperation will take a baby with a high fever in to an emergency room Once there they will have the most expensive care they could ever face when they could have gone for a doctors appointment That is not good for the hospitals because many of them are giving charity care they do not get compensated for and they pass that cost along to other patients and it certainly is not good for the families involved I am not sure I would support or oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana but this matter has been on the floor now for 3 days I say to the Senator there is a pending amendment here on your side of the aisle from Senator Murkowski on this issue and I would hope that the Senator has approached her to incorporate his language I do not know if the Senator approached Senator Mikulski But at this point we think we have some effort being made at fairness on both sides that there will be Democratic amendments and Republican amendments both offeredMikulski and Murkowski and MCCain and Bennetand so I would object because I believe we have the basis for a fair agreement at this point President reserving the right to object may I suggest to my friend from Louisiana would you consider approaching Senators Mikulski andor Murkowski the first thing tomorrow and see if they are prepared to work with you on this This Mikulski amendment has been pending for 3 days President I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded President I ask unanimous consent that the previous order with respect to HR 3590 be modified to provide that the Vitter amendment No 2808 to the Mikulski amendment No 2791 be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table that the order be further modified to provide that the vote with respect to the Mikulski amendment should now reflect the Mikulski amendment as amended President I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to a period of morning business with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each President I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Agriculture Nutrition and Forestry be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on December 2 2009 at 930 am in room 216 of the Hart Senate Office Building President I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Armed Services be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on Wednesday December 2 2009 at 9 am President I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on December 2 2009 at 10 am in room 253 of the Russell Senate Office Building President I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate to conduct a hearing on December 2 2009 at 10 am in room SD366 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building President I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Environment and Public Works and the Subcommittee on Superfund Toxics and Environmental Health be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on December 2 2009 at 230 pm in Room 406 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building President I ask unanimous consent that the Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on December 2 2009 at 230 pm to conduct a hearing entitled Disaster Case Management Developing a Comprehensive National Program Focused on Outcomes President I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S Res 366 submitted earlier today President I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be

about a very important topic on the floor right now along with the Medicare issue that is preventive screenings and services particularly for women I want to focus on a very specific and important example of that which is breast cancer screening through mammography and also through the practice of selfexamination This is very timely because 2 weeks ago a US governmentendorsed panel issued new recommendations on this topic which I believe along with tens of millions of Americans is a major step in the wrong direction I think we need to focus on this recent action and talk about this and fix it in the context of this health care reform debate What am I talking about Well on Tuesday November 17literally just a couple weeks agothe US Preventive Services Task Force which is an official governmentsanctioned bodya task force about preventive medicineissued new recommendations regarding breast cancer screening for women including the use of mammography These new recommendations they came out with a couple weeks ago are a big step backward a big retrenchment in terms of what the current state of knowledge is and what their previous recommendations were Their new recommendations just out 2 weeks ago do four things that take a big step back on breast cancer screening No 1 for women between the ages of 40 and 49 rather than get a routine mammogram every 2 years to screen for breast cancer the task force said Forget about that We do not recommend that anymore We step back from that recommendation No 2 for women aged 50 to 74 the previous recommendation was to get a routine mammogram to screen against breast cancer every year The task force 2 weeks ago stepped back from that and said No every other year is probably good enough So not every year every other year No 3 for women over the age of 75 the previous recommendation was to have routine screening at least every 2 years The new recommendation from the task force steps back from that and says No we do not recommend routine screening over the age of 75 And No 4 the task force 2 weeks ago said We no longer recommend breast selfexamination by women to detect lumps to get treatment early We do not believe in that We do not think the science is clear on that We step back from that Those are four huge changes in their previous recommendations Those are four huge new recommendations completely at odds with what I believe is the clear consensus in the medical community and the treatment community When I first read about these new US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations around November 17 I had the immediate reaction I just enunciated but I said I am not an expert I am not a doctor I am not a medical expert I want to hear from folks who are much closer to this crucial issue than me So my wife and I convened a roundtable discussion in Baton Rouge LA We had it on Monday November 23 It was at the Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center They were very kind to host it It was cohosted by Womens Hospital in Baton Rouge We had a great roundtable discussion featuring a lot of different people including oncologists other MDs other medical experts and including maybe most importantly several breast cancer survivors who literally lived through this issue themselves Those breast cancer survivors were all women who got breast cancer and had it detected relatively early in their forties So they are exactly the group of people these new recommendations would work against because the new recommendations say dont get regular mammography screening in your forties Again I was interested in hearing from the real experts both medical experts and the survivors what they thought about it I wasnt very surprised quite frankly when they all had exactly the same reaction I did to these new US Preventive Service Task Force recommendations Everybody to a person said this is a big step backward This will make us move in the wrong direction Increased screening early detection is a leading reason we are winning increasingly the fight against breast cancer It is a leading reason we are doing so much better in this fight In that one room at the Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center in a sense we had a snapshot through history and proof of the great gains we have made including through early screening because as I said we had these survivors all a supercause for celebration Folks who had detected their cancer most of them relatively early all of them first got it and detected it either in their forties or some in their thirties Unfortunately in the same room we had a life experience on the other end of the spectrum going back 40plus years That is my wife Wendy who lost her mother to breast cancer when she was 6 years old One of the reasons is simple and straightforward and directly related to what we are talking about Back in the late 1960s when Wendy lost her mom to breast cancer there wasnt this same routine There wasnt this emphasis on screening There wasnt the recommendation for annual mammograms There wasnt the educational push for selfexamination There wasnt that focus and because of that far more women tragically including Wendys mother died We have made huge progress since then Again the very life experiences in that one room in Baton Rouge proved that The medical doctors and the oncologists the other experts as well as the breast cancer survivors all made that point So I am standing on the Senate floor to urge us to take focused specific action to legislatively repeal any impact of these new recommendations by the US Preventive Services Task Force issued in November This topic is on the Senate floor It is on the floor through the Mikulski amendment There is probably going to be a Republican alternative to that Mikulski amendment My concern is in terms of everything on the floor now none of it directly specifically takes back the impact of those new recommendations I think that is the first matter we should all come together on 100 to nothing on this topic We can have a broader debate We can have differences about the best approach to prevention and screening But the first concrete focused thing we should do right now on the Senate floor today is come together 100 to nothing to legislatively overrule any impact of those new recommendations That is again what I have been hearing from experts not just in Baton Rouge not just in that one room but across the country experts in terms of oncologists other medical doctors leaders of the cancer associations across the country and perhaps most importantly breast cancer survivors I daresay that is what every Member of this body has heard from their States since those new recommendations came out around November 17 So again whatever we do in this broader debate I have a very simple basic focused suggestion Lets show the American people we can come together around something on which I believe we all agree There is an expression It is mom and apple pie Well this should be considered mom and apple pie because it is literally about mom and our wives and our daughters and obviously half the population So lets come together around this issue and lets legislatively overrule any legal impact any legal consequence of these new task force recommendations of the US Preventive Service Task Force That is what my Vitter amendment No 2808 does I had hoped the amendments on the Senate floor on this general topic would do that already Unfortunately the one that is pending now at least the Mikulski amendment does not do that In fact in some ways it points to the new recommendations of the task force and holds up those new recommendations Our current law holds up the current recommendations I think because the new recommendations they promulgated around November 17 are so egregious such a bad idea because the consensus around the country starting with experts and oncologists is so clear that we should negate any impact of them So again my Vitter amendment No 2808 which is currently filed as a seconddegree amendment to the Mikulski amendment would do that Let me be perfectly clear and read my text because it is very short For the purposes of this Act and for the purposes of any other provision of law the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Service Task Force regarding breast cancer screening mammography and prevention shall be considered the most current other than those issued in or around November 2009 So what it does is simple It says we are erasing we are canceling out any effect of those new recommendations made by the task force in and around November 2009 We are saying that never happened because the consensus is so clear against it Again I expected the Mikulski amendment to do that directly It doesnt do that It does other things about prevention which is fine We can debate those points We can have a discussion about that But I think we need to all come together to absolutely categorically specifically legislatively take back overrule these new recommendations I am certainly eager to work with everyone in this body starting with Senator Mikulski starting with Senator Murkowski whom I believe may offer a Republican alternative to include this language I hope this language which seems to me is a nobrainer given the consensus on the topic can be included in both of those amendments It should be just accepted and included in the Mikulski amendment It should be accepted and included in the Murkowski amendment That would be my goal so that whatever happens on these votes we come together in a unified way Literally it would in essence be 100 to nothing to say No time out These new recommendations of the US Preventive Services Task Force from November of this year are a huge step backwards a huge mistake That is what the experts are saying That is what oncologists are saying That is what cancer specialists are saying That is what leaders of cancer associations are saying That is what perhaps most importantly breast cancer survivors are saying We can look at history in this country in the last several decades and happily point to real progress in this fight One of the causes of that good news that improvement since the late 1960s when my wife Wendys mom passed away from breast cancer clearly one of the underlying reasons clearly one of the leading causes is dramatic improvement in this prevention and screening using mammography also educating about selfexamination So again I have this seconddegree amendment My hope and my goal would be that this language which should be noncontroversial would be accepted on it as well as any Republican alternative and that whatever happens in terms of those votes we come together and make crystalclear that this task force of unelected bureaucratsdidnt include a single oncologist by the waymade a big mistake and we are going to make sure those new recommendations dont have any impact in terms of law in terms of government programs in terms of legal impact on insurance companies Again I look forward to working with everyone on the floor including Senator Mikulski including Senator Murkowski and others to pass this language It should be a nobrainer It is mom and apple pie Lets pass it and at least in this focused way come together and do the right thing in direct reaction to something that just happened 2 weeks ago Thank you Mr President I yield the floor Mr President I certainly concur with the distinguished majority whips goal of more amendments and more votes With regard to this very important screening and mammography issue my goal has been a very focused one I have a filed seconddegree amendment that has a very simple focused objective which I believe is extremely noncontroversial I believe it would be supported by everyone in this body and that is simply to ensure that there is no legal force and effect to the recent recommendations issued in November of 2009 by the US Preventative Services Task Force with regard to breast cancer screening use of mammography and selfexamination As everyone knows those new recommendations were shocking in that they took a giant step back from the previous recommendations and took a giant step back in terms of recommended screening which virtually every expert I know of strongly disagrees with So this filed simple seconddegree amendment simply says that those new recommendations of November of this year have no force and effect I will read the amendment It is very short To be clear it does nothing more than that For the purposes of this Act and for the purposes of any other provision of law the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Service Task Force regarding breast cancer screening mammography and prevention shall be considered the most current other than those issued in or around November 2009 So we are simply ensuring that those new recommendationswhich I strongly disagree with experts strongly disagree with I believe all of my colleagues dohave no legal force and effect So I would simply ask that the unanimous consent proposed be modified so that the Mikulski amendment incorporates this language I would propose that as an alternative unanimous consent request I am very disappointed about objecting to this important and what should be noncontroversial provision I would suggest another solution which is to take the unanimous consent request on the floor and modify it so there is simply a vote on this seconddegree amendment amendment No 2808 immediately before the vote on the Mikulski amendment President reserving my right to object again I am very disappointed to hear that I have approached both sides Senator Murkowski has incorporated similar language and I was hoping we could come together 100 to nothing to actually pass this on to the bill whichever alternative tomorrow is voted upand maybe they both will bebut whichever is voted up or whichever is voted down I think it is very important to come together and state that we dont want these new task force recommendations to have any force and effect So let me propose a third and final alternative unanimous consent request that at any point after these votes but before cloture is filed on the pending matter this amendment No 2808 receive a vote on the Senate floor as a firstdegree amendment to the underlying bill President if I could President reserving my right to object just so I can respond directly I didnt mean to cut the Senator off If he has any further statement I will be happy to listen to it But just so I can respond directly the first thing today I approached both those Members and everyone involved in this debate about this language and certainly the majority side has had this language for at least 712 hours The equivalent of this language has been incorporated into the Murkowski amendment but my hope is that the same thing be accepted in the Mikulski amendment because it is not clear which is going to be adopted I dont see the great controversy here So that was my hope And that is why I approached those two Senators and the majority side 712 hours ago about it with specific language So I renew my last unanimous consent request I made in that spirit President reserving the right to object merely to respond through the Chair I would say I have been working in that spirit I have given the language to the majority side I have been working both at the staff level and Member level with many folks This should be noncontroversial I dont know of any Senator who disagrees with this So I will accept that offer I will not object to this pending unanimous consent but I truly hope the offer is made in good faith because I believe when anyone reads this language they will agree with it Again it simply says these latest recommendations by the US Preventive Services Task Force made 2 weeks ago will not have any legal force and effect I believe all of uscertainly it is my impression and I guess we will find out tomorrow morningI believe all of us want to stop them from having force and effect because it is a great step backward in terms of breast cancer screening and mammography and even education about selfexamination So I certainly take that offer and look forward to the majority side rereading this language and hopefully accepting it tomorrow morning because I cant imagine on substantive grounds objecting to the language Thank you With that I will not object

the microphone and I thank you for the 16 seconds I would like to nowoh I have used it up I yield my time Madam President let me use the 16 seconds I had but use it in a better way so maybe it wont be 2 minutes I was going to talk about Senator Lincolns amendment to limit tax benefits health insurance companies receive on salaries for CEOs but let me just talk about the nature of this debate My esteemed colleague from Arizona Senator MCCain quoted Ronald Reagan saying facts are stubborn things We just had my distinguished colleague from South Dakota say that this bill does not extend for 1 day the solvency of Medicare Well according to the Office of the Actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services it extends it for 5 years Now facts are either stubborn things or they arent The Actuary for CMS is either the Actuary for CMS or not You cant have a debate such as this and throw things around Facts are stubborn things We are entitled to our own opinions We are not entitled to our own facts You cannot stand up here and wave your arms and say this doesnt extend Medicare 1 minute 1 day when the Actuary for Medicare says the bill extends it for 5 years I yield the floor Madam President I actually was kind of feeling bad because I thought I was going to be changing the subject when Senator Durbin said I would be the next Democrat to speak Because our good colleague from Nevada brought up an amendment on medical malpractice liability and the Senator from Illinois responded to it and I thought the Senator from Nevada was going to respond to his response with some factual information or something he completely changed the subject So he went from the Canadian system to rationing and he will include his entire statement which included this We dont ration care here in the United States we letmeaning the governmentwe let the private sector do that They do a great job of rationing care in the private sector That is where we ration care in this country They ration it by cutting off your insurance when you get sick They ration care by not giving you insurance if you have a preexisting condition I wish to speak about an amendment I havethat is why I was going to change the subjectbut let me talk a little bit about tort reform liability insurance Senator Durbin mentioned Atul Gawande He wrote that article in the New Yorker Senator Ensign talked about how great the tort reform was in Texas MCAllen TX has the most expensive health care in the country What kind of progress is that They have the most draconian medical liability reform In Minnesota we dont have anything such as that We do it for a third of the cost that they do it for in Texas and with better outcomes The reason I actually asked for time today is to express my support for Senator Lincolns amendment to limit the tax benefits that health insurance CEOs receivenot limit their salaries limit the tax benefits This does not limit their compensation as was claimed by the Senator from Nevada Most Americans would agree that the government though shouldnt be giving tax breaks to insurance companies for lining the pockets of their CEOs at the expense of working families who are forced to pay more and more as their premiums spiral out of control The savings from removing this tax deduction in Senator Lincolns amendment will go directly to our seniors as a direct deposit into the Medicare trust fund This amendment is immensely important because it reinforces one of our primary goals with this bill which is to rein in the cost of health care One of the key ways we can control costs is by holding insurance companies accountable I am pleased to be working with Senator Lincoln on another effort to make our health care system focused on patients not profits Yesterday Senator Lincoln joined me Senator Rockefeller and others in introducing an amendment to require that at least 90 percent of your premium dollars go toward actual health services We do that in Minnesota We do that in Minnesota91 cents actually I urge my colleagues to support both our amendments to ensure we get the highest possible value for our premium dollars because nobody can contest the fact that forprofit health insurance companies have been making obscene amounts of money while Americans watch their premiums skyrocket From 2000 to 2007 insurance company profits rose 428 percentin 8 years During that same time we saw more than 6 million more Americans become uninsured During that same period American families saw their premiums almost double So nobody can stand on this floor and argue that American families arent suffering No one can dispute what I hear from Minnesotans every day that in this economic downturn one of the greatest fears families have is What happens if I get sick What happens if my spouse or my child gets sick We are hardly holding on now We are just one illness away from losing everything That is what I hear That is what I hear from Minnesota families and this is a State that has lessexpensive higher quality health care than the rest of the country If Minnesotans are struggling we know we have a crisis on our hands That is why I am working to make sure this bill does everything it can to bring down costs improve quality and hold private insurance companies accountable The current reality is most of us dont know where our health insurance premiums go It is difficult enough to understand a billing statement from your health insurer much less track where your money is spent Well we are going to change that We are going to change that with transparent reporting of how health insurance companies are spending your money That is in this bill Clear reporting written in plain English will help us hold them accountable for every dollar we spend on health insurance But reporting isnt enough because right now some of the health insurance plans being marketed and sold in this country are nothing short of a ripoff A recent report in BusinessWeek magazine described a policy being sold in Florida to college students in which only 10 percent of the premium went toward actual health services Again only 10 cents out of every dollar goes to health care in this plan The rest goes to marketing wasteful administrative costs and of course profits And this is legal It has been legal It was legal when the Republicans had the White House and controlled this Congress We are going to make it illegal I dont think this is what we want for our childreninsurance companies pocketing millions of dollars at the expense of our physical and economic health Is that the kind of country we want to be I believe we can all agree this health care reform bill must guarantee that Americans get value for the premiums we pay I implore my colleagues to support these efforts because health insurance should be about providing the best possible health care not about marketing wasteful administrative costs CEO pay and profits Madam President I yield the floor The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from New Jersey is recognized Madam President I rise today to talk about Shane Bauer Sarah Shourd and Josh Fattal These three young Americans have been in custody in Iran since July 31 2009 That is more than 4 months Shane is from Minnesota where his devoted mother Cindy Hickey still lives I have been in constant and close touch with Cindy over the phone and last month I was able to meet with all the families of the young hikers and they have been back in Washington again this week I have to say they are a remarkable group of people who want nothing more than to be reunited with their children On behalf of their families I have come to the floor today to urge the Government of Iran to make a humanitarian gesture and release these young Americans so they can be together with their families again As many of you know Josh Sarah and Shane were hiking near the IraqiIranian border in a remote region that is famous for a beautiful waterfall when they were taken into custody by Iranian authorities The Iranians have indicated that the Americans strayed across the border in this remote region There can be no doubt that it was an accident Four months later Josh Sarah and Shane remain in prison in Iran The Iranian Government has allowed the Swiss Embassy in its capacity as protection power for US interests in Iran to have consular access to them twice during the time they have been held I hope this will continue and continue more regularly The Swiss have been enormously helpful in working with us to resolve the situation to bring these Americans home I have been assured by one of the Swiss that Josh Sarah and Shane were all in decent physical condition as of the last visit But it is also clear the imprisonment is taking its toll on these young people The President of Iran has indicated that their case will be examined expeditiously and with compassion which is encouraging President Ahmedinejad first made that statement around the time the UN General Assembly met this past September These young American tourists find themselves in unfortunate circumstances One thing is clear These circumstances do and should have nothing to do with politics I hope that Josh Sarah and Shanes situation can be resolved on the same basisas purely a human gesture by the Government of Iran I understand that people on all sides tend to get caught in the middle of geopolitical events they have nothing to do with That is a cycle that can and should be stopped We do not want to perpetuate that cycle Above all I hope the Iranian Government will recognize that these Americans have committed nothing more than an innocent mistake and want nothing more than to be brought back together with their families The Americans should be released In the meantime I hope Josh Sarah and Shane will be able to speak with their families by phone immediately That would be the first direct contact they have had since their detention over 4 months ago As we approach the holiday season and the end of the year this is an especially important time for families to be together That is not an American value or an Iranian value it is a human value It is my fervent hope that Josh Sarah and Shane will be brought back together with their families now I urge the Government of Iran to make a humanitarian gesture and make that family reunion possible 
S_IA_HARKIN,2009-12-05,1985_2009,0133, President I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded President first of all let me say I am glad we are here this weekend Oh I know we like to be with our families we have Christmas shopping to do and things such as that It is always nice to be with our families on the weekends But think about it this way Millions of Americans today are giving up their weekends they are giving up their nights their holidays because they are either out of work they are working part time they are trying to do odd jobs to get enough money together to keep their families intact So they are working at nights they are working on weekends They are not taking time off They are out there looking for work now or out there doing odd jobs whatever they can possibly do They are making sacrifices They are making sacrifices for their families but they are also making these sacrifices to pay their medical bills or to afford their needed prescriptions It seems to me we owe them nothing less than the same level of commitment to the task of bringing quality affordable health care within their reach Our leader Senator Reid was right to call the Senate into session this weekend We ought to keep at this bill this health care reform bill working hard until the Senate finishes the job before us Nothing less will do I do not plan to spend a lot of time on the debate over Medicare Advantage that we had yesterday However after listening to the comments yesterday I did want to mention briefly editorials that appeared in the Des Moines Register The first was published 6 years ago when the Senate considered the Republican Medicare drug legislation The major element of that bill was to give outrageous bonuses to private health plans in Medicare Advantage In criticizing that proposal the Register called on Members of Congress to remind themselves their job is to serve the interests of the people not industry lobbyists Sadly we didnt heed that call that time 6 years ago Instead Congress under Republican leadership at that time enacted a bill that provided a massive and unjustified windfall to the insurance industry The Register revisited the same subject in an editorial this year May 31 of this year Here is what they said Congress encouraged private insurance plans known as Medicare Advantage plans which have cost taxpayers more than covering seniors in traditional governmentadministered Medicare Congress should not repeat the mistakes it made in 2003 when reforming Medicarecatering to special interests and pushing people into privatesector insurance coverage Our health bill the one we have before us heeds these words We stand up to the special interests that even today are demanding billions of dollars in taxpayer funds to prop up their inflated profits So yesterday was a good day Yesterday we said no to giving the insurance industry a 120 billion bonus for doing the same job that Medicare can do for far less Today we will consider a proposal from Senator Lincoln to say no to the outrageous salaries that top executives in these companies receive Chief executive officers at the seven leading insurance companies made a combined 1186 million in 2007 alone an average of 119 million each Lets compare that to the wages of millions of Americans or the minimum wage For someone making the minimum wage it would take nearly 800 years to make what these insurance company executives make in 1 year Again here is the CEO compensation For United Health Group they made 29 billion in profit in 2008 and they paid their CEO 94 million WellPoint 98 million Aetna 243 million Humana 473 million Coventry Health Care 11 million Cigna 44 million That is the CEO compensation That probably is not the whole package when you consider all the other benefits they get deferred compensation and on and ongolden parachutes all that kind of stuff That is basically their CEO compensation for the year As you can see they get paid pretty well and 119 million is the average Here is Aetna 24 million a year They had a profit of 13 billion that year So they did well their shareholders did well their CEO did well But how about the consumers the working families In 2003 by the way Aetna this company right here making all this money paying their CEO 24 million a yearin 2003 Aetna settled a lawsuit You know usually when you settle lawsuits it is because you think you are going to get hit worse down the line They settled a lawsuit brought by who Brought by physicians a whole group of physicians brought a class action against Aetna because they had a history of shortchanging patient care Aetna settled for 470 million just to get away from it in 2003 There was not any money to help them afford the coverage patients need but they had billions for profits and they had millions for salariesnothing for working families The reality for working families across America is simply this Insurance premiums have skyrocketed outpacing the growth in wages over the same period Quality affordable health care is slipping further and further from the grasp of middleclass Americans Between 1999 and 2007 the average American worker saw wages increase 29 percent Insurance premiums during that same time rose more than 120 percent They see the premiums skyrocketing but their health care is slipping away There is something else The profit margins of the insurance industry soared Over the last 7 years the profits of the seven largest publicly traded health insurance companies increased by 428 percent Profits increased by 428 percent from 24 billion to 129 billion Yet look at what our workers wages went up29 percent Now you begin to understand why people in this country are upset and discouraged and outright mad about their lack of health insurance coverage about the affordability of that coverage and the quality of that coverage Yet with all of this money that is going to their CEOs and huge increases in the profits they make our Republican friends on the other side of the aisle say they still need a Federal handout The industry cannot find a dime to bring down prices for consumers but they can find millions to lobby for more special favors The Wall Street Journal reported that the health care industry boosted their efforts in lobbying this year In a quote from the Wall Street Journal Overall the healthcare sector reported a five percent increase in lobbying expenditures to 133 million making it the single largest spender on lobbying of the 10 major industry sectors tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics Healthinsurance companies increased lobbying activity by 11 percent to 78 million according to the data An increase of 11 percent You wonder why all this health sector this year had 133 million in lobbying expenditures I think if I am not mistaken the supposed stated purpose of health insurance is to protect Americans from the cost of illness Supposedly their purpose is to keep the American people healthy and productive for the benefit of society Yet over some 60 years this industry the health insurance industry has transformed itself from an industry that is there to help you to an industry that is there to take money from you when you are healthy and avoid paying your bills when you get sick This is an industry with armies of actuaries and functionaries whose job is to prevent you from enrolling if you have a preexisting condition It is an industry that looks at the fine details of your medical records when you get sick so they can figure out how to cancel your policy and leave you high and dry when you need their help the most as has been said many times around here The majority actually 62 percent of bankruptcies in America is because of medical costs and 80 percent of that group had health insurance They actually had health insurance but they had to file for bankruptcy becausethey didnt know it but in their contract in their policy there was some fine print called a rescission clause or there is fine print in there on terms of their annual or lifetime caps which most people do not even know are in their policies But when they got very sick all of a sudden their policy got rescinded which means when it came up for renewal the insurance company didnt renew it and here you are with an expensive chronic disease or illness such as cancer or heart disease or disability and they cancel your policy You are left with only one recoursefile for bankruptcy This is an industry which defines being a victim of domestic violence as a preexisting condition I spoke about this previously Only in America with this health insurance industry running everything in terms of our health care coverage only here would we have a situation where a woman can be the victim of domestic violence be battered get medical help go to the hospital perhaps a victim of domestic abuse and then later on find that she cant get her policy renewed because she has a preexisting condition the preexisting condition of being the victim of domestic violence You may think that is outlandish but it is true and it happens All we are seeking is competition openness transparency and fairness The insurance industry what are they seeking They are seeking to preserve and protect a sweet deal they have been enjoying on the backs of middleclass Americans and seniors The proposal Senator Lincoln is offering says basically Enough is enough In defense of their outlandish salaries the insurance company CEOs cite the difficulty of their jobs and the complexity of their tasks The President of the United States probably has a pretty difficult job He has a few complex tasks to confront There is no reason insurance company CEOs should get a tax break on salaries higher than the Presidents That is exactly what the Lincoln amendment does I thank Senator Lincoln for her commonsense proposal I think consumers across America should know that when they pay their hard earned dollars to cover the soaring cost of premiums they are not just chipping in to pay for the CEOs next new yacht or the newest Mercedes in the driveway In homes across Iowa people are clipping coupons and making do with secondhand patching up instead of buying new They have had to make sacrifice after sacrifice to afford premiums that provide coverage for their health care It is outrageous that their hardearned cash goes for goldplated salaries and bonuses Senator Lincoln is right to take a stand against these excesses I urge my colleagues to support her amendment The Lincoln amendment is consistent with a major theme of our legislation It is basically standing up to the health insurance industry on behalf of consumers Her proposal will add one more important item to the list of benefits our legislation will bring to American patients As I said before this bill ends the practice of denying coverage because a person has a preexisting medical condition I would wager probably every Member of this Senate has some kind of a preexisting condition of some sort and every one of us could be turned down if we didnt have the kind of secured program under the Federal employees program Why shouldnt the rest of the American people have the same kind of security This legislation ends the lifetime limits and bans unreasonable annual limits Our bill gives young people better options to stay on their familys and parents plan until they are age 26 It also ends the outrageous practice of charging women higher prices for the same policy the exact same policy a man gets I can remember during my town meetings back in August talking about this issue People were startled to learn that an insurance company can charge a woman up to twice as much for the same policysame age all the same parameters same occupation same kind of history They can charge a woman up to twice as much as a man for the exact same coverage the exact same policy We get rid of that in this bill We do not allow that kind of discrimination in any other kind of industry Why should we allow it in this industry Our bill provides better options for individuals small businesses farms for the selfemployed I have said many times the biggest winners in our health care reform bill are small businesses and the selfemployed Right now they are sort of at the end of their rope They have no bargaining power whatsoever Our bill will create exchanges so they will be able to go on the exchange and pool with other people for more options more competition more transparency available Some places in Iowa we have only one insurance company offering policies There is absolutely no competition Setting up the exchanges will allow our selfemployed and small businesses to get more bargaining power These are the kinds of measures the American people want and need to make sure they get a fair deal on the coverage they buy We need a health insurance industry that is a partner for employers and ordinary Americans charges fair premiums treats us right and pays our bills when we get sick That is what our bill is all about It is to end a lot of these outrageous practices that have gone on for far too long in the health insurance industry A lot of times people say You are always beating up on the health insurance industry Not really We are just taking them to task for where they have gone Years ago when they first started out they were doing a good job Then the greed the normal human nature and greed for more profits higher CEO salaries 24 million salaries for CEOs gold plated benefits packages for all their CEOs and corporate executives it just got out of hand It became a situation where almost one health insurance company was trying to outdo the others in terms of how much money they could squeeze out of the consumers It is just a system that sort of ran amok Now it is up to us in the Congress to rein it in to make the health insurance industry what it ought to bea fair and reasonable competitive system for the consumers That is what this bill does To me that is the American way That is why we have to stay here on the weekends if we have to If we have to be here today fine and tomorrow fine and all next week fine and next weekend and if we have to right through the holidays The American people are looking to us to get this job done We are going to get the job done No matter how much our friends on the Republican side want to delay delay delay and try to kill this bill it is not going to happen This bill is unstoppable because the American people are demanding that we do something about it We are responding to that and we are going to get the job done I yield the floor 
S_PA_CASEY,2009-12-05,2007_2009,0111, President we gather today on a Saturday which as many Americans know is rare but it is entirely appropriate and essential that we make sure we spend the time on a weekend to debate this bill and to get the bill passed I commend the words of Senator Harkin and his great work over many months on this legislation We are grateful for his leadership I commend Senator Lincoln on the amendment we will vote on today regarding executive compensation I rise to speak about children as this bill affects their livesin particular the lives of children who are particularly vulnerable I have said a number of times in this debate that at the end of this debate when the bill is enacted into law we should be able to say that no child is worse off especially a child who happens to be poor or has special needs That is what I rise to speak of this morning I had a joint resolution a number of months ago that was filed relating to this bill It was joined in by Sen ators Dodd Rockefeller Brown Whitehouse and Sanders It was simple It basically said what this chart says No child worse off at the end of the debate It is a fundamental principle but I also believe it is a commitment we must keep When we talk about the legislation before us we are not talking about some new system We are talking about figuring out a wayand I think we have in the Senateto fix what is broken and build upon what works I believe that is what we are trying to do When it comes to children we have special considerations and we have to have unique strategies to make sure they get the best health care possible As so many child advocates tell usand it seems like such a simple maximchildren are not small adults That is a profound statement You cant just take a health care program for adults and overlay that on the health care that is provided to children Children are not small adults They are different The care they get has to be different It has to be tailored and focused on their needs The care they get especially a child who is vulnerable is determinative of their life If we dont provide them the kind of care in the dawn of their life as Hubert Humphrey talked about there is very little after that we can do to save them or to allow them to reach their full potential That bright light inside a child if we miss the opportunity to care for that child will never be the same We have an opportunity in this debate and at the end of the debate with the legislation to positively affect the lives of countless American children I have some changes I will propose to the Childrens Health Insurance Program but I wanted to speak this morning about parts of the bill that speak directly to the needs of at least two vulnerable children two young girls by the name of Hannah and Madeline from Pennsylvania I will get to their story in a moment but their mother Stacie communicated with us and a lot of other people about their lives and their challenges I did want to first review some of the basic parts of the bill We often say this bill contains consumer protections That is a nicesounding phrase but when you talk about consumer protections in the lives of young children such as Hannah and Madeline it takes on a whole new meaning I will talk more about them in a moment I want to walk through some of the basic provisions in the bill as they relate to children and what we have in the bill already No 1 the bill ensures pediatric input into benefit packages so that the skill and the knowledge of a pediatrician and the kind of care they can provide to a child is part of the benefits package Again children are not small adults The bill also ensures benefit packages that include pediatric benefits including critical oral and vision health care We all remember the tragedy last year of Diamante Driver of the State of Maryland a young boy who lost his life because his family did not have coverage for an infected tooth and couldnt afford the care We are talking about a child in America who died from an infected tooth that would have cost 80 to treat This horrible tragedy that everyone in Washington was talking about at the time was entirely preventable We remembered his story and his tragedy in the bill by making sure that oral and vision health care are part of what we do In addition the bill mandates prevention and screenings for children It creates pediatric medical homes People say What is a medical home That is not a place It is a way to treat someone so if an American especially a child has a primary care doctor which many of them unfortunately dontand that is another part of what we are trying to dothat primary care doctor should be surrounded by the expertise we can bring to bear to help the child We have so much knowledge and wisdom and ability when it comes to our doctors We have remarkable pediatricians whose sole focus is to help a child in one part of their needs the health care needs of that child Why should not every child be surrounded by that kind of expertise That is what we are trying to do We strengthen the pediatric workforce We cant just say we need a lot of pediatricians and hope it happens We have to make sure we have a workforce and a recruiter workforce to do that Senator Dodd and I and Senator BrownI know Senator Dodd is on the flooradded a loan repayment provision in the bill for pediatric specialists and providers for mental health services for children I have two more items and then I will get to the story of Hannah and Madeline We expand drug discounts for childrens hospitals and finally increase access to immunizations The CDC will provide grants to improve immunizations for children and adolescent adults But let me talk for a couple momentsI know we have others who are waiting to talk this morningabout these two children Hannah and Madeline The good news isthis picture is a dramatic depiction of what they were suffering from when they were diagnosed with leukemia at the age of 4 They are 11 years old now and they are doing better but they still have enormous challenges in their lives Their mother Stacie Ritter wrote as follows When my identical twins were both diagnosed with a kind of leukemia And she talks about it at age four we were told they would need a bone marrow transplant in order to survive Imagine that I have four daughters and I remember when they were about the age of 4 I never had to worry about any of this I never had to even think about it But if my wife and Imy wife Teresa and I were given this news we would have been given coverage for a condition such as that by an insurance policy because I happened to be a State government employee and now I am a Federal Government employee So I never had to worry about that diagnosis for my daughters Other than the challenge of the diagnosis itself I did not have to worry about coverage But Stacie Ritter and her husband Ben did She says I learned that the insurance company thought my daughters were only worth 1000000 each It sounds like a lot of money Its not She says that with an exclamation point When you add up the costs involved in caring for a patient with a life threatening disease like cancer 1000000 barely covers it I think that is an understatement Fortunately the hospital social worker recommended we apply for a secondary insurance through the state considering the highly probable chance we would hit that million dollar cap And we did hit that cap before the end of treatment Thankfully the state program kicked in and helped pay for the remainder of treatment The State programit sounds a lot like a public option doesnt it an awful lot like a public option So at least for this part of the story they were able to get some help through a State program a kind of public option We will talk more about that later But then Stacie goes on and the lead headline of this section is one word Bankruptcy During this time my husband had to take family medical leave so we could take turns caring for our one year old son and our twins These twins as shown in these pictures at the hospital For the 7 months my husband was out on family medical leave he was able to maintain his employer based insurance for us via 11718 a month COBRA payments My recollection is COBRA was an initiative by the Federal Government to make sure if you lose your job you do not lose your health insurance We have to extend it right nowanother government initiative that was helpful here After spending all our savings to pay the mortgage and other basic living expenses we had to rely on credit cards So a mother and a father who get this diagnosis for their children at age 4 have to rely on credit cards to get the help their daughters need Stacie writes In the end we had no choice but to file bankruptcy And when you file bankruptcy everything must be disclosed we even had to hand over the kids savings accounts that their great grandparents Their great grandparents had given them Is this the kind of system we want when a mother and a father are hit with that diagnosis for their two daughters when they are age 4 that we have a system that says Do you know what We have to cap your coverage We can help you a little bit but we are going to limit it You will figure it out Dont worry That is basically what the system said to them So what are we doing Well we have a bill that happens to speak to these kinds of situations It is ironicI guess is the wordthat on page 16 of the bill which is actually the second page of the text we have a provision that says this A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may not establish lifetime limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary It is not complicated It is not legalese It is very specific to the lives of these two children The first provision in the bill says there are no lifetime limits So you cannot say to Hannah and Madeline Sorry we know you have leukemia and we know you need expert care and treatment but we are going to limit your care So for those who think this is complicated and difficult in a lot of debate here in Washington it is not complicated If we had this provision as a matter of law in effect when Stacie got that diagnosis for her daughters she would not have had to worry about coverage She would not have had to use credit cards and go into bankruptcy and take the savings these children were given by their great grandparents Why do we tolerate this system Why do we go year after year and talk about changing it saying Oh isnt that terrible we have these situations and we let it go and we say that is too bad we couldnt get the bill passed it got a little difficult in Washington Well the time for talk and debate and discussing the finer points of this is over We have to act to make sure a family such as this never has to go through what these parents went through but especially what these two young girls went through I will conclude with this This picture as dramatic as it is I think connotes a lot of hope Look at those two young girls facing the most horrific of circumstances and they are smiling and hopeful But they still need help We are going to be spending time in the next couple days getting this bill done so we can make sure we help them in the future With that I yield the floor

0563; 0564; 0565; 0566; 0567; 0568, Will the Senator yield to know what the deal was Will the Senator yield for another question A vote for the Johanns amendment is a vote for the status quo What does that mean It means seniors will continue to pay higher and higher premiums higher cost sharing due to wasteful overpayments A vote against Johanns means we can extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund that helps benefits I think we are for seniors in this body I urge a vote against Johanns Does the Senator know that the socalled deal was that whereas MedPAC and the administration and the House wanted to make domestic cuts to home health care but rather we went to the home health care industry worked with them and took two of their major suggestions about fraud and abuse as well as outliers so we modified so that the home health industry thought this was fair and reasonable Does the Senator know that was the agreement that was reached Reserving the right to object to be totally candid these are stunt amendments which we have not seen I have never heard of the amendments Reserving the right to object because I have not even seen these amendments I object Will the Senator yield for a question Will the Senator yield for a question Do the Senators realize and do they know that yesterday the Home Care and Hospice Association the National Association for Home Care and Hospices the umbrella organization for home health and hospice wrote a letter to me which basically says For all of these reasons we support the provisions of your health care reform legislation as it relates to home health care Is the Senator aware of that letter the Home Care and Hospice Associations support for this legislation Is the Senator aware of that letter This is not on my time because he is going to filibuster over there If the Senator will yield with time being equally divided on both sides for this colloquy I am going to tell the Senator the deal Will the Senator yield I can answer the Senators question But B on the other hand it is they are docs we care about our docs and we are going to have to find a way to pay for them and we will I think by the end of this year because we have to Docsthere cannot be any reduction Frankly there is a partial fix in this bill anyway It is 1 year with an update At least this bill does take care of docs for at least 1 year and with an increase That is 1 year The House wants a permanent fix Frankly I would love to have a permanent fix but we are having a hard time finding the dollars to pay for it all but this legislation does have a 1year fix for docs I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts President I would very much like to respond to that question First of all I appreciate the implied premise in the statement that the Senator agrees there should be savings The question is Where should the savings go I mean basically the Senator is implying there should be savings and that is very good to hear I think that is a very constructive addition to a part of this dialogue this conversation that we should take savings because there is waste The Senators question is OK you take the savings what should we do with the savings That is the basic question The fact is because of the reforms in Medicare a couple things are happening No 1 we are extending the solvency of the trust fund it is another 5 years The Medicare trust fund will now be extended 5 years so that helps seniors I know the Senator didnt mean this at all but rhetorically earlier he said Why does this side want to throw seniors under the bus I know he didnt mean that I know he knows nobody is trying to throw seniors under the bus nobody wants to do that in the Senate But the fact is these changes do extend the solvency of the trust fund Then he asked a different question and it is a very good question It is a judgment call what should be done with the additional savings This legislation takes those savings to help more people get health insurance One could argue those savings should not be used to help those without health insurance get health insurance for them They could go back to the Medicare trust fund they could reduce the budget deficitsthere are a lot of different options here But this is a health care reform bill In this legislation we are trying to come up with a system if you will that gets some coherence nationwide in health care We dont have a system today It is a hodgepodge It is a collection It is kind of a freeforall Docs do their things hospitals do their things nursing homes do their things each attempt to get health care based on profit motive but it is kind of incoherent There is no realanything there We say lets try to look for coherence We are the only industrialized country in the world that does not have some system some way where everybody has health insurance It seems to me we should try to see if we can have some kind of system some way where everybody has health insurance I know it is extremely complicated There is no doubt it is complicated But if people have health insurance that opens up lot of doors for other reform one is to prevent companies health insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions health care status and so on and so forth because then what they lose on the margin they can make up in volume because everybody has health insurance It is the same with the hospitals same with the pharmaceutical industry same with virtually all providers the whole system If everybody has health insurance not most everybodymore have health insurance the better the system is That is a judgment call But I do believe when people have health insurancethose who do not now have itare going to be more healthy I think that is a good thing Hospitals will not have to worry near as much about uncompensated care which is a big challenge to hospitals these days The average I think is about 1100 1200 a year per family when it comes to uncompensated care that private patients pay Then after that we open up doors to delivery system reform You get the system working a lot better compensating more on quality outcomes rather than quantity et cetera I know the Senator knows much about all these things But it is a judgment call for those savings I am glad the Senator seems to imply there should be or are savings but it is a judgment call as to where the savings go The 21 percent in docs we are going to have to take that up after this bill It is going to be difficult because some want to pay for it some want to not pay for it I grant you that is going to be a huge battle You might ask Why is that not in this bill President this is very frustrating because we have these blocks of time with Senators lining up to take control of the time and to make their points and then they flee the Senate floor and we cannot get into a debate or a colloquy We cannot make points that rebut the points they have made because they have all left the floor They all come in and make their points and then they flee Good I am glad they are staying because I want them to hear this Maybe we will all learn something First of all clearly we all care about home health care I mean lets obviously agree that we all do I see the Senator from Arizona nodding his head in agreement he does care about home health care This Senator cares about home health care The Senator from Wyoming Dr Barrassohere he is over herehe cares about home health care He has talked about home health care We all know seniors would rather be home than in the hospital or a nursing home if that is medically appropriate We all know that I know that personally My mother was in the hospital 2 weeks ago and she is now thankfullypraise the Lordout of the hospital and she is home We have a home health care person coming in every day to see my mom When I am there with the home health care person I am very impressed They do a super job It is really something to behold My mother loves it and I love it We clearly are not going to do anything to cut home health care But another point I would assume all my colleagues agree with is that we want to cut waste if there is waste We want to cut waste out of the health care system Why should we allow waste as representatives of our peoplethe taxpayers We want to cut out waste Again I see the Senator from Arizona is nodding his head yes that clearly we want to cut out waste that may or may not occur in the system Now the next questionand it is a questionis there are lots of forms of waste and one is fraudpeople just ripping taxpayers off and ripping seniors off That is clear There is a lot of waste Let me take one small example in the home health provisions in the Senate bill and that is this The General Accountability Office found that in the home health industry there are a lot of outlier expenditures which are fraudulent that is some home health agencies classify their expenditures for home health as outliersas extra paymentsfor very sick people In fact there is one county in Florida which accounts for 60 percent of all outlier reimbursements whereas they provide health care for only 1 percent of the Nations people The GAO has found lots of examples where the outlier portion of home health is abused It is fraud It is abused Well guess what The home health care industry came to us and said Gee we have some ideas how to stop that because we dont like rotten apples spoiling our barrel We want to stop this fraud that exists with excessive outlier payments So they came to us with some ideas I know it is easy to think that suggestions might be classified as deals or whatnot but that has not happened They came with an idea of how to cut excessive costs in outliers and we have done that That is in this bill There are a lot of other provisions with respect to home health care I know the Senators have letters from their home States I dont know if they are referring to a Housepassed bill which is very aggressive in cutting home health care benefits or whether they have read the most recent language in the Senate bill which essentially is much less aggressive because in talking to the agencies they were saying Yes we can live with these changessuch as rebasing and market basket updates phasing them in instead of immediatelywith the idea again of getting rid of excessive payments and fraudulent payments I say excessive because the home health care industry is enjoying an 11percent growth rate annually as it is right now in dollars Well some think it is 17 percent The chart I have is 11 percent but maybe 17 percent Then the national health care spending rate spending for all care goes up about 6 percent a year about 6 percent a year nationwide Home health without reform is between 11 and 17 percent It is almost double Under this legislation spending will be about 8 percent Remember national health spending is 6 percent and the home health industry did write a letter saying Yes we can live with that My approach frankly in regard to legislation is to work with groups to work with industries and talk to them and not just be draconian and not be arbitrary in cuts or changes You talk to them to see what accommodations can be made consistent with your principles One of my principles is stopping a lot of the fraud and to see if there is a way to cut excessive spending because sometimes there is excessive spending around here and that is what we have done in the home health industry I could go into more detail but I want my colleagues to know there is real solid sound reason for these changes in the home health provisions and it is my judgment this will not hurt home health care for patients That is a very important point to make The same is basically true with the other industriessay with regard to the hospital industry We worked with them and said OK we know you should be cut I talked to a lot of hospital administrators privately and said What do you think They said Yeah Max we should take a haircut Our hospital should take a haircut As you well know you sometimes go to a hospital and you say Good gosh why do they have that big fountain out front Why do they have all that marble Why does this look like the Taj Mahal You dont need that for health care So then they crank that back for the need of their health care Some of the executives say to me privately Yeah there should be some reductions in hospital payments So we go to the hospitals and say What is reasonable Remember this is over a 10year period They say We could take a 155 billion cut But they say that in part because they know what they lose on the margin they can make up in volume because of everybodys health insurance That means too that we can get health care reform You know it is hard to get the health insurance industry to work with us if there is no health insurance for most Americans If there is no health insurance for most Americans then the health insurance industry is inclined to revert back to their old waysor try to anywayunderwriting insurance denying policies based on preexisting conditions et cetera So this whole effort is to work with groupswork with consumer groups with labor with hospitals doctors the insurance industry pharmaceuticalsto see what is reasonable That is democracyto try to get some kind of broadbased kind of rough justice agreement to put this together That is the effort we have undertaken in this legislation I hear criticism well gee we are cutting this and cutting that But lets rememberand I know my colleagues agree with thisthe waste in the American health care system is somewhere between 300 billion a year to upper estimates of 800 billion a year It is waste and we have to figure out a way to get rid of the waste without sacrificing care and actually at the same time improving the quality of care That is the major goal So when you see reductions in some of the payments to providers a lot of that is an honest attempt to get rid of the waste or excessive payments Lets take Medicare Advantage Somebody quoted Tom Scully today I have a quote from Tom Scully that says there is way too much spending in Medicare Advantage I dont have the exact quote but it is basically a public quote that we should cut Medicare Advantage spending because there is way too much expense in Medicare Advantage It is a question of judgment as to how much to cut I grant you But still there are areas where there is excessive spending there is waste and home health care is a good area where we worked hard to refine the changes to get rid of some of the fraudthe outliers I mentionedbut in a way that helps seniors get good home health care If the Senator will yield I thank my colleagues for staying on the floor I appreciate that President I think we have less than 4 minutes remaining on this side I see someone else who wishes to speak I promised him time and Senator Durbin as well I know they are both eloquent orators It is a bit difficult here So I will split it in half the time remaining between each of the two Madam President I ask unanimous consent that we continue with debate and debate only as under the previous order for an additional hour with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each Madam President I yield to the Senator from Michigan Ms Stabenow 5 minutes Madam President I ask unanimous consent that Senator Rockefeller be added as cosponsor to the Lincoln amendment No 2905 Madam President may I ask how much time remains on each side I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois Madam President I suggest the Senator from Iowa be recognized Madam President I ask unanimous consent that 10 more minutes of debate be allowed evenly divided Hearing no objection Madam President I would just like to state as clearly as I possibly can so people understand the Medicare savings are being used for Medicare There is a strong implication by many Senators that the savings are not going to be used for Medicare that it will go someplace else That is not true The Medicare savings are going to be used for Medicare What are the savings I think all Senators would like to reduce waste All Senators agree there is too much waste in the current system It makes good sense to try to attack that waste root out that waste and where there are overexpenditures to try to get the levels down to a reasonable level Everybody knows we have spent too many dollars on Medicare Advantage Everybody knows that That is why we are bringing that cost down There is also waste and fraudI know my good friend from South Dakota understands thisin home health care agencies In the State of Florida for example the Government Accountability Office showed that in Florida 60 percent of the outlier paymentsthe extra money that goes for sicker patientswere in one county That county has 1 percent of seniors It had 60 percent of the outlier payments according to the Government Accountability Office That is fraud They rooted out a lot of fraud in home health Home health is very good My mother is in home health right now It works really well I am very proud of the home health caretaker there who takes care of my mother But we are reducing some of the overpayments We are getting the waste out And guess what Those savings where do they go They go back into Medicare I repeat that They go back into Medicare I do not know if any Senator wants to open up his ears or her ears and hear that They go back into Medicare Guess what That is why the solvency of the Medicare trust fund is extended If these socalled cuts which we hear about on the other side were really cuts as implied by the other side you would think that would hurt Medicare You would think that might reduce the period in which the trust fund would be solvent that it would go insolvent at an earlier time if we were really cutting Medicare No it is the opposite These are savings in Medicare which extend the life of Medicare Please pleaseI see my friend from Iowa I think he understands these Medicare savings go into Medicare for extending the solvency of the Medicare trust fund I see my friend from South Dakota I think he understandshe is sitting there and grinning at me now I think he understands those savings go back into Medicare and extend the solvency of the trust fund So lets make that very clear Second we are using some of the money to reduce Part B premiums That helps seniors If Part B premiums are reduced that helps seniors By how much Madam President 30 billion over 10 years That will reduce seniors Part B premiums That helps seniors We are not taking money away from seniors we are helping seniors giving more dollars to seniors in this legislation In addition there are additional benefits for seniors in this legislation We are starting to close the doughnut holethat is something seniors talk aboutin prescription drug benefits They want that doughnut hole closed I might add to that there are other benefits new preventive benefits under Medicare for mammograms preventive screenings colonoscopies annual wellness visitsall new benefits So I want to make it very clear that it is not true when some Senators say we are taking money away from Medicare and creating a whole new entitlement program We are not taking money away from Medicare and hurting seniors We are reforming how dollars are paid taking the waste out and extra excessive payments and putting the money back into Medicare back for seniors back for beneficiaries Also not one penny of guaranteed benefits will be cut Not one penny can be cut So please people understand that the savings go to help seniors with more benefits extending the solvency of the trust fund That is what we are doing If we keep that firm point in mind then maybe we can go address some of the next steps that are in this bill But that is very important Madam President I do not know how much time I have I see the Senator from Minnesota anxiously sitting over there in the corner Maybe we could give him a couple Madam President if my good friend would allow me to interrupt to propound a unanimous consent agreement so Senators know when votes are going to come up and then continue Madam President I ask unanimous consent that once this agreement is entered it be in order for Senator Kerry or his designee to be recognized to offer the majority sidebyside to the Johanns motion that the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Kerry amendment and that upon disposition of the Kerry amendment the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the Johanns motion that no amendments be in order to the Kerry amendment or the Johanns motion further that upon disposition of the abovereferenced amendment and motion the Republican leaders designee be recognized to call up an amendment related to the Lincoln amendment No 2905 further that on Sunday December 6 after the Senate has resumed consideration of HR 3590 the time until 315 pm be for debate with respect to the Lincoln amendment No 2905 and the Republican amendment identified above with the time on Sunday equally divided and controlled with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each that at 315 pm the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Lincoln amendment No 2905 that upon disposition of amendment No 2905 the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the Republican amendment related to the Lincoln amendment that all of the amendments and motions covered in this agreement be subject to an affirmative 60vote threshold and that if any achieve it then they be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table that if they do not achieve that threshold then they be withdrawn that prior to the second votes

limit this month And I yield Speaker Id like to ask a followup to that comment Does the gentleman expect us to have an up ordown vote on the increase of the debt limit or if not if it is a part as he suggested of another piece of legislation which legislation that would be And I yield Speaker Id like to turn to the question of whether this House will be dealing with what has been reported a second stimulus bill And I know that we have been reading much about the White House job summit today Theres been a lot of reports in the press about the majoritys meeting on a second stimulus bill and Id like to ask the gentleman Mr Speaker if he could clarify the timing the content and the cost of a proposed second stimulus bill And I yield Mr Speaker I would ask the gentleman I note that he did announce that we will be considering HR 4173 the financial regulation bill and perhaps seven appropriations bills I dont know which form that would be in whether it would be separately or in an omnibus form but nonetheless all of these are incredibly large measures costing billions of dollars of taxpayer money stretching over thousands of pages My question Mr Speaker is What is the gentlemans intention as to the period of time which Members and the public will have to review these bills prior to the Members voting on them And does that mean that we will still be consistent with the gentlemans representations on other bills prior to this session that we would have 72 hours for consideration and review of those bills as well as any managers amendment and selfexecuting amendments in a rule And I yield Mr Speaker since this is our first colloquy following Thanksgiving break I would like to ask the gentleman if he could give the Members a sense of what legislation perhaps that we will be voting on for the remainder of this month And I yield And I know Im joined by the gentlelady from Florida in thanking you very much for your work on the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act and bringing that to the floor I yield to the gentleman from Maryland the majority leader for the purpose of announcing next weeks schedule And I do realize that the House has considered its version although we all know that when they come back from conference especially many of the Members on both sides of the aisle have some concerns about earmarks and others which would I think warrant the time to review these bills In the same light Mr Speaker it is the concern of many that we have an opportunity to look at any managers amendment or selfexecuting amendments in the rules that are presented to the body and our having time to review that as well And I would just make that note Mr Speaker I would ask the gentleman does he expect a final health care bill this month And I yield And as a followup to that Mr Speaker I know theres been some discussion or reports that the Senate may be scheduled to be in session past the Christmas holiday and I was wondering Mr Speaker if the gentleman expected that to impact the Houses schedule after Christmas And I yield Speaker I certainly appreciate that extension of an offer to allow us to once again proffer our ideas As the gentleman may know I did speak out yesterday with a list of what I call a no cost jobs plan and I am happy to forward that to the gentleman I have made a similar type of request of the White House and I think have gotten a response that they too may be willing to consider some of the Republican solutions to the current crisis that people are feeling across this country Mr Speaker I would say that I am somewhat heartened to hear the gentleman talk about the ineffectiveness of the first stimulus bill The gentleman did say that the term stimulus was a little broader than what theyre looking at now And in my opinion I thought that the definition of a stimulus bill was to create jobs So if the gentleman now is agreeing with me that the creation of jobs did not hit the mark the way that was promised on the first stimulus bill that we do need to finally focus on job creation that gives me a lot of confidence Mr Speaker because at least were now talking about the same thing And along those lines again I am thankful that the gentleman asked for our solutions and were going to proffer those But I do want to suggest that we can and there are some commonsense things we can sit down and probably agree on that we could do right now that wouldnt cost the taxpayers anything and we wouldnt have to be continuing to mortgage the future of our children I think both of us can agree Mr Speaker that both sides have done their share to dig the hole of incurring too much debt for this country Enough is enough And I do think that we have and will offer solutions that will begin to arrest that trend and at the same time focus on job creation And I would like to ask one more point and then I will yield If we are talking about finally shifting to the mode Mr Speaker of job creation Id like to ask the gentleman has there been any discussion in his caucus about perhaps holding back on some of the measures that are being discussed such as the financial regulatory reform bill coming to the floor next week because there is a study recently released by the University of Chicago University College London and George Mason University economists which said that this package of reform bills coming out of the Financial Services Committee will reduce consumer borrowing by at least 21 percent and reduce new jobs by 43 percent And essentially the study comes to the conclusion that interest rates will rise by 141 basis points which will yield the loss of over a million jobs over the next 5 years So if we are concerned about job creation why are we moving forward with such a measure And I yield And I would say he would agree with me that since the beginning of the 111th priority one for this Nation has been job creation The stimulus bill was brought to this floor with the promise that it would stop unemployment from exceeding 8 percent We are now at over 10 percent national unemployment The facts are the facts Under this administration the deficit has tripled since the last administration left That is the facts The gentleman points out CBO says that weve created X number of jobs I would say to the gentleman while you have people across this country102 percent of the workforce being out of workthere is no way that anyone in this country would believe CBO when it says the economy is better Thats the fact And so if were going to be about job creation my simple point is this about bringing the package of financial regulatory reform bills to the floor I dont doubt the gentlemans intention to try and do the right thing But the reality is this is a case where were doing the wrong thing for the right reason This bill impacts negatively the job creators We know this bill will increase interest rates 141 basis points which means the loss of an additional millionplus jobs over the next 5 years So in that vein I would ask the gentleman again if we are to see our way to work together lets relieve the harm This bill adds to the harm In the same way I would ask the gentleman there is continued talk of the bill otherwise known as Card Check If Ive heard it once I think all Members have from small businesses and large the job creators Please please dont pass that bill because that will create a huge drain on job creation So I would ask the gentleman is there any sense in his caucus that maybe now in times of high unemployment is not the time to bring up Card Check Speaker if the gentleman would like to come to my district and talk to the businesses there I think I could gather up many individuals who have put their entire lifes investment savings on the line and dont want to see Washington or this Congress continue to threaten the very existence of those businesses I yield My purpose in bringing up this notion that we still have this Card Check bill out there is to demonstrate the fact that there really is a disconnect as far as doing what we say and follow what I do Because if were serious about relieving the pain on job creators if were serious about getting Americans back to work we wouldnt be necessarily bringing the wrong bills to the floor for the right reason which is my point Mr Speaker No one is quibbling with intention here I think that I would agree with the gentleman that there is a sense in America that there is not a level playing field at giving people a fair shot at their returns on Wall Street or a fair shot in terms of heavy regulations in hand coming from Washington So we can all agree that we need to make the environment better for job creators and people who want to jump in and take risks But the financial regulatory reform package that is being brought to the floor just as the Card Check bill thats still being spoken of around here those are job killers We ought to at least relieve the harm so that people were relying on to create jobs can get back to work to do that That was simply my point Mr Speaker In closing Mr Speaker I would just note for the gentleman that 28 million Americans have lost their jobs since the passage of the majoritys first stimulus bill and the Nations debt now stands at over 12 trillion I thank the gentleman for his time and I yield back

yield 212 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa Mr King Mr Chairman I must rise today in opposition to HR 4173 Regulatory reform of our financial system is indeed needed However rather than using this opportunity to enact meaningful reform that creates financial stability and encourages economic growth the majority has constructed a massive piece of legislation that will restrict credit availability and does little to address the real problems in the financial industry In addition to dramatically expanding the power of the Federal Reserve and establishing what is in effect a credit czar who will have virtually unlimited authority to restrict consumer choices this bill will create a permanent bailout some would call slush fund for socalled too big to fail companies funded by a 150 billion tax on financial institutions This tax will reduce available capital for lending and will most certainly be passed on to consumers in the form of higher fees As the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee I also rise in opposition to title III the OTC derivatives title that is currently in HR 4173 This is the same title that was adopted by the Financial Services Committee I opposed this title in the committee where Im also a member because it makes it too costly for endusers to manage risk and unnecessarily ties up capital that could otherwise be used to create jobs and grow their businesses However Chairman Peterson and Chairman Frank will bring an amendment to the floor that will strike and replace this derivatives title This PetersonFrank amendment is the product of negotiations between our two committees I prefer I must admit the version reported by the Agriculture Committee but this compromise is significantly better than the current title in the bill and I will support its inclusion But I support its inclusion only if the other secondary amendments that may be offered by my friends on the other side of the aisle are defeated save one I would be remiss if I didnt thank Chairman Peterson for working with Agriculture Committee Republicans in a process that started back in February when our committee reported out HR 977 Chairman Peterson worked in good faith to address issues our members brought to the table and we learned together the concerns of all of the participants in the overthecounter derivatives markets Although we were able to address some of these concerns many still remain unresolved We were able to improve areas most important to endusers the manufacturers the energy companies and food processors that use swap agreements to manage price risk so they can provide consumers with the lowestcost products Endusers should not be regulated as though they were major financial houses residing on Wall Street They did not cause the financial collapse They should not be regulated like they did I would have preferred language that would have made clear that only those entities that can have a significant adverse impact on the US financial system be regulated as major swap participants Similarly I dont understand why market makers that only deal in cleared products need to have additional capital and margin requirements imposed upon them by the Federal Government Finally we should not forget that new opportunities innovative products and services and ultimately economic growth are born from people willing and able to take risk and invest We should not attempt to regulate risk out of existence As it stands now the PetersonFrank amendment allows the appropriate financial regulator to closely monitor market trends and market participants who may generate too much risk for a healthy and robust financial system This amendment also gives the regulator the appropriate tools to reduce risk before it can negatively affect our economy The PetersonFrank amendment isnt perfect but it is a marked improvement over other legislative efforts either proposed or considered Chairman I yield 312 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Indiana Mr Burton Can I inquire of the Chair how much time I have remaining please The Acting CHAIR Ms Titus The gentleman has 312 minutes remaining Madam Chairman I yield myself as much time as I might consume In my concluding remarks Id like to observe to my colleagues you can pass a 1200page bill you can set up the process to generate tens of thousands of pages of rules and regulations you can hire an army of faceless bureaucrats to enforce all of that stuff to make decisions for the economy to make decisions for business to make decisions for people but you cant repeal the laws of supply and demand If you add enough fees and enough rules and regulations to the process of delivering credit you will drive away the sources of credit reduce the supply of credit At the same time we hope to reinvigorate this economy to start it growing again Demand for credit will go up What happens when you lower the supply of credit and you raise the demand for credit Through pieces of legislation like this ultimately you drive up the cost of credit for everyone The laws of supply and demand I know my friends believe theyre sincerely doing the right thing but the right thing in this scenario will drive down the availability of credit while at the same time demand goes up and costs will go up too and that will affect every business every person every entity that needs credit I come from a capitalstarved district in Oklahoma Credits important to every farmer rancher businessperson every person engaged in the industry of energy production every individual with a family trying to send their kids to school Lets not make everything they do cost more I would now yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from the Financial Services Committee Mr Bachus of Alabama 
S_WY_BARRASSO,2009-12-03,2007_2009; 2007_2009; 2007_2009; 2007_2009; 2007_2009; 2007_2009; 2007_2009,0086; 0085; 0087; 0084; 0088; 0089; 0090, President I come to the floor also to talk about Medicare and what I see to be significant cuts in the Medicare Program I practiced medicine in Wyoming for 25 years taking care of families from across the State and many of these wonderful folks who are on Medicare They depend on Medicare for their health care They depend on Medicare Patients depend on it the hospitals depend upon it the physicians the nursing homes the home health care agenciesall of them depend on Medicare for their health care I listened to my close friends from across the aisle come to the floor as well and they seem to be trying to convince the American public that the 2074page bill which weighs over 20 pounds actually does not cut Medicare I heard the chairman of the Finance Committee talk about it on the floor I have heard it from the majority leader The health care reform plan we are looking at on this floor cuts 464 billion from Medicare and I have a list of all the Medicare cuts in this bill page after page column after column When you add them all up it cuts 135 billion from our hospitalsfrom our hospitalsthat are providing the care We have heard about some of the cost shifting from the Senator from Rhode Island Cost shifting occurs Medicare is one of the biggest deadbeats when it comes to paying for hospital services and it is why hospitals end up shifting more costs to people who have health insurance and why for those people their premiums will go up if this bill becomes law So 135 billion cut from hospitals The bill cuts 120 billion from a program called Medicare Advantage There are 11 million Americans in this country who are on Medicare Advantage They know who they are They know it is a program that has worked well for them People ask me what the difference is Why would somebody want to be on a program called Medicare Advantage Well there is an advantage to those seniors who depend upon Medicare for their health care if they are on Medicare Advantage The No 1 advantage is it actually helps coordinate care We know one of the best ways to help people keep down the cost of their medical care is to find problems early and to get early treatment So find the problem and treat it before it gets too bad Well Medicare Advantage does both preventive care as well as coordinated care One of the big problems with Medicare is it will pay a lot for doing something to someone but it will not pay much for helping someone stay healthy But now all of a sudden we are going to cut 120 billion from Medicare Advantage which actually works on prevention and on coordinated care Then there is 42 billion from home health care agencies that will be cut Those are the folks who come into someones home and help them stay out of the hospital The advantage of home health care is to allow people to get care at home and not need to be in the hospital but suddenly we are looking at 42 billion in cuts on Medicare for home health care agencies Then lets take a look at nursing homes 15 billion in cuts for nursing homesthose facilities taking care of people on Medicare which to me means they are actually cutting it from the people who depend on Medicare for their nursing home needs As an orthopedic surgeon I have taken care of many people such as a grandmother who breaks her hip She doesnt need to go into a nursing home permanently but what she needs to do is to go there for a short period of time for rehabilitation where she can get better and get stronger She is not ready to go home and she does not need to stay in a hospital but she needs to be in a nursing home for a period of time to get rehabilitated and then to get ready to go home and go back to an independent life There is a gap in time and nursing homes help with that They are wonderful as a way to give somebody an opportunity to gain their strength In our country such as it is now so many grandparents are living in communities where perhaps their children or grandchildren are no longer living or they cant go and live with a son or daughter but they need additional help and so they go to a nursing home So for that patient who has broken a hipthe type of patient I have taken care of in the hospitalthis bill is going to end up cutting from the hospital 135 billion from Medicare for that patient It will end up cutting nursing homes by 15 billion for patients who rely on nursing homes as they recover from their hip surgery Then once they get home and get ready for an independent life a lot of times they can benefit from home health caresomeone coming into the home and checking on them giving them medications making sure they are doing all right checking their wound and a number of different thingsthis bill will cut 42 billion from home health care agencies again cutting the services to people who depend upon those services for their health care needs Then there is an 8 billion cut from hospice providers people who take care of our patientsmy patientsin the final stages of their life At a time in their life when their body may be riddled with cancer or they just need a place to go and be treated with respect and to be cared for we are cutting 8 billion in this bill from the hospice providerspeople who are there and helping people in the final stages of their life When I look at this I say How in the world can my colleagues on the other side say they are not cutting Medicare for our seniors I read through the bill and there is 135 billion from hospitals 120 billion from Medicare Advantage 40 billion from home health care agencies almost 15 billion from nursing homes and 8 billion from hospice providers for a total of 464 billion for this countrys seniors I dont think we should pass this bill Of course there is another 500 billion in taxes It is a huge and hugely expensive bill To me this is absolutely nothing but robbing our folks who are on Medicare to start a whole new government program I am worried seniors all around the country are going to have less access to doctors especially in rural and in frontier States such as Wyoming I am concerned they are going to see community hospitals and home health care agencies and nursing homesskilled nursing facilitiesstruggling to keep their doors open It is time for this Congress for this Senate to listen to Americas seniors Lets listen to the administrations own chief actuary Richard Foster the chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said if these Medicare cuts take effect then many providers could find it difficult to remain profitable and might end their participation in the program They may say I dont want anything else to do with Medicare I am closing my doors to Medicare patients We cannot have that in this country but I believe that is what this bill does Even the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said these Medicare cuts could reduce access to care or diminish the quality of care Is that what this Senate wants to reduce access to care or diminish the quality of care How many experts does it take to convince the majority party that cutting Medicare to pay for a brandnew government program is irresponsible We all agree Medicare is going broke The trust fund will run out of money in the year 2017 It has more than 37 trillion in unfunded liabilities The Presiding Officer knows that in his State as well as in mine Medicares physician payment formula which calls for doctors to face a more than 40percent cut over the next 10 years is a system that is broken The Reid bill does nothing to fix this problem Instead it takes 12 trillion from Medicare to create a brandnew entitlement program It punishes a group of people in order to benefit another To me that is not reform It will only make the system worse That is why I support the motion we will be voting on today the MCCain motion It says we are not going to finance a new government program on the backs of our Medicare patients on the people who depend upon Medicare for their health care It instructs the Finance Committee to write a bill that doesnt cut hospitals that doesnt cut home health care that doesnt cut Medicare Advantage and that doesnt cut hospice for our seniors who depend upon those services A vote for the MCCain motion gives us a chance to get this right I do want health care reform I just dont want this bill This is the wrong prescription for our country I dont believe we have to take the money out of Medicare and then spend it on a brandnew entitlement program I go home to Wyoming every weekendand I know other Members go home and listen to their constituentsand what I hear from the people in Wyoming is Dont cut my Medicare Dont raise my taxes Dont make things worse for me in this economy I certainly cant afford it The people of Wyoming want practical commonsense health care reform reform that drives down the cost of medical care improves access to providers and creates more choices It is clear this bill has a very different plan in mind It is not too late to work together for meaningful reform We do not have to dismantle the current health care system and build it up in the image of big government and then try to say this is reform The American people are telling us what kind of changes they want and that is why I will be voting for the MCCain motion I yield the floor I dont have that letter with me but everything I look at says this will gut Medicare make it go broke sooner and it will be bad for seniors President my wife Bobbi was diagnosed with breast cancer by a screening mammogram in her forties It is that screening mammogram that has saved her life By the time of the mammogram the tumor had spread and she has had two operations and two full bouts of chemotherapy I do not want a government bureaucrat making a decision for the women of America if they should be allowed to have screening mammograms It saves lives1 in 1900 for women in their 40s The Reid bill empowers bureaucrats to decide what preventive benefits will be allowed for American women The amendment from the Senator from Maryland does the samebureaucrats not the physicians who are doing the treating That is why I support the amendment of the Senator from Alaska because that amendment says the Federal Government cannot use recommendations of the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations from bureaucrats to deny care to anyone including seniors on Medicareanyone in America That is how this decision should be made not by government bureaucrats I yield the floor The Senator absolutely believes we need to find a way to make sure all the citizens of this country have insurance and there are ways to do it allowing people to buy insurance across State lines That doesnt take a 2000page bill There are ways to do it to help get down the cost of care that give individuals incentives to buy their own insurance giving tax breaks to those individuals We could do things with tort reform such as the loser pays rule We could allow small groups to join together to have a better ability to bargain and get the cost of insurance down So this Senator absolutely believes we need to find a way to get everyone insured There are people who need help who dont have help and we need to find a way to do that but it is not this 2000page bill The reimbursement system focuses more on doing things than on helping patients stay healthy and get better Medicare has done a terrible job of that over the years in terms of giving incentives for people or even for paying for preventive services They have not done that over the years This is an illustration of how the system is broken It is now Decemberthe end of the yearand it is the busiest time of year for me as a physician in Wyoming because people have met their deductiblesthose who have insurance have met their deductibles for the yearand they come into the office and say Is it now time for my operation I have to get it done before the 1st of the year because my deductible has been used up and I want to have my operation so I am not going to have to pay for it In this country we have the incentives all wrong in terms of health care We do need health care reform I dont think this bill is the way to do it which is a government takeover of the health care system 
S_CO_BENNET,2009-12-03,2009_2009; 2009_2009,0046; 0047, I would like to call it up at this time President I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with President I was paying very close attention to the floor debate over the last few days and at times I am beginning to wonder what bill it is we are debating Only in Washington could an effort to extend the life of the Medicare trust fund be viewed or distorted somehow as being unfair or bad for seniors We knowand it is in print in the CBO reportthis bill doesnt take away any seniors guaranteed Medicare benefits We know the bill extends Medicare solvency for 5 additional years How does it do that It does it in a way that is different from the way government usually does business which is either adding or cutting from a program It changes the way we deliver medicine in this country and it does it in a way that protects senior benefits and it extends the life of Medicare The attacks on this bill and my amendment have nothing to do with those facts The sad part is that there are ideas on every side of this debate that are worth considering We should be debating those ideas rather than claiming something that is just not true about the bill These Washington tactics of trying to shift health care reform back to some committee to languish is exactly why nothing ever gets done around here The almost unbelievable part of this is that the opponents of my amendment say the health care bill hurts seniors Yet the bill and our amendment is being supported by the AARP the Alliance for Retired Americans Center for Medicare Rights and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare What are the opponents of my amendment actually sayingthat AARP and other senior advocates dont know what they are doing They know what they are doing and they also know what is in the bill The AARP has seniors best interests in mind and they want what is best for Medicare in the long run This bill makes tremendous strides to a more solvent more stable Medicare Program for years to come Unfortunately in the hopes of eventually trying to kill the bill there are people who are making claims that are frightening our seniorsmeant to frighten themhere and also in Colorado where people have been calling on their phones convinced that somehow I want to cut their benefits Nothing could be further from the truth I believe strongly in the sacred trust we have created with our seniors That is why I introduced this amendment Seniors are looking for simple clarity and health care reform can help their lives This amendment says in the clearest and most unambiguous of terms as directly as we can say it that nothing in this bill will cut guaranteed Medicare benefits All guaranteed Medicare benefits stay intact for every senior in Colorado and all across the country Seniors will still have access to hospital stays to doctors home health care nursing homes and prescription drugs The second part of the amendment goes further and says clearly and directly to seniors that we will use this bill to further protect and strengthen Medicare We will extend the life of the Medicare trust fund We will lower premiums or cost share increase Medicare benefits and improve access to providers You dont need to believe me Look at the CBO These improvements will be paid for with money saved in Medicare under this bill What is so regrettable about the debate and so tragic is if we dont actually get this done Medicare would be bankrupt in just 7 yearsin 2017 In the Senate bill we are now considering we extend the trust funds solvency by 5 years We lower premiums for seniors by 30 billion over 10 years That is real money back in the pockets of our seniors We eliminate copays that seniors now have to pay for preventive care That means when seniors go to the doctor for a colonoscopy they would not have to make the copay like they have to under current law When they go to get a mammogram the same is true We know preventive care like that saves lives and also money Most seniors live on a fixed income Free preventive care is the best way to encourage seniors to seek important medical precautions More preventive care is proven to save lives and lower health care costs Mr President health care reform will cut the cost of brandname prescription drugs in half for those who are stuck in the gap of coverage between initial and catastrophic coverage We eliminate the 20percent cut physicians would otherwise see next year making sure seniors can continue to see their own doctor Opponents of health care reform dont have a plan to protect seniors and strengthen the Medicare Program I have heard more criticism about the number of pages in the bill than I have heard about a responsible alternative that would extend the life of Medicare and make the other benefits that are in this bill I wanted to come to the floor with a simple and straightforward message to seniors We will protect Medicare This bill does We will make sure nobody touches your guaranteed benefits This bill does We will make sure Medicare is around for future generations This bill gets us started in that direction That is why I have introduced this amendment and why I support health care reform Everything I have said today is entirely consistent with the findings of the CBO the nonpartisan organization that advises this Chamber This legislation makes explicit the commitment that all of us share to the seniors across the United States of America It is my hope that once this amendment passes we can get beyond the debate we have had over the last 72 hours and get on to the substantive aspects of the bill I urge support for my amendment I yield the floor President I wish to sum up the debate over Medicare in the Senate health bill and on the motion and amendment before us Only in Washington DC could an effort to extend the life of Medicare somehow be distorted as being bad for seniors We know from the Congressional Budget Office a nonpartisan organization that supports both sides of the aisle that this Senate bill does not take away any seniors guaranteed Medicare benefits It extends Medicare solvency for 5 additional years My amendment simply confirms these two facts I am the first person who would insist we have an open process for this debate I think there are ideas on each side of this debate on this bill that are worth considering and should be considered But it is why I find it so confounding that opponents of my amendment want to send the entire bill back to committee so debate stops How can we return home to the people of our States and admit to them we just gave up and sent health care back to the committee for another round The people who do not want change are the people who are content to leave it the same and do not have a theory about how to extend Medicare They would have seniors believe the bill is bad for seniors Yet AARP the Alliance for Retired Americans the Center for Medicare Rights and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare beg to differ They disagree They agree with this amendment and with the underlying bill Senior advocacy organizations grassroots organizations with their ears to the ground hearing the voices and concerns of seniors support health care reform and they agree that with my amendment this bill strengthens Medicare and preserves seniors benefits With the Senate bill finally reaching the floor seniors are looking for simple clarity on how health care reform can help their lives Nothing in this bill will cut guaranteed Medicare benefits and this bill will extend Medicare solvency for 5 additional years It actually makes the system work better instead of cutting or adding to a program It actually changes the way Medicare works so it will be stronger and more stable People may disagree with the prescription but as a general matter everybody knows the status quo is unsustainable and this bill helps seniors It eliminates the copay seniors have to pay for preventive care We know preventive care saves lives and it saves money As we close debate on my amendment and the alternative motion to commit the bill to committee I urge all the Members of this body to consider the consequences of inaction My amendment affirms what the current Senate bill does to help seniors and strengthen Medicare We all know even more can be done so lets continue this debate and reject the motion to commit the bill back to the Senate committee I urge every Member of this body to support my amendment Please vote yes on the Bennet amendment and protect our seniors I yield the floor 
S_OH_VOINOVICH,2009-12-03,1999_2009; 1999_2009,0042; 0043, President over the past several months I have come to the floor on a couple of occasions to remind my colleagues and the American people about the unsustainable fiscal crisis confronting this country Our national debt has exceeded 12 trillion for the first time in history In fact from 2008 to 2009 alone the Federal debt will increase 22 percent boosting the countrys debttoincome ratioor national debt as a percentage of GDPfrom 70 percent last year to 86 percent this year We have not seen this kind of debt to GDP ratio since the Second World War 65 years ago The American people know that this is unsustainable but my Senate colleagues from on the other side of the aisle continue to ignore this reality I pledged that I would continue to cry the emperor has no clothes until we did something to address this crisis I should explain Most people know the story The Emperors New Clothes by Hans Christian Anderson In the tale an emperor goes about the land wearing a nonexistent suit sold to him by a new tailor who convinced the monarch the suit is made of the finest silks The tailorstwo swindlerstell the emperor that the threads of his robes will be so fine that they will look invisible to those dimwitted or unfit for their position The emperor and his ministers themselves unable to see the clothing lavish the tailor with praise for the suit because they do not want to appear dimwitted or incompetent Word spread across the kingdom of the emperors beautiful new robes To show off the extraordinary suit a parade was formed People lined the streets to see the emperor show off his new clothes In this case the health care reform bill before the Senate Again afraid to appear stupid or unfit everyone pretends to see the suit It is only when a child cries out the emperor wears no clothes does the crowd acknowledge that the emperor is in fact naked Like the little boy crying out those of us on this side of the aisle are pointing out this bill is fiscally not responsible Yet while not addressing our current health care challenges the so called health care reform bill we are debating also creates new programs at a time when we arent paying for the one we already have and it adds 25 trillion to what we are already spending I learned as a mayor and as a Governor if you cannot afford what you are doing how can you take on new responsibilities We could be using this opportunity to fix our health care system by finally working to lower health care costs and pass those savings on to citizens who are already overburdened by an expensive health care system Yet instead of commonsense incremental reforms that increase access to affordable quality health care reduce the costs of health care for all Americans and lower our national health care spending we have this bill before us Unfortunately the bill violates the medical principle first do no harm Instead it is more of the samemore spending and more taxeson an already struggling economy this at a time when we are currently witnessing the worst recession this country has experienced since the Great Depression The legislation we are considering when fully implemented as I pointed out spends 25 trillion to restructure our health care system Yet it fails to rein in the cost of health spending in the next decade According to the Congressional Budget Office the Federal Governments commitment to health care that is the cost of health care paid for by the Federal Government would actually increase In other words we are adding more on to this extraordinary debt we have unfunded mandates we havein terms of Medicare The bills proponents will tell you it is paid for But as David Broder points out in his November 22 Washington Post editorial While CBO said that both the Housepassed bill and the one Reid has drafted meet Obamas test by being budget neutral every expert I have talked to says the public has it right These bills as they stand are budgetbusters And that is what many people are hearing right now from their constituents particularly many of those individuals who are taking advantage of the Medicare Advantage Program Furthermore as former CBO Director Douglas HoltzEakin pointed out in the Wall Street Journal this bill uses every budget gimmick and trick in the books What are these gimmicks Most troubling to me and what my colleagues on the floor have been discussing for the last few days is what the bill does to the Medicare Program I think we need to be honest with the American people The Medicare Program is already on shaky footing Despite 37 trillion in unfunded unfundedfuture Medicare costs and the prediction that the Medicare trust fund is expected to be insolvent by 2017 this bill calls for 465 billion in cuts to Medicare not to fix the program but as I said to create new programs For example this health care bill fails to acknowledge the 250 billion that is necessary to reform the Medicare physician payment formula to ensure that our Nations seniors will be able to see the doctor of their choice in the future I have heard it firsthand from family and friends that in some places in Ohio Medicare beneficiaries already face delays for physician services Right in my hometown I have had doctors tell me George if I have somebody before they are Medicare eligible and they go on Medicare I will take care of them I am not taking anymore new Medicare patients because of the reimbursement system I heard the same thing in terms of Medicaid We have a problem out there Sadly my friends on the other side of the aisle do not want to be honest with the American people and include the cost of the physician payment fix in the bill It should be there Lets be honest about it Lets be transparent It is another example I think of the smoke and mirrors and budget gimmicks and tricks that former CBO Director Douglas HoltzEakin mentioned Like I said we must fix our health care system to help millions of Americans who find themselves without insurance and those struggling to pay their health insurance premiums We must increase competition in the private market make it easier for small businesses and individuals to purchase insurance and reform our medical liability system I call this malpractice lawsuit abuse reform We should have done that a long time ago But the fact is that the trial lawyers do not want that to happen So we are doing nothing about a problem that is causing physicians to give unnecessary tests that are driving up the cost of health care in this country Most important we need to focus our efforts on jobs jobs jobs jobs jobs because one of the best things we can do to increase health care coverage is to help businesses start to hire again I need a job One of the reasons I need a job is when I have a job in most instances I have some form of health care We have a lot of people who are being dropped off We need more jobs We should be concentrating on that if we want to up the number of people who can get health care To repeat we do not need to create another set of government programs that spends an additional 25 trillion to build a new entitlement system when we cannot afford the one we have now That is the biggest thing with me If you cannot afford what you have how can you take on more When we do that we are being fiscally irresponsible We should deal with what we have It is amazing to me If you look around the country States are cutting their expenses and they are raising taxes And what are we doing in Washington We are taking on more expensive programs we cannot afford That is what I think is troublesome to me as a debt hawk We need to understand what we are doing The American people are paying attention and they know that the emperor has no clothes when it comes to doing something about our unsustainable fiscal crisis We are losing our credibility and our credit worldwide They know it is immoral to be putting this debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren I believe this health care bill does that exactly It exacerbates our current fiscal situation There are lots of good things out there a lot of good things we all would like to do But just like a family if you cannot afford what you are doing now how can you afford to take on more responsibility in terms of debt Mr President I yield the floor President I rise today to join my good friend and Chairman on the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee Senator Akaka to ensure that security clearance reform efforts begun in recent years continue by cosponsoring the Security Clearance Modernization and Reporting Act of 2009 Since the 1990s the Governments Accountability Office GAO has documented problems with the Department of Defenses DoD personnel security clearance program and in 2005 added the program to its high risk list DoDs personnel security clearance program has remained on the 2007 and 2009 high risk lists In an effort to address this matter and improve the security clearance process Congress set benchmarks for the time taken to issue clearances in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 IRTPA IRTPA also required the President to select a single agency or office to oversee the security clearance process across the federal government and required uniform policies regarding the security clearance process reciprocal recognition of security clearances among agencies an evaluation of technology to expedite security clearance processes and a plan to reduce the length of the security clearance process While progress has been made to decrease the amount of time it takes to obtain a security clearance more improvement is needed to fully reform the security clearance process but reform efforts have been delayed this year by an interagency review of the security clearance reform initiatives undertaken over the past several years To ensure that the good work begun with passage of IRTPA in 2004 I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Akakas legislation that extends IRTPAs reporting requirements relating to security clearance reform efforts beyond their current 2011 expiration date and requires more details in those reports about the amount of time required by individual agencies to conduct both security clearance investigations and adjudications To ensure that efforts begun over the past several years continue the bill codifies portions of Executive Order 13467 which deals with reforming processes related to eligibility for access to classified information The bill also calls for the development of the strategic plan GAO has been asking for since the DoD personnel security clearance program was put on its high risk list in 2005 and requires a more detailed information technology strategy relating to security clearance reform efforts I am proud to cosponsor this bill and thank the Senator from Hawaii for his work on this legislation to address such an important issue By Mr KERRY for himself Mr Cardin Mr Kaufman Mrs Gillibrand and Mr Menendez S 2835 A bill to reduce global warming pollution through international climate finance

S_RI_REED,2009-12-03,1997_2009; 1997_2009; 1997_2009,0093; 0094; 0095, President I think it is important to focus on the fiscal difficulties we have today but I think it is also important to recognize the probable causes of these huge deficits two wars unfunded no attempt to fund them spent simply by running up the deficit tax cuts which were unfunded and which did not ultimately generate the kind of sustained economic growth and job growth that their supporters advertised and then the Medicare Part D program an entitlement program which was also completely unpaid for Today we have people talking about entitlement reform how that is a key aspect of health reform But so many of my colleagues on the Republican side supported President Bush when he proposed the Medicare Part D program a worthy program in concept but in the context of not paying for it it is a concept that is costing us greatly today Additionally it is particularly ironic at this moment because we are considering a MCCain motion that would report this health care bill back to the committee with the instructions to restore 400 billion in spending roughly over 10 years I cannot think of anything more contrary to the notion of entitlement reform What we have tried to do in this bill is to restructure Medicare so that it will continue providing quality health care but also recognize the high costs we are facing going forward and the general economic climate we face today Again let me remind you in January 2001 the unemployment rate was about 46 percent When President Obama took office it was double that and growing and continuing to grow We have seen some effects to limit this growth but it is still a critical issue Again this reform package is designed not only to deal with the quality of health care accessibility to health care and affordability of health care but it is designed to over the long term begin to rein in costs that are absolutely out of control Those suffering the most from this course are the American people and in some respects small business men and women Their health care costs are going up faster than any other costs and in many instances faster than wages and it is unsustainable If in my State of Rhode Island we do not take effective action we will see within several years premiums reaching 24000 to 30000 a year for a family of four We cannot sustain that If someone is interested in taking the very difficult step of entitlement reform they would reject the MCCain motion But there are other reasons to reject the amendment as well First the funding that has been eliminated from the current health care system and the system going forward has been eliminated because it does not improve care This is particularly true in Medicare Advantage This was a program that was developed and sold essentially to the American people as cost containment for Medicare This was one of the proposals that would rein in outofcontrol health care costs by giving insurance companies the ability to manage more effectively Of course what we have seen is a significant increase in payments to Medicare Advantage payments over traditional Medicare Of course these insurance companies can manage health care very well as long as they are receiving very significant premium payments from beneficiaries But those premiums do not essentially go to better health care It certainly goes however to better profits for the insurance companies Indeed with Medicare Advantage there is a rebate given to each insurance company This is not the case with traditional Medicare The rebate was designed essentially to provide again lower cost access to health care benefits for the consumers of Medicare Advantage The GAO found that 19 percent of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries actually pay more than traditional Medicare for home health care and 16 percent pay more for inpatient services Here is the irony We are paying the insurance companies more but the beneficiaries of Medicare Advantage are indeed are also paying more So there is no cost savings in this regard in this program at least The other point which is I think critical and I alluded to is that for the same services you receive in Medicare Advantage there is on average a 14percent increase overall for those similar services in traditional Medicare We have to I think take tough steps to eliminate these over payments but steps that will enhance the quality of care for seniors and that is what is being done in this bill While some of these resources are being used to help redesign a system for all Americans there will also be significant improvements for seniors for care that is more effective and efficient and less costly Let me suggest something else We are all paying right now for the cost of uninsured Americans It has been estimated that every private insurance plan in this country is payingevery individual payer businesses or individualabout 1000 a year for uncompensated care That is the cost hospitals shift from their uncompensated care on to the insurance providers the carriers and that is translated into higher premiums for all Americans Under this legislation the hospitals will now see patients presenting themselves with an insurance card Mr President over 94 percent of Americans it has been estimated will be covered under our proposal So instead of showing up for free care they will be under an insurance plan The hospitals will benefit Medicare Medicaid and the whole health care system will benefit Again this is one of the changes that would be reversed by the MCCain motion Also we have taken steps so that hospitals will be much more effective in managing their patient flow Readmissions will hopefully be reduced by some of the provisions in this legislation There are many things we should do and will do but I believe we can successfully balance expanding our coverage system protecting quality of care but also recognizing as has been suggested the fiscal implications not just for the moment but going forward I suggest if someone is serious about entitlement control serious about the fiscal implications of this legislation or any other legislation they will not simply order the committee to restore these cuts They would do something much more proactive and indeed support what I believe are sensible sound proposals to provide quality to ensure that over the long run Medicare is more solvent In factthe final pointthe legislation before us would extend the life of Medicare the solvency of Medicare over at least 5 years So for those people who say we are trying to end Medicare their solution is simply to let it go bankrupt apparently in 2017 or to simply ignore it and let it find its own fate We can do better I urge rejection of the MCCain

1974 to require a lifetime income disclosure to the Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions President I rise today to introduce the Transitional Federal Medical Assistance Percentage FMAP Act and I am pleased to do so with the support of Senators Brown Whitehouse Akaka Durbin Klobuchar and Begich This bill is an important step in continuing the conversation about how we can help our States businesses and individuals as our economy recovers In my State of Rhode Island the economic downturn has been particularly hard hitting on families and businesses As a result the State has seen a decline in tax revenue and an increased enrollment in safety net programs like Medicaid Revenue from the sales tax is down over 7 percent income tax receipts are down 23 percent and corporate tax revenue is down nearly 10 percent At the same time unemployment rates have soared to new heights topping 13 percent earlier this year In the past 2 years 40000 Rhode Islanders have lost their employer sponsored health insurance Many of these individuals have come to rely on Medicaid for health coverage This has caused great strain on the States resources and its Medicaid program In November we learned that the estimated Medicaid caseload for the year will cost over 40 million more than what the State had initially estimated in its budget The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act which I supported provided States with additional Federal assistance through 2010 States have used these funds to help balance their budgets minimize harmful cuts in public services and very importantly to prevent tax increases in many cases However even with the funding from the Recovery Act Rhode Island will close the current fiscal year 2198 million in the red A total of 38 States have looked ahead to fiscal year 2011 and they have estimated 92 billion in combined deficits in the coming year As the State fiscal year nears and more States have had ample time to analyze their fiscal health it is expected that the total shortfall will likely equal 180 billion As Congress debates health reform and works to ensure that every American has access to health insurance in 2014 we must not forget about ensuring that Americans have access to health insurance between now and then as the economy slowly recovers and as state budgets begin to heal During this tough time we need to help individuals businesses and States and I am particularly concerned with making sure our States have the resources to provide adequate health care Unless Congress acts on FMAP legislation States will be forced to use their limited resources to cover an expanded Medicaid population beginning in January 2011 Since States are planning their fiscal year 2011 budgets which will begin in July many Governors are requesting Congress act now to provide States with additional Federal support The Transitional FMAP Act would extend the enhanced FMAP funding which we passed in the Recovery Act for two additional quarters This extension accounts for the prolonged recession and ensures that the pressure of Medicaid needs do not overwhelm the States The bill would also begin a slow decrease of enhanced FMAP funding from July 2011 through December 2013 This will help States as they recover and ensure that States do not experience a gap in assistance prior to health reformrelated FMAP levels beginning in

S_AK_MURKOWSKI,2009-12-22,2002_2009; 2002_2009,0085; 0084, Madam President I want to speak about small businesses because we have all been talking about the impact to small businesses Under this bill as we know small businesses are going to be penalized 750 per employee if even one of their employees seeks governmental health care through Medicaid or through Federal subsidies So if you have 50 or more employees you can be expected to pay fines in an amount of 750 per employee which amounts to over 37000 or 3000 for that individual employee I think we need to put it into perspective in terms of who these businesses are These are the solopractitioners like the onelawyer office or the small doctors office If these individuals purchase health care in the individual market they are going to see their premiums go up an extra 1160 per year for a familynearly 3000 more in 2016 Alaska is defined as a highcost State If you are a small business that can afford to pay good health and dental benefits for your employees and those benefits amount to 8500 per individual or 23000 per family in a highcost State such as Alaska you look to be hit with a 40percent excise tax because you basically want to provide your employees with good benefits Again according to ISER Alaska is a high cost state and thus roughly 50 percent of health plans in Alaska will be subject to the tax by 2016 compared to only 19 percent average in the Lower 48 Again by 2016 50 percent of the plans in my State will be subject to this 40percent excise tax I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter we received from the municipality of Anchorage Police and Fire Retiree Medical Trust There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows Municipality of Anchorage Police Fire Retiree Medical Trust December 15 2009 Plan Administrator Report At the November 24 2009 PFRMT board meeting I brought to your attention a health care bill HR 3590asPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act being considered in the US Senate that contains provisions that if implement into law would require that the Municipality of Anchorage MOA and the Trust to make changes to their current business practices S 1796Americas Healthy Future Act of 2009 also contains these changes and could become effective January 1 2010 Three provisions in the bill that are of particular concern are 1 Inclusion of health care benefits as taxable income to employees Not only will this increase the employees taxable income but the MOAs payroll taxes will also increase SEC 9002 INCLUSION OF COST OF EMPLOYERSPONSORED HEALTH COVERAGE ON W2 p 1996 b EFFECTIVE DATEThe amendments made by this section shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31 2010 2 Taxation of MOA health care plans This tax will be imposed on the employer The current MOA health plan design is apt to be considered to have an excess benefit This would make it subject to a 40 excise tax There is also an aggregation rule for the value of employee coverage with multiple employers or retiree medical example veterans and rehired police officers and fire fighters If a retiree would purchase MOA Health Insurance that is considered excessive the 40 excise tax would be incurred by the general fund of the Medical Trust One may argue that the tax is a tax to the employer The argument can also be made that the Trust is an integral part of the Municipality This was a conclusion determined in IRS PLR0616496 Thus the tax would be payable from the Trust general fund assets SEC 9001 EXCISE TAX ON HIGH COST EMPLOYERSPONSORED HEALTH COVERAGE P 1979 any excess benefit with respect to coverage there is hereby imposed a tax equal to 40 of the excess benefit d 1 E GOVERNMENTAL PLANS INCLUDED IRS PLR0616496 Because the Trust is an integral part of the Municipality it is not required to file an annual federal income tax return p5 3 Current Municipal employees are able to be reimbursed tax free from money that they have placed in their flexible spending account for over the counter OTC medicine Retired police officers and fire fighters also currently are allowed this reimbursement as part of their medical benefit Under the rules of this bill these reimbursements would no longer be allowed This is a reduction in employee benefits It is also likely to encourage an increase the utilization of more expensive nonOTC prescriptions as they are a covered expense SEC 9003 DISTRIBUTIONS FOR MEDICINE QUALIFIED ONLY IF FOR PRESCRIBED DRUG OR INSULIN p 1997 This bill contains expenses that should be considered and planned for accordingly A December 2009 press release from Mercer an HR consultancy stated Nearly twothirds 63 percent of employers in a recent survey by Mercer say they would cut health benefits to avoid paying an excise tax included in the Senates Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act unveiled November 18 Mercer estimates that one in five employers offer health coverage that would be deemed too generous and thus be subject to the Acts 40 percent nondeductible tax on the excess value Two letters have been sent to the MOA informing them of these matters The dates of these letters were November 25 and December 5 2009 Since then Larry Baker Senior Policy Advisor in the Mayors Office informed me that the MOAs benefit consultant The Wilson Agency affirmed that the current MOA health plans are going to be subject to the 40 excise tax They are contacting Senator Begich but beyond that he did not specify what the course of action was going to be I recommend two points of action Bring the PFRMT membership up to date of this situation And contact Senator Begich to inform him of the negative impact that these bills will have on our retired police officers and fire fighters medical benefit Sincerely Lorne Bretz Plan Administrator We received this letter last week In the letter they cite specifically three provisions in the bill that are of particular concernNo 1 inclusion of health care benefits as taxable income to employees It states Not only will this increase the employees taxable income but the Municipality of Anchorages payroll tax will also increase The second point is the taxation of the municipalitys health care plans This tax will be imposed on the employer The current municipality health plan design is apt to be considered to have an excess benefit This would make it subject to a 40 excise tax They go on to say There is also an aggregation rule for the value of employee coverage with multiple employers or retiree medical If a retiree would purchase the municipalitys Health Insurance that is considered excessive the 40 excise tax would be incurred One may argue that the tax is a tax to the employer The argument can also be made that the Trust is an integral part of the Municipality Thus the tax would be payable from the Trust general fund assets Their third point is Current municipal employees are able to be reimbursed tax free from money they have placed in their flexible spending account for over the counter medicine Retired police officers and firefighters also currently are allowed this reimbursement as part of their medical benefit Under the rules of this bill these reimbursements would no longer be allowed This is a reduction in employee benefits It is also likely to encourage an increase in the utilization of more expensive nonOTC prescriptions as they are a covered expense There are about 400 members that are part of the Police and Fire Retiree Medical Trust When they find out as I am sure they will that essentially they are going to be taxed on their planI think most of these firefighters and police officers dont view themselves as having access to a Cadillac plan They are just firefighters and police officers But this is coming from their trust fund expressing great concern over what we have in front of us I have mentioned that we have received a copy of an opinion piece from a primary care provider in Anchorage who has outlined why she is opting out of the Medicare system in Alaska I ask unanimous consent to have her letter printed in the Record There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows From the Anchorage Daily News Dec 18 2009 Opinion Doctors and Patients Not Feds Know Best By Ilona Farr MD I have made the heartwrenching decision as a physician to opt out of Medicare I do so after working with Sen Stevens Sen Murkowski and Rep Young for a decade in hopes we could ensure seniors would be able to continue to receive medical services in Alaska On a visit costing 115 Medicare pays 40 secondary insurance pays 7 and the rest68is a loss not a tax writeoff It takes six insurance paying patient visits to offset losses from one Medicare or Medicaid patient The House health care bills HR3590HR3962 increase the number of people not paying their share of the costs and will lead doctors to opt out of Medicare or retire early Anchorage has 75 family physicians down from 180 Physician shortages like these are caused by government interference in the free market Government artificially keeps reimbursement rates low forcing other patients and insurance companies to pick up the additional costs Family practice residencies are filled with foreign medical graduates because of high costs more than 200000 associated with medical school Low physician reimbursement rates make it difficult to repay loans Medicare and Medicaid auditors are paid on commission can fine us 2000 to 50000 for one charting mistake or billing error and then extrapolate this over the practice and drive us out of business all for one minor mistake There is fraud but this system that penalizes us severely for simple errors is untenable In these bills malpractice reform is restricted health savings accounts which help reduce costs and fraud are essentially eliminated and taxes and fees on insurance and medical services are increased There are no Medicare Medicaid rate rule or audit reforms or tax writeoffs for business losses One section in Sen Harry Reids bill says Medicare will no longer pay for home health services durable medical goods and possibly labs Xrays prescriptions or other services written by providers who have opted out of Medicare Many talented physicians have had to opt out of Medicare and by this law must opt out of Medicaid and the militarys Tricare also to stay in business People will no longer be able to see these physicians because of government financial restrictions or will be forced to pay all medical bills associated with these visits themselves Bills under consideration cut Medicare spending by 460 billion raise fees on medical services increase physicians administrative burdens promote electronic medical records with mandated reporting of outcomes data and increase business costs so it will be impossible for small practices to survive My decision to withdraw from Medicare was also precipitated by US Preventive Services Task Forces recommendation that breast cancer screening mammograms should only be done on women between age 50 and 74 Approximately 48 percent of my patients with breast cancer developed it before age 50 Up to 12 percent of my practice mostly young mothers could have died if this were a national guideline The Senate bill has this task force and other committees determining what tests will be covered for patients I am concerned that penalties may be imposed on insurance companies and maybe providers for going against these guidelines The Hippocratic Oath compels us to protect the health of all humans throughout life and many provisions in these health care bills would cause us to violate that oath Physicians and patients not government should decide the best most costeffective medical treatment for patients Government should not dictate to insurance companies or providers which tests can or cannot be covered Medicine is changing too rapidly for guidelines to be made at a national level I have worked in government medical facilities and in private practice for the last 26 years Physicians provide timelier less costly and more patientoriented care if not overseen by hordes of nonproducing government administrators I am in favor of reform but current bills before Congress will collapse our health care system and work against the freedoms we are guaranteed under the Constitution Government should not be allowed to force people to purchase health insurance mandate what health care services you are allowed or increase our taxes astronomically to support a huge government health care bureaucracy that will bankrupt us as individuals and as a nation One of the things we dont have in this legislation is a provision that relates to medical malpractice It has been stated that in Alaska you tried medical malpractice reform and we havent seen the positive impacts I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement from the Alaska State Medical Association along with an article that was published in Alaska Medicine in September of 2009 entitled Malpractice Relief Lower Premiums Tort Reform Add to Alaskas Appeal There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows Alaska Physicians Group Senator Erred on Tort Reform Anchorage Alaska Dec 21 2009The Alaska State Medical Association ASMA which represents physicians throughout Alaska and is primarily concerned with the health of all Alaskans is taking issue with Sen Mark Begichs stance on medical liability reform In an interview with Fox News on Dec 7 2009 Alaskas junior senator opined that tort reform in his home state has not worked ASMA asserts that Begich did not accurately portray the facts in that nationally broadcast interview and that medical liability reform in Alaska serves as a shining example for the other 49 states Alaskas physicians have worked hard for at least the last 35 years to achieve meaningful and equitable liability reform measures ASMA President Brion J Beerle MD wrote today in a letter to Sen Begich Those efforts have resulted in a stable marketplace for insurers that provide medical professional liability coverage to Alaskas physicians at rates that are competitive More than 90 of medical liability coverage in Alaska is provided by two notforprofit insurersMIEC and NORCAL that are owned by their policyholders mutual insurers and overseen by boards of governors all of whom are physicians with representation on those boards by Alaska physicians The cumulative result of the Alaska physicians advocacy has been a success for physicians and their patients Beerle wrote For example according to the Medical Liability Monitor Survey 2008 premiums paid by Alaskas internists average just 24 of those paid by the interests in the five most expensive states general surgeons pay about 25 and obstetriciansgynecologists pay about 31 According to that same 2008 survey the premiums for those same specialties are in the lowest quartile of all states plus the District of Columbia MIEC also has returned excess earnings to its policyholders in 16 of the last 19 years and NORCAL policyholders received dividends in 12 of the last 18 years MIEC has in addition reduced its rates by 5 in 2009 and also for 2010 the ASMA president added Writing on behalf of the association he leads Beerle noted that because of tort reform premiums Alaskas physicians pay for liability coverage is generally not significant in the cost of operating a medical practice The factor that does have a material effect is the cost of practicing defensive medicine he wrote The American Medical Association has estimated that the annual cost of the practice of defensive medicine in the United States ranges from 99 billion to 179 billion Until medical liability reforms similar to those enacted in Alaska are adopted nationwide the additional costs of the practice of defensive medicine will continue to be a driver in the cost of health care in Alaska and throughout the country Beerle concluded From Alaska Medicine Sept 2009 Malpractice Relief By Andrew Firth and Roger Holmes It is seemingly a universal truth that wherever one practices in the United States malpractice insurance costs too much But in Alaska the average medical malpractice premiums are lower than at least 35 other states a national survey shows Physicians in Alaska pay much less than their colleagues in the nations five most costly states according to the Medical Liability Monitor Survey 2008 Premiums paid by Alaskas internists average 24 percent of those paid by internists in the five highest states surgeons here pay roughly 25 percent and obstetriciangynecologists pay about 31 percent The top five states vary by specialty Some of the difference in cost may be societal but part of it has to do with the tort reforms that have passed or not passed in each state In Alaska our history is similar to many states where the costs are lower Its a state with an active medical society the Alaska State Medical Association an engaged membership a broad coalition of providers and an enlightened legislative body that recognizes the connection between malpractice costs and access to care In 1975 Alaskan physicians suddenly were confronted with a disappearing market for medical malpractice insurance The Legislature stepped in and created the Medical Indemnity Corporation of Alaska MICA a quasistate agency funded with state money but run by a private board of directors appointed by the governor At the same time the Legislature modified the law governing medical malpractice claims Among the key changes The burden of proof was codified making it clear that a practitioner could only be judged against those in the same field or specialty Res ipso loquitur a legal doctrine that switched the burden of proof to the healthcare provider in certain instances was abolished The law required that juries be told that injury alone does not raise a presumption of negligence or misconduct Plaintiffs were prohibited from filing inflammatory pleadings asking for millions of dollars The law of informed consent was codified The law prohibited claims that a healthcare provider had orally agreed to achieve a specific medical result Plaintiffs were prohibited from obtaining a recovery for sums that had been paid by collateral sources except for a select few federal programs that must by law seek reimbursement During the 1970s and 80s physicians encountered rising and falling malpractice costs as the insurance cycle reacted to changing claim experience in Alaska and elsewhere culminating in the departure of several medical professional liability MPL insurers in the late 1990s In the mid1990s the Alaska State Medical Association and several MPL insurers joined with the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association Providence Hospital and the business community to press for additional tort reforms The result was the 1997 Tort Reform Act Among its achievements was a cap on noneconomic damages of 400000 except in cases of severe disfigurement or severe permanent impairment in which the cap rises to 1 million Punitive damages were limited and the standards for awarding them were tightened Prejudgment interest was tied to the federal discount rateAlaskas current rate is 325 percent Joint and several liability was abolished in favor of comparative fault in which each party is responsible only for its percentage share of the total fault And parties were prohibited from using experts in medical malpractice cases unless the expert is licensed trained and experienced in the same discipline or school of practice as the physician and certified by a recognized board A coalition called Alaskans for Access to Health Care comprising ASMA Alaska Physicians Surgeons the hospital association and Providencewent back to the Legislature in 2005 and argued for an even lower noneconomic damage cap for healthcare providers The result was a limit of 250000 in all cases except when damages are awarded for wrongful death or a severe permanent physical impairment that is more that 70 percent disabling For those the limit is 400000 Since then Alaska has enjoyed a stable malpractice climate with both of its major insurance carriers reducing rates andor returning profits through dividend distributions The caps make a big difference For example NORCAL Mutual which writes policies in Alaska and California also does business in Rhode Island which does not limit noneconomic damages in malpractice cases Most rates for physicians with at least three years practice experience mature rates in Rhode Island are at least double the mature rates for physicians in Alaska NORCAL Marketing and Communications Manager Brent Samodurov wrote in an email to Alaska Medicine For several medical specialties NORCAL Mutuals rates for Rhode Island are nearly triple those for Alaska MPL carriers There are two major MPL insurers in Alaska MIEC and NORCAL Both companies are owned by their policyholders mutual insurers and are overseen by a board of governors consisting of physicians MIEC came to Alaska in 1978 and is sponsored by ASMA NORCAL became active in 1991 after it purchased MICA According to data published by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners MIEC wrote 697 percent of all medical malpractice premiums for physicians in the state during 2008 and NORCAL wrote 234 percent Ten other carriers shared the remaining 69 percent of the market Typical of these types of policyholderowned companies both MIEC and NORCAL have a long history of returning profits to policyholders through dividend distributions NORCALs Alaska clients have received dividends in 12 of the past 18 years the most recent amounting to 12 percent of each eligible policyholders premium as of Sept 30 2008 according to Samodurov He noted Dividends declared are directly related to the companys loss experience in each state MIEC has a similar record of returning profits to its Alaska members MIEC policyholders have received dividends in 16 of the past 19 years in amounts that average 288 percent of basic premiums for 1 million3 million limits in each one of the past 19 years The bottom line is from the Alaska State Medical Association The cumulative result of Alaska physicians advocacy has been a success for physicians and their patients Again we have seen the positive impact in Alaska because of the laws we have passed It is unfortunate that we didnt take that opportunity as we dealt with health care reform these past many months I yield the floor Exhibit 1 December 21 2009 US Senate Washington DC Dear Senator We are writing to express our strong opposition to language contained in the Managers Amendment to HR 3590 which excludes the construction industry from the small business exemption contained in the bill We regret that this is our first opportunity to address this issue though the fact that the Managers Amendment was made public less than two days before the first vote on the matter has increased the difficulty of playing a constructive role in the legislative process In recognition of the negative impact that a mandate to provide health insurance will have on employers HR 3590 exempts employers with fewer than 50 employees from the fines levied on those who cannot afford to provide their employees with the federal minimum standard of health insurance However the Managers Amendment singles out the construction industry by altering the exemption so that it applies to only those firms with fewer than 5 employees This narrowly focused provision is an unprecedented assault on our industry and the men and women who every day make the bold decision to strike out on their own by starting a business Our members benefit packages reflect the reality of their business models and they proudly offer the best health insurance coverage that they can afford It is unreasonable to presume that small business owners can bear the increased cost of these new benefits simply because Congress mandates that they do so In the real world where the rhetoric surrounding this legislation will meet the stark reality of the employer struggling to make payroll this special interest carve out is simply another bill to pay in an industry that with an unemployment rate exceeding 18 and more than 200 billion in economic activity lost in the past year already is struggling to survive And we would be remiss if we failed to question the justification for singling out the construction industry to bear such a burden We are unaware of any data or evidence that suggests that the needs and struggles of a construction contractor with fewer than 50 employees are so different from those of small business owners in other industries and absent such convincing evidence we are left to assume that this specific provision is merely a political payoff to satisfy the desires of a small constituency As Congress moves forward in the legislative process for HR 3590 we strongly encourage you to address this onerous provision that needlessly singles out small construction industry employers Sincerely Air Conditioning Contractors of America American

Contractors Association National Utility Contractors Association PlumbingHeatingCooling ContractorsNational Association Small Business Entrepreneurship Council US Chamber of Commerce President I wish to acknowledge the very eloquent and articulate comments of my friend from Florida We recognize that his time in the Senate has been relatively short but in terms of an individual jumping in with both feet and embracing the challenges we clearly have in front of us and representing the constituents of the State of Florida in the manner he has I think that deserves public recognition and I thank the Senator for his leadership We have had occasion to talk about the similarities between Alaska and Florida You might not think there would be much in relationship theremy being from the North and the cold versus the sunny South in Florida But when it comes to our senior populations this is where we truly have a shared interest Florida has probably the largest number of seniors per capita and in my State of Alaska we are the State that has the fastest growing population of seniors per capita One might not think of Alaska as being a retirement haven but more and more we are becoming so and we share the same problems when it comes to access When you cant get in to see a provider when that insurance card is all we have given you then we havent done anything to provide for a level of care to improve the situation for the residents of Florida or the residents of Alaska So what we are doing todayas we move toward final passage on legislation that I would concur with the Senator from Florida does not fix the problemwe are not dealing with how we appropriately and adequately provide for access to quality health care We have much work remaining before us We have had some time these past couple daysactually these past couple weeksas we have spent a considerable amount of time in our offices waiting for votes at 1 in the morning or votes at 7 oclock in the morning and I have had a chance to go through some things on my desk but I have also had an opportunity to spend a lot of time checking to see what people are saying when they are contacting our office The volume of correspondence whether in emails or faxes or phone calls coming in from Alaskans during this time has been absolutely unprecedented I think typically in the legislative calendar about this time several days before Christmasyou dont see constituents contacting their Senators and pounding the drum Well let me tell you the people in Alaska are pounding the drum In just the past 24 hours we have gotten probably close to about 500 health care emails that have come in Overwhelmingly these are emails from constituents saying No this is not good You must do what you can to prevent this reform package as you call it from moving forward It seems the longer the people from Alaska the longer the people from around this country have to look at what is contained in this 2000plus page bill the more they realize the negative impacts the consequences to them and their families and their businesses and they are no longer silent I have had so many calls and letters coming from people saying I have never weighed in with you before never weighed in with my delegation but this is something I cant keep silent on When you look at some of the ones that have come in these are just todays This is one from a woman in Anchorage who says Yesterday on the TV news I heard about the sweetheart deal Senator Nelson made regarding the rest of us paying Nebraskas Medicare bill forever To say I am angry is putting it mildly There is a gentleman in Fairbanks who writes in I am very skeptical about this mandatory health insurance that apparently everyone will have to buy in Here is one from a fellow in Anchorage also He says You are moving a health care bill that cant be understood unless a person has a law degree Another individual and this is an interesting one He and his family apparently own four indoor tanning businesses in Alaska We need to get a little sunshine even if it is not what God has provided us But these are good businesses and he says When did this go from a 5 percent tax increase for cosmetic surgery to 10 percent for indoor tanning anyway And he adds Adding another 10percent tax hike on small businesses like indoor tanning will likely drive many families just like mine into bankruptcy I could go on and on in terms of the stacks of correspondence and phone calls we have gotten but suffice it to say the more people understand what is in this legislation the greater their concerns are and the greater their outrage as they learn what is contained in it One of the things I learned just yesterday which I dont think we have gotten the focus or the attention onand this is a concern that was raised by the Anchorage homebuilders and the Alaska State Home Building Association They have pointed out that as an industry the homebuilders industry they are being unfairly singled out in this bill We have talked about the employer mandate that is contained in this legislation and that mandate applies to those businesses with 50 or more employees But there is a zing in this legislation to homebuilders who are now responsible for providing federally approved health benefits if they have five or more employees Look at what is going on throughout this country in terms of industries that have taken a real hit with this economic downturn and this recession The homebuilding industry has suffered incredibly during this downturn On top of depressed house prices and increases in home foreclosures now we are now going to punish them with an employer mandate that treats them worse than any other employer In other words if you have five or more employees as a homebuilder you need to know that your industry is the one the only one that will be subject to the employer mandate of 750 per employee In Alaska we checked to see how many individuals are homebuilders within the State We have about 250 homebuilders in Alaska But when you look to see how many individuals they employ that is about 3078 employees it is about 12 employees to every builder So the total homebuilding industry that would be impacted is about 800 employers in my State Yesterday there was a letter sent to Members of the Senate This is from the homebuilding industry as well as many other associated industriesthe airconditioning contractors the builders and contractors the electrical contractors I wish to mention some of the statements that are contained in this letter Again it is written yesterday They say We are writing to express our strong opposition to language contained in the managers amendment which excludes the construction industry from the small business exemption contained in the bill The fact that the managers amendment was made public less than 2 days before the first vote on the matter has increased the difficulty of playing a constructive role in the legislative process I will take a little detour from the letter This is part of the problem You have these organizations and groups and there is a list of about a dozen of them here that have signed on to this letter They had literally hours before we were forced to vote on the managers amendment They did not know what was in the bill and how it impacted them They go on to say The managers amendment singles out the construction industry by altering the exemption so it applies only to firms with fewer than 5 employees This is an unprecedented assault on our industry It is unreasonable to presume that small business owners can bear the increased costs of these new benefits simply because Congress mandates that they do so They go on to conclude in the letter We are unaware of any data or evidence that suggests that the needs and struggles of a construction contractor with fewer than 50 employees are so different from those of small business owners in other industries and absent such convincing evidence we are left to assume that this specific provision is merely a political payoff to satisfy the desires of a small constituency Those are some pretty strong words there toward the end But it does cause you to wonder why in this legislation we are going to require that businessesonly businesses in excess of 50 employees are going to be subject to this mandate Why this unprecedented assault on the homebuilders I dont get it But what it does cause me to get is that there is a heck of a lot more out there that the more we read it the more we sit down and we connect the dots the more we realize this fish we have set out on the front porch is going to continue to stink It stuns me We have the homebuilders up in Alaska who are beside themselves saying Can you take a look at this and let me know how the Senators feel What are you going to do about this Lisa is the question I have received This is something we all have to reckon with Madam President at the conclusion of my remarks I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter be printed in the Record The PRESIDING OFFICER Mrs Shaheen Without objection it is so ordered See Exhibit 1 I am going to speak a little bit about how aspects of this legislation have impact specifically on my State As a rural State sometimes the impacts we see are different than you have in more urban States Our geography is different our lack of providers our high senior population our extremely expensive costs there are a lot of dynamics at play that cause real issues and real concerns There have been many words that have been exchanged on this floor about what this bill doesnt do or what it does do I find it helpful to go to the experts the think tank in my State and ask them flat out We have an institution at the University of Alaska called the Institute of Social Economic Research I take what they have to say very seriously I also take very seriously what our Congressional Budget Office has to say what the CMS Actuary has to say because as my colleague from Florida pointed out these are the independent arbiters These are the guys whose job it is to work the numbers I would like to discuss some of the findings from the University of Alaska and also try to inject a little bit of common sense into the debate as to what it means for Alaska how it increases their premiums how it raises that cost curve on the Federal health care expenses the taxes on small businesses for the individuals the families the health benefits of the police the firefighters other public protective service people who put their lives on the line for so many These are the things about which unfortunately we might not be getting the full picture Our colleagues on the other side have claimed that health care coverage will be expanded Again lets go to our nonpartisan entitiesthe CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation The average premium per person if you purchase in the individual market is going to be 10 to 13 percent higher in 2016 than the average premium under current law That tells you if these Federal scorekeepers are correct your premiums are going to go up under this health bill if you buy insurance yourself In Alaska according to ISERagain the Institute for Social and Economic Researchyou have about 28000 Alaskans who would pay 12 percent more for their premiums It is going to cost an individual in my State an extra 1100 per year and a family in my State nearly 3000 more per year for the coverage by 2016 Again you have to ask the question Is health care expanding This bill forces you to purchase federally approved health care otherwise you have to pay the penalty of 750 or 2 percent of your income if you earn more than 37500 If you look at Alaskas population this is going to bring in more than 50 percent of Alaskas population who are going to be penalized if they fail to have health insurance Again you ask the question Is health care coverage going to be expanded Since the law we are advancing is going to require that you buy federally approved health insurance and then we are going to penalize you if you do not buy it then what you have is the heavy hand of the Federal Government that forces you to buy health insurance which is going to cost about 12 percent more once this bill is enacted12 percent more than it would today The Democrats will also talk about the hidden tax on families and how that will go away because once this bill passes under this bill everyone is going to have coverage Alaskans and all Americans who do not get federally approved health insurance that the Federal Government is going to require that you have they are going to be fined 750 2 percent of your taxable income and what the Democrats will not tell you when they say health care coverage is going to be expanded or the hidden tax is going to go away is those with income greater than 37500again affecting over 50 percent of the people in my State are going to be taxed a full 2 percent of their household income once the bill is fully phased in if they do not get health insurance It is this penalty that is going to raise 15 billion to help pay for this bill This is how we are paying for the bill CBO and CMS told us the taxes on medical deviceswhether they are tongue depressors or xrays or blood sugar metersthese are going to be passed on to the individuals so you are going to be taxed for vital medications and other health products The question you then have to ask yourself OK so do these hidden costs actually go away I suppose they do because they are no longer hidden What we will have done is we will have raised your premiums we will have increased the penalties on those earning more than 37500 who did not buy into health insurance and we will have taxed your tongue depressors and x rays to pay for the bill In addition the smallest of the small businesses are going to be taxed if they do not provide insurance for their employees and individuals and couples earning over 200000 they are going to be penalized because they are the higher income earners The Democrats are also telling you that as Medicare patients they are going to get some good positive things They will get free preventive services This is good This is absolutely great We should be encouraging preventive services But as my colleague from Florida was explaining as I mentioned after this bill passes are any of the 13I think we are down to only 12 nowprimary care doctors in Alaska in the Anchorage area anyway accepting new Medicare patients We are saying we are going to provide this service to you at no cost But again if you cant get anybody who will take you as a patient how are we helping you We have heard from a doctor in Anchorage In fact I have an opinion piece that was published just this week in the Anchorage Daily News She indicates she is dropping out of Medicare and she is doing it because of this legislation I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows From the Anchorage Daily News Dec 18 2009 OPINION Doctors and Patients Not Feds Know Best By Ilona Farr MD I have made the heartwrenching decision as a physician to opt out of Medicare I do so after working with Sen Stevens Sen Murkowski and Rep Young for a decade in hopes we could ensure seniors would be able to continue to receive medical services in Alaska On a visit costing 115 Medicare pays 40 secondary insurance pays 7 and the rest68is a loss not a tax writeoff It takes six insurance paying patient visits to offset losses from one Medicare or Medicaid patient The House health care bills HR3590HR3962 increase the number of people not paying their share of the costs and will lead doctors to opt out of Medicare or retire early Anchorage has 75 family physicians down from 180 Physician shortages like these are caused by government interference in the free market Government artificially keeps reimbursement rates low forcing other patients and insurance companies to pick up the additional costs Family practice residencies are filled with foreign medical graduates because of high costs more than 200000 associated with medical school Low physician reimbursement rates make it difficult to repay loans Medicare and Medicaid auditors are paid on commission can fine us 2000 to 50000 for one charting mistake or billing error and then extrapolate this over the practice and drive us out of business all for one minor mistake There is fraud but this system that penalizes us severely for simple errors is untenable In these bills malpractice reform is restricted health savings accounts which help reduce costs and fraud are essentially eliminated and taxes and fees on insurance and medical services are increased There are no Medicare Medicaid rate rule or audit reforms or tax writeoffs for business losses One section in Sen Harry Reids bill says Medicare will no longer pay for home health services durable medical goods and possibly labs Xrays prescriptions or other services written by providers who have opted out of Medicare Many talented physicians have had to opt out of Medicare and by this law must opt out of Medicaid and the militarys Tricare also to stay in business People will no longer be able to see these physicians because of government financial restrictions or will be forced to pay all medical bills associated with these visits themselves Bills under consideration cut Medicare spending by 460 billion raise fees on medical services increase physicians administrative burdens promote electronic medical records with mandated reporting of outcomes data and increase business costs so it will be impossible for small practices to survive My decision to withdraw from Medicare was also precipitated by US Preventive Services Task Forces recommendation that breast cancer screening mammograms should only be done on women between age 50 and 74 Approximately 48 percent of my patients with breast cancer developed it before age 50 Up to 12 percent of my practice mostly young mothers could have died if this were a national guideline The Senate bill has this task force and other committees determining what tests will be covered for patients I am concerned that penalties may be imposed on insurance companies and maybe providers for going against these guidelines The Hippocratic Oath compels us to protect the health of all humans throughout life and many provisions in these health care bills would cause us to violate that oath Physicians and patients not government should decide the best most costeffective medical treatment for patients Government should not dictate to insurance companies or providers which tests can or cannot be covered Medicine is changing too rapidly for guidelines to be made at a national level I have worked in government medical facilities and in private practice for the last 26 years Physicians provide timelier less costly and more patientoriented care if not overseen by hordes of nonproducing government administrators I am in favor of reform but current bills before Congress will collapse our health care system and work against the freedoms we are guaranteed under the Constitution Government should not be allowed to force people to purchase health insurance mandate what health care services you are allowed or increase our taxes astronomically to support a huge government health care bureaucracy that will bankrupt us as individuals and as a nation It is no secret in my State of Alaska and in far too many States around this country we do not have enough providers that will take these individuals ISER has said seniors in low payment Medicare States will be forced to wait in line Alaska is one of two Stateswe are I think second to last in terms of Medicare payments and where we stack up in relation to the reimbursement ISER goes on to state Independent of the doc fix in Alaska the remainder of seniors are at risk of long lines to see a primary care doctor and overflowing to community health center and hospital emergency rooms where existing capacity is highly likely to be quickly overwhelmed and long wait times become increasingly common ISER has also said that additional new insured patients are going to hurt Medicare beneficiaries and they state Federal healthcare reform applied to Alaska likely will exacerbate an already very challenging situation for Alaskas seniors as baby boomers age into Medicare and finding themselves waiting in line behind a rapidly expanding line of better paying private plans We are told 5 years from now our Medicare population is going to increase by 50 percent We cannot accommodate those who are Medicare eligible now Our boom is not sustainable The CMS Actuary has said The Reid bill reduces payments to health care providers which is unlikely to be sustainable on a permanent basis As a result providers could find it difficult to remain profitable and absent legislative intervention might end their participation in the Medicare program It is happening Doctors providers physicians are making those decisions as we speak They are opting out So this is not some theoretical approach to the problem This is happening Madam President how much time do we have on our side If I may ask my colleague from Kansas do I understand the Senator is seeking about 10 minutes

0230; 0231; 0232, They are using to fund the underlying bill and the underlying bill expands a variety of initiatives in the area of Medicaid and in the area of a brandnew entitlement for people who are uninsured to subsidize the government plan The CLASS Act is another classic gimmick of budgetary shenanigans which I would like to speak to briefly I know the Senator from Montana had a question or maybe he has gone past that point and we have answered all his questions I can move on to the CLASS Act The CLASS Act needs to be explained It is a great title We come up with these wonderful motherhood of titles We attach them to things and then suddenly they take on a persona that has no relationship to what they actually do The CLASS Act is a longterm care insurance program which will be government run It is another takeover of private sector activity by the Federal Government But what is extraordinarily irresponsible in this bill is we all know in longterm care insurance that you buy it when you are in your thirties and your forties You probably dont buy it when you are in your twenties You buy it in your thirties forties and fifties You start paying in premiums then But you dont take the benefits The cost of those insurance products dont incur to the insurer until people actually go into the retirement home situation which is in their late sixties and seventies most likely eighties in our culture today where many people are working well into their seventies So there is a large period of people paying in and then 30 or 40 years later they start to take out What has happened in this bill which is a classic Ponzi schemein fact ironically the chairman of the Budget Committee did call it a Ponzi scheme the Senator from North Dakota Mr Conradthey are scoring these years when people are paying into this new program and because the program doesnt exist everybody who pays into it starting with day one the beneficiaries of that program arent going to occur until probably 30 or 40 years later They are taking all the money that is paid in when people are in their thirties forties fifties and sixties as premiums They are taking that money and they are scoring it as revenue under this bill and they are spending it on other programmatic initiatives for the purposes of claiming the bill is balanced It adds up to about 212 billion over that 20year period 2010 to 2029 OK So you spend all the premium money What happens when these people do go into the nursing home do require longterm care when they become 75 80 90 years old There is no money It has been spent It has been spent on something else on a new entitlement on expanding care to people under Medicaid on whatever the bill has in it So we are going to have this huge bill that is going to come due to our kids one more time We already are sticking them with 12 trillion of debt right now and we are going to raise the debt ceiling sometime in the next month to I dont know what it is going to be but I have heard rumors it may be as high as 13 more trillion We know we have another 9 trillion of debt coming at us just by the budgets projected for the next 10 years Now we are going to 30 years from now have this huge bill come in as the people who decided to buy into the CLASS Act suddenly go into the retirement home There will not be any money there for them It is gone It will have been spent by a prior generation to make this bill balanced The CLASS Act has been described as a Ponzi scheme relative to its effect on the budget It is using dollars which should be segregated and protected under an insurance program If this were an insurance company for example they would actually have to invest those dollars in something that would be an asset which would be available to pay for the person when they go into the nursing home so they are actuarially sound But that is not what happens under this bill Under this bill those dollars go out the door as soon as they come in for the purposes of representing that this bill is in fiscal balance It is not It is not in fiscal balance obviously Even if you were to accept these incredible activities of budgetary gimmickry the fundamental problem with this bill is it grows the government by 25 trillion and we cant afford that when we already have a government that well exceeds our capacity to pay for it Inevitably we will pass on to these young pages as they go into their earning careers and raise their families a government that is so expensive they will be unable to buy a home send their kids to college or do the things they wish to do that give one a quality of life I have certainly taken more than my fair share of time at this point The Senator from Louisiana was going to go next I yield the floor Madam President it is the tradition in this body that a person seeking recognition gets recognized is it not Madam President I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of remarks of the Senator from California I be recognized President I ask unanimous consent that the next Republican speaker be the Senator from Louisiana Senator Vitter President at this point I rise to speak generally about the bill and specifically about this Medicare proposalthe proposal in the bill and the motion that has been offered by Senator MCCain which I think is an excellent idea Lets start with the size of this bill It is unusual that we would be considering a bill of this size and not have had more time to take a look at it but the bill itselfand I am glad that the chairman of the Finance Committee has essentially agreed with this earlier todaycosts 25 trillion when it is fully implemented25 trillion When my budget staff took a look at this billand we only had a brief time to do it obviously last weekand came up with that number people on the other side of the aisle said regrettably No that is a bogus number The number is 840 billion it is not a 25 trillion bill However it is 25 trillion when it is fully implemented When the programmatic activity of this bill is under full steam over a 10year period it will cost over 25 trillion That is hugehuge In an earlier colloquy I heard the chairman of the Finance Committeewho does such a good job as chairmanmake the point Well it is fully paid for It is fully paid for in each 10year period That is true literally I give him credit for that But two questions are raised by that fact The first is this Why would you expand the Federal Government by 25 trillion when we cant afford the government we have The resources that are being used to pay for this should they ever come to fruition are resources which should probably be used to make Medicare solvent or more solvent or alternatively to reduce our debt and deficit situation as we confront it as a nation We know for a fact that every year for the next 10 yearseven before this bill is put in placewe are going to run a 1 trillion deficit every year because that is what President Obama has suggested We know for a fact that our public debt is going to go from 35 percent of our gross national product up to 80 percent of our gross national product within the next 6 years without this bill being passed We know we are in a position where we are headed down a road which is basically going to hand to our children a nation that is fiscally insolvent because of the amount of debt put on their back by our generation through spending and not paying for it So why would we increase the government now by another 25 trillion when we cant afford the government we have That is the question I think we have to ask ourselves Isnt there a better way to try to address the issue of health care reform without this massive expansion of a new entitlementcreating a brandnew entitlement which is going to cost such an extraordinary amount of money and dramatically expand Medicaid which is where most of the spending comes from in this bill a massive expansion of Medicaid and a massive new entitlement created that we dont have today This bill when it is fully implemented will take the size of the Federal Government from about 20 percent of GDP or a little lesswhere it has historically been ever since the postWorld War II periodup to about 24 or 25 percent of GDP To accomplish that and claim you are not going to increase the deficit requires a real leap of faith Because it means that to pay for thisand this is why the MCCain motion is so importantyou are going to have to reduce Medicare spending by 1 trillion when this bill is fully implemented1 trillion over a 10year window In fact during the period from 2010 to 2029 Medicare spending will be reduced in this bill by 3 trillion Those dollars will not be used to make Medicare more solvent And we know we have serious problems with Medicare Those dollars will be used to create a brandnew entitlement and to dramatically increase the size of government for people who do not pay into the hospital insurance fund for people who have not paid Medicare taxes for the most part but rather for a whole new population of people going under expanded Medicaid and people getting this new entitlement under the public plan So if you are going to reduce Medicare spending in the first 10 years by 450 billion and the second 10 years fully implementedthere is some overlap there but fully implemented 1 trillion and then over a 19year period the two decades by 3 trillion instead of using those moniesthose seniors dollarsto try to make Medicare more solvent they are going to be used for the purposes of expanding and creating a new entitlement and expanding Medicaid This is hard to accept as either being fair to our senior population or being good policy from a fiscal standpoint Why is that Because if we look at the Medicare situation we know Medicare as it is structured today has an unfunded liability of 55 trillion55 trillion That means in the Medicare system we do not know how we are going to pay 55 trillion worth of benefits we know we are now obligated for The answer we get from the other side of the aisle is Well this 55 trillion number goes down because this bill cuts Medicare and therefore the benefit structure reduces But do the revenues or the reduction in that go toward the purpose of making Medicare more solvent No Those monies are taken and spent Those monies are taken and used to create a larger government They arent used to reduce the deficit or to reduce the debt all of which is being driven in large part by this 55 trillion worth of unfunded liability as we go forward No they are being used to create a brandnew entitlement which has nothing to do with seniors and a brandnew entitlement which is going to be paid for in large part by seniors or by a reduction in their benefit structure That makes very little sense because essentially you are taking money out of the Medicare system and using it to expand the government when in fact what we should be doing if you are going to take money out of the Medicare system is you should be using it to reduce the obligations of the governmentthe debt obligationso the Medicare system becomes more affordable That is not the goal here however Then of course there is the practical aspect of this We know these types of proposals are plug numbers to a great degree because we know this Congress is not going to stand up to a 12 trillion cut in Medicare over the next 10 years and a 3 trillion cut in Medicare over the next 20 years Why do we know that I know it from personal experience I was chairman of the Budget Committee the last time we tried to address the fact that we have an outyear liability in Medicare that is not affordablethis 55 trillion number We know it is not affordable We know we have to do something about it So I suggested when I was chairman of the Budget Committee that we reduce Medicare spending or its rate of growthnot actual spending its rate of growthby 10 billion over a 5year period less than 1 percent of Medicare spending My suggestion was that we do that by requiring primarily we get most of that money by requiring senior citizens who are wealthy to pay a reasonable proportion of their Part D premium and then take those moneys and basically try to make Medicare a little more solvent with it We got no votes from the other side of the aisle none zeroon that proposal Now they come forward with a representation that they are going to reduce Medicare spending and benefits to seniors by 3 trillion over the next 20 years and 400someodd billion over the next 10 years and they expect this to be taken seriously Of course not This is all going to end up being unpaidfor expenditures in expansion of these programs These brandnew entitlements that are being put in this bill and this expansion of other entitlements that do not deal with Medicare by the way are going to end up being in large part paid for by creating more debt and passing it on to our children As I mentioned earlier that is a fairly big problem for our kids They are going to get a country as it is today that has about 70 trillion in unfunded liability just in the Medicare and Medicaid accounts to say nothing of the other deficits we are running up around here Now we are going to throw another huge amount on their backs Some percentage of this 25 trillionprobably a majority of it will end up being added to the deficit and debt as we move out into the outyears even though it is represented that it is not going to be The only way you can claim you are going to pay for this of course is with these Medicare cuts and these tax increases that are in this bill and these fee increases We are going to spend a little time on the tax increases and fee increases and the speciousness of those proposals but right now we are focusing on Medicare In any event what we have is a bill that takes government and explodes its size We already have a government that is pretty big20 percent of our economy You are exploding it to 24 percent of our economy and then you are saying you are going to pay for that by dramatically reducing Medicare spending It does not make any philosophical sense and it certainly does not pass the test of what happens around here politically In addition there is the issue of how this bill got to a score in the first 10 years that made it look as if it was more fiscally responsible I have heard people from the other side Again I respect the chairman of the Finance Committee for acknowledging that this bill when fully implemented is a 25 trillion bill But a lot of folks are claiming this is just an 843 billion bill that is all it is in the first 10 years that is all it costs There are so many major budget gimmicks in this bill that accomplish that score that Bernie Madoff would be embarrassedembarrassed by what this bill does in the area of gamesmanship Lets start with the fact that it begins most of the fees most of the taxes and most of the Medicare cuts in the first year of the 10 years but it does not begin the spending on the new program the new entitlements until the fourth and fifth year So they are matching 4 and 5 years of spending against 10 years of income and Medicare cuts and claiming that therefore there is a balance Ironically it is represented and rumoredand I admit this is a rumorthat originally they were going to start the spending in the third year under this bill Of course nobody knew what the bill was because it was written in private and nobody got to see it But then they got a score from CBO that said it didnt work that way so they simply moved the spending back a year and started it in the fourth year They sent it back to CBO and CBO said If you take a year of spending out in the 10 years and you still have the 10 years of income from the taxes fees and cuts in Medicare you get a better score We will give you a better score You will get closer to balance It is a pretty outrageous little game of hide the pea under the shell This is probably the single biggestin my experience and I have been on the Budget Committee for quite a whilein my experience it is the single biggest gaming of the budget system I have ever seen around here But it is not the only one there is something here called the CLASS Act I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Utah for purposes of a question It is about 16 to 17 percent of our gross national product It takes the spending from 16 to 17 percent to about 20 percent of GDP The Senator from Utah of course being a senior member of the Finance Committee is very familiar with those numbers and that is absolutely correct I think that is the biggest in the context of what it generates in the way of Pyrrhic nonexistent savings because it basically says we are really not spendingbecause it doesnt fully implement the plan in the first year it says we are not spending that much money In fact we know that when the plan is fully implemented it is a 245 trillion not a 840 billion bill If I can first answer the question of the Senator from Utah and then I will be happy to answer the chairman of the Finance Committee The Senator from Utah basically is correct in his assumption Essentially they are claiming an approximately 400someodd billion savings in Medicare over 10 years which they are then using to finance the spending in this bill over the last 5 years 5 to 6 years of the 10year window In the end after you fully implement this bill and you fully implement the Medicare cuts it represents 3 trillion of Medicare reductions over a 20year period Where does it come from It comes from two different accounts primarily One is just about anybody who is on Medicare Advantage todayabout 25 percent of those people will probably completely lose their Medicare Advantage insurance and it is 12000 people in New Hampshire so say 4000 people About 25 percent of those people will lose their Medicare insurance under this proposal mostly in rural areas And second because there is 160 billion of savings scored You cant save that type of money in Medicare Advantage unless people dont get the Medicare Advantage advantage Second it comes in significant reductions in provider payments How do provider payments get paid for when they are cut I ask the Senator from Utah I suspect it is because less health care is provided It certainly affects the hospitals and it probably affects the doctors I have heard the Senator from Montana say they are going to straighten out the doctor problem down the road but that is another 250 billion of spending which we dont know where they are going to get the money from But yes it would affect in my opinion all providersdoctors hospitals and other people who provide health care to seniors You cannot take 450 billion out of the Medicare system and not affect peoples Medicare The Medicare system is headed toward insolvency and it goes cashnegative in 2013 I believemaybe it is 2012in the sense that it is paying out less than it takes in and it has an unfunded liability that exceeds actually 38 trillion now I think it is up around I think the Senator from Utah has asked one of the core questions about this bill Why would you use Medicare savings reductions in Medicare benefits which will definitely affect recipients for the purposes of creating a new program rather than for the purposes of making health care more solvent if you are going to do that in the first place And are these savings ever going to really come about One wonders about that also Actually I would yield to the Senator from Utah on that issuenot the floor but yield on that question because I think the Senator from Utah was there when Medicare Advantage was drafted as a law I believe it is a legal part of Medicare Medicare Advantage And this would have a massively disruptive effect on people who get Medicare Advantage because you are going to reduce it the scoring is there will be a reduction in Medicare Advantage payments of approximately 162 billion I believe it is and there is no way you are going to keep getting the advantages of Medicare Advantage if you have that type of reduction in payments If the Senator will allow me to respond the problem here is we have rolled the Medicare issue into this major health reform billor the other side hasand they have used Medicare as a piggy bank for the purposes of trying to create a brandnew entitlement which has nothing to do with senior citizens Yes Medicare needs to be addressed It needs to be reformed The benefit structure probably has to be reformed But we should not use those dollars for the purposes of expanding the government with a brandnew entitlement We should use those dollars to shore up Medicare so we dont have this massive insolvency

yield What is the current cost of our health care across the board in this country without this bill 5 trillion The Senator is saying they are going to add if you extrapolate it out over another 10 years 25 trillion If I understand my colleague correctly he is saying to reach this outlandish figure of 843 billion literally they do not implement the program until 2014 and even beyond that to a degree but they do implement the tax increases Is that one of the budget gimmicks my colleague is talking about You mean they are not using this 500 billion to shore up Medicare and to help it during this period of possible insolvency with a 38 trillion unfunded liability They are not using it for that purpose Am I correct that the Democrats have saidand they seem to be unified on this billthat literally this bill is budget neutral But as I understand it in order to get to the budget neutrality they are socking it to a program that has about 38 trillion in unfunded liabilities called Medicareto the tune of almost 500 billion or 1 2 trillion in order to pay for this Am I correct on that No 2 who is going to lose out when they start taking 500 billion out of Medicare And what are they going to do with that 500 billion Are they going to put it into something else Are they using this just as a budgetary gimmick What is happening here As the ranking member on the Budget Committee today you really could help all of us understand this better How many people on Medicare are on Medicare Advantage That will be what percentage of people on Medicare How does that affect the doctors Am I wrong in saying Medicare is already headed toward insolvency and that it has up to almost 38 trillion in unfunded liability over the years for our young people to have to pay for Then how can our friends on the other side take 12 trillion out of Medicare which is headed toward insolvency to use for some programs they want to now institute anew I heard someone say today on the floorI dont know who it was I cant rememberthat Medicare Advantage really isnt part of Medicare Is that true I was there in the Medicare modernization conference along with the distinguished chairman of the committee Senator Baucus and others when we did that because we were not getting health care to rural America The MedicareChoice plan didnt work Doctors would not take patients Hospitals could not pay they could not take patients There were all kinds of difficulties in rural America So we did Medicare Advantage and all of a sudden we were able to take care of those people Yes it costs a little more but that is because we went into the rural areas to do it But this would basically decimate Medicare Advantage wouldnt it what is being proposed here And that is part of Medicare How can they take 12 trillion out of Medicare That is not all Medicare Advantage Medicare Advantage is only part of that the deductions they will make there But how can they do that and still run Medicare in a solvent constructive decent and honorable fashion For what purpose are they using it There is no question he is a great Senator I have always enjoyed working with him and we have done an awful lot together I want to compliment Senator Whitehouse too a terrific human being and great addition to this Senate and I have a lot of respect for him He gives me heartburn from time to time as does Senator Dodd On the other hand they are great people and very sincere Our chairman of the committee Max Baucus is a wonderful man He is trying to do the best he can under the circumstances I applaud him for it Senator Stabenow from Michigan and I have not seen eye to eye on a lot of things but we always enjoy being around each other This is a great place there is no question about it We have great people here But that doesnt make us any less unhappy about what we consider to be an awful bill But right now today let me talk about a few specific things Today the senior Senator from Illinois came to the floor and spoke about my efforts to reduce the costs associated with medical malpractice liability I dont think his statement should go unanswered Not only were a number of his statements simply incorrect as factual matters but some of them even bordered on being offensive I am not offended I can live with it I can take criticism but some of them I think were a little bit over the top First of all he referred to the recent letter I received from the CBO which indicated that the government would realize significant savings by enacting some simple tort reform measures I dont know anybody in America who has any brains who doesnt realize we have to do something about tort reform when it comes to health care According to the CBO these measures would reduce the deficit by 54 billion over 10 years That is a lot of money Private sector savings would be even more significant According to the CBO we would likely see a reduction of roughly 125 billion in private health care spending over the same 10year period and that in my view is a low estimate Democrats apparently want the American people to think these numbers are so insignificant that this issue should be ignored in this health care bill and I have to respectfully disagree I may be one of the few Senators in this body who actually tried medical malpractice cases I actually defended them I defended doctors hospitals nurses health care practitioners I understand them There are cases where there should be huge recoveries I would be the first to admit it I saw the wrong eye taken out the wrong leg taken off the wrong kidney You only have two of each of those You bet your bottom dollar we settled those for significant amounts of money But I also saw that the vast majority of the cases were frivolous brought to get the defense costs which then only ranged from 50000 to 200000 depending on the jurisdiction If a lawyer can get a number of those cases they can make a pretty good living by bringing those cases just to get the defense costs which of course adds to all the costs of health care There is no use kidding about it Furthermore Senator Durbin the distinguished Senator from Illinois cited the same CBO letter in order to claim that the tort reform measures supported by many on my side of the aisle would cause more people to die Give me a break I can only assume he is referring to the one paragraph in the CBO letter that addresses the effect of tort reform on health outcomes In that single paragraph the CBO referred to three studies One of these studies indicated that a reduction in malpractice lawsuits would lead to an increase in mortality ratesone of the three The other two studies cited by the CBO found that there would be no effects on health outcomes and no negative effects could be expected So lets be clear the CBO did not reach a conclusion in this case These studies were cited only to show that there is disagreement in this area and once again the majority of the studies cited said there would be no negative effects on health outcomes Apparently omitting data and studies that disagree with your conclusions is becoming common practice among policy makers these days In his speech earlier today the distinguished Senator from Illinois also discounted the prominence of defensive medicine in our health care system saying only that some doctors perform unnecessary and inappropriate procedures in order to avoid lawsuits Once again the facts would contradict this generalization A number of studies demonstrate this For example a 2005 study of 800 Pennsylvania physicianswhere I used to practice lawin highrisk specialties found that 93 percent of these physicians had practiced some form of defensive medicine That was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association June 1 2005 In addition a 2002 nationwide survey of 300 physiciansthis is the Harris Interactive Fear of Litigation Studyfound that 79 percent of physicians ordered more tests than are necessary Think about that If 79 percent are ordering more tests than are necessary you can imagine the multibillions of dollars in unnecessary defensive medicine that comes from that But that is not the end of that Fear of Litigation Study Seventyfour percent of physicians referred patients to specialists who in their judgment did not need any such referral Think about itreferring people to specialists that they knew they didnt need Think of the cost the billions of dollars in cost Fiftytwo percent of physicians suggested unnecessary invasive procedures The word invasive is an important word Fiftytwo percent Why Because they are trying to protect themselves by making sure that everything could possibly be done Fortyone percent of physicians prescribed unnecessary medications This is a nationwide survey of 300 physicians The costs associated with defensive medicine are realI would say unnecessary defensive medicine because I believe there are some defensive medicine approaches that we would want the doctors to do but not to the extent of these doctors ordering more tests than are necessary ordering more specialists than are necessary suggesting unnecessary invasive procedures unnecessary medications This is the medical profession itself that admits this In another study Pricewaterhouse found that defensive medicine accounts for approximately 210 billion every year or 10 percent of the total US health care cost Here are some more facts from the Pricewaterhouse study Of the 22 trillion spent every year on health care in the United States as much as 12 trillion can be attributed to wasteful spending12 trillion of 22 trillion Yet the Democrats want to deny that unnecessary defensive medicine is being utilized to a significant extent According to this study defensive medicine is the largest single area of waste in the health care system It is on par with inefficient claim processing and care spent on preventable conditions Yet despite these overwhelming numbersand I know some Democrats will say that is Pricewaterhouse and they must have been doing it at the expense of somebody who had an interest Pricewaterhouse and other accounting firms generally try to get it right They got it right here Those of us who were in that business can attest to it Yet despite these overwhelming numbers my friends on the other side have opted to overlook them and instead relate horrific stories associated with doctors malpractice apparently trying to imply that Republicans simply dont care about these truly tragic occurrences However nothing could be further from the truth In fact in all the proposals that have been offered during this debate there has not been a single suggestion to prevent plaintiffs from obtaining the compensation for actual losses they have incurred not one suggestion that they should Instead we have sought to impose some limits on the noneconomic damages All economic damages damages awarded for actual loss past present and futureare fine fair game Weve sought only impose some limits on the noneconomic damages in order to define the playing field encourage settlement and introduce some level of predictability to the system It is no secret that personal injury lawyerssome of themare prolific political contributors to those politicians who fight against tort reform With a Democratic majority and a Democrat in the White House their lobbying efforts during this Congress have reached unprecedented levels Given this reality it is obvious why trial lawyers have not been asked to give up anything in the current health care legislation Supporters of this health care bill will be asking the American people to pay higher health care premiums for seniors to give up Medicare Advantage which 25 percent of them have enlisted in for businesses to pay higher taxes for medical device manufacturers to pay more just to bring a device to the market that may save lives or make lives more worth living The only group that has not been asked to sacrifice or change the way they do business happens to be the medical liability personal injury lawyers I would hope we would focus our efforts more on helping the American people than on preserving a fundraising stream for politicians Sadly that doesnt appear to be happening in the current debate As I said there are some very honest and decent attorneys out there who bring cases that are legitimate where there should be high rewards But the vast majority I can personally testify are less than legitimate and the resulting costs are costing every American citizen an arm and a leg It is something we ought to resolve We ought to resolve it in a way that takes care of those who truly have injuries and get rid of these frivolous cases driving up the cost for every American Not too long ago I talked to one of the leading heart specialists in Washington He acknowledged we all order a lot of tests and so forth that we dont need that we know we dont need But we do it so that the history we have of the patient shows we did everything possible to rule out everything that possibly could occur even though we know we dont need to do it To be honest under the current system of lawsuits I dont blame them They are trying to protect themselves We should also discuss the shortage of doctors we have going into highrisk specialties We have areas in this country where you cant get obstetricians and gynecologists to the people Law schools will tell you at least the ones I know that there arent that many young people going into obstetrics and gynecology today because they may not make as much money and the high cost of medical liability insurance is so high that they really cant afford to do it And of course they dont want to get sued So much for that I love my distinguished friend from Illinois and he knows it I care for him But let me tell you I think he knows better He knows that I know better I would be the first to come to bat for somebody who was truly injured because of the negligence of a physician I dont have any problem with that at all I just thought I would make a few comments about this but again say that I understand some of the excesses that go on on the floor But that was an excess this morning even though I know my dear friend is sincere and dedicated and one of the better lawyers in this body Having said that I will end on that particular subject Let me once again take a few minutes to talk about the Medicare provisions in this Democratic Party health care bill Throughout the health care debate we have heard the President pledge not to mess with Medicare Unfortunately that is not the case with the bill before the Senate To be clear the Reid bill reduces Medicare by 465 billion to fund a new government program Unfortunately seniors and the disabled in the United States are the ones who suffer the consequences as a result of these reductions Everyone knows Medicare is extremely important to 43 million seniors and disabled Americans covered by the Medicare Program Throughout my Senate service I have fought to preserve and protect Medicare for both beneficiaries and providers Medicare is already in trouble today The program faces tremendous challenges in the very near future The Medicare trust fund will be insolvent by 2017 and the program has more than 37 trillion in unfunded liabilities This is going to be saddled onto our children and grandchildren The Reid bill will make the situation much worse Why is that the case Again the Reid bill cuts Medicare to fund the creation of a new government entitlement program More specifically the Reid bill will cut nearly 135 billion from hospitalswhere are they going to get this money120 billion from Medicare Advantage almost 15 billion from nursing homes more than 40 billion from home health care agencies and close to 8 billion from hospice providers These cuts will threaten beneficiary access to care as Medicare providers find it more and more challenging to provide health services to Medicare patients Many doctors are not taking Medicare patients now because of low reimbursement rates Let me stress to my colleagues that cutting Medicare to pay for a new government entitlement program is irresponsible Any reductions to Medicare should be used to preserve the program not to create a new government bureaucracy As I just said the President has consistently pledged We are not going to mess with Medicare Once again this is another example of a straightforward pledge that has been broken over the last 11 months Maybe you cannot blame the President because he is not sitting in this body The body is breaking it This bill strips more than 120 billion out of the Medicare Advantage Program that currently covers 106 million seniors or almost one out of four seniors in the Medicare Program According to the Congressional Budget Office under this bill the value of the socalled additional benefits such as vision care and dental care will decline from 135 to 42 by 2019 That is a reduction of more than 70 percent in benefits You heard me right 70 percent During the Finance Committees consideration of health care reform I offered an amendment to protect these benefits for our seniors many of whom are lowincome Americans and reside in rural States and rural areas However the majority party would not support this important amendment The majority chose to skirt the Presidents pledge about no reduction in Medicare benefits for our seniors by characterizing the benefits being lostvision care dental care and reduced hospital deductiblesas extra benefits Let me make the point as clearly as I can When we promise American seniors we will not reduce their benefits lets be honest about that promise So we are either going to protect benefits or not It is that simple Under this bill if you are a senior who enjoys Medicare Advantage the unfortunate answer is no they are not going to protect your benefits All day today we had Members on the other side of the aisle claim that Medicare Advantage is not part of Medicare This is absolutelyI have to tell you it is absolutely unbelievable I would invite every Member making this claim to turn to page 50 of the 2010 Medicare and You Handbook It says A Medicare Advantage is another health coverage choice you may have Get these words as part of Medicare Let me repeat that A Medicare Advantage is another health coverage choice you may have as part of Medicare Hey that is the Medicare 2010 Medicare and You Handbook Who is kidding whom about it not being part of Medicare So the bottom line is simple If you are cutting Medicare Advantage benefits you are cutting Medicare I also heard the distinguished Senator from Connecticut this morning mention that the bureaucratcontrolled Medicare Commission will not cut benefits in Part A and Part B Well once again my friends on the other side are only telling you half the story So much for transparency On page 1005 of this bill it states in plain English Include recommendations to reduce Medicare payments under C and D I am just waiting for Members on the other side of the aisle to come down and now claim that Part D is also not a part of Medicare We all know it is It is also important to note that the Director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has told us in clear terms that this unfettered authority given to the Medicare Commission would result in higher premiums It is important details such as these that the majority does not want us to discuss and debate in full view of the American people They call it slowwalking They call it obstructionism Making sure we take enough time to discuss a 2074page bill that will affect every American life and every American business is the sacred duty of every Senator in this Chamber We will take as long as it takes to fully discuss this bill and you can talk for a month about various parts of this bill that are outrageous and some that are really good too in all fairnessnot many however I have heard several Members from the other side of the aisle characterize the Medicare Advantage Program as a giveaway to the insurance industry You know when you cannot win an argument you start blaming somebody else So they want a government insurance company to take the place of the insurance industry Well maybe that is too much They want it to compete with the insurance industry But how do you compete with a governmentsponsored entity And there are comments that the socalled government plan will cost more than the current insurance businesses they are so criticizing I am not happy with the insurance industry either but by gosh lets be fair Let me give everyone watching at home a little history lesson on the creation of Medicare Advantage I served as a member of the House Senate conference committee which wrote the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 The distinguished Senator from Montana would agree with me it was months of hard slogging work every day to try to come up with the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 Among other things this law created the Medicare Advantage Program It gives people vision care dental care et cetera When conference committee members were negotiating the conference report back then in 2003 several of us insisted that the Medicare Advantage Program was necessary in order to provide health care coverage choices to Medicare beneficiaries At that time there were many parts of the country where Medicare beneficiaries did not have adequate choices in coverage In fact the only choice offered to them was traditional feeforservice Medicare a onesizefitsall governmentrun health program By creating the Medicare Advantage Program we were providing beneficiaries with choice in coverage and then empowering them to make their own health care decisions as opposed to the Federal Government making them for them Today every Medicare beneficiary may choose from several health plans We learned our lessons from MedicareChoice which was in effect at the time and its predecessors These plans collapsed especially in rural areas because Washington decided again government got involvedto set artificially low payment rates In fact in my home State of Utah all of the MedicareChoice plans eventually ceased operations because they were all operating in the red You cannot continue to do that It was really stupid what we were expecting them to do I fear history could repeat itself if we are not careful During the Medicare Modernization Act conference we fixed the problem We increased reimbursement rates so all Medicare beneficiaries regardless of where they livedbe it Fillmore UT or New York Cityhad choice in coverage Again we did not want beneficiaries stuck with a onesizefitsall Washingtonrun government plan There were both Democrats and Republicans on that committee by the way and the leader was of course the distinguished Senator from Montana I admire him for the way he led it and I admire him for trying to present what I think is the most untenable case here on the floor during this debate He is a loyal Democrat He is doing the best he can and he deserves a lot of credit for sitting through all those meetings and all of that markup and everything else and sitting dayin and dayout on the floor here Today Medicare Advantage works Every Medicare beneficiary has access to a Medicare Advantage plan if they so choose and close to 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries participating in the program are satisfied with their health coverage But that can all change should this health care reform legislation currently being considered become law In States such as Utah Idaho Colorado New Mexicojust to mention some Western StatesWyoming Montanayou can name every Staterural America was not well served and we did Medicare Advantage Choice in coverage has made a difference in the lives of more than 10 million Americans nationwidealmost 11 million Americans The so called extra benefits I mentioned earlier are being portrayed as gym memberships as opposed to lower premiums copayments and deductibles To be clear the Silver Sneakers Program is one that has made a difference in the lives of many seniors because it encourages them to get out of their homes and remain active It is prevention at its best It has been helpful to those with serious weight issues and it has been invaluable to women suffering from osteoporosis and joint problems In fact I have received several hundred letters telling me how much Medicare Advantage beneficiaries appreciate this program They benefit from it Their lives are better They use health care less They do not milk the system They basically have a better chance of living and living in greater health Throughout these debates throughout these markups throughout these hearings that have led us to this point every health care bill I know of has a prevention and wellness section in the bill that will encourage things such as the Silver Sneakers Program that has benefited senior citizens so much and was not one of the major costs of Medicare Advantage Additionally these beneficiaries receive other services such as coordinated chronic care management which is important coordinated chronic care management for seniors dental coveragereally important for lowincome seniors vision carecan you imagine how important that is to people over 60 years of age How about those who are over 70 or 80 years of age And hearing aidscan you imagine how important that is to our senior citizens This program helps these seniors and it helps them the right way Let me read some letters from my constituents These are real lives being affected by the cuts contemplated in the bill Remember there is almost 500 billion cut by this bill from Medicare which goes insolvent by 2017 and has an almost 38 trillion unfunded liability Let me read this letter from a constituent from Layton UT I recently received my healthcare updater for 2010 I am in a Med Advantage plan with Blue CrossBlue Shield Thanks to the cuts in this program by Medicare my monthly premiums have risen by 49 and my office visit copay has increased 150 Senator Hatch I am on a fixed income and this has really presented a problem for me and many others I know on the same program And at my age I certainly cant find a job that would help cover the gap I worked all my life to enjoy my retirement and thanks to the current economy Ive lost a lot of those monies that were intended to help supplement my income This letter is from a constituent from Logan UT where the great Utah State University is Please stop the erosion of Medicare Advantage for seniors Very many of us are already denied proper medical and dental care not to mention those who cannot afford needed medications Hardest hit are ones on Social Security who are just over the limit for extra help but cannot keep up with the rising medical costs that go way beyond the socalled cost of living increases which we are not getting this year anyway If those in government who make these decisions had to live as we do day to day I think we would find better conditions for seniors The difference in decision making changes when you are hungry and cold your own self Here is a constituent from Pleasant Grove UT Please do not phase out the Medicare Advantage program senior citizens need it Our supplement insurance rates go up every year and our income does not keep pace with the cost of living Here is a constituent from Salt Lake City UT We met with our insurance agent this morning about the increased costs of our Medicare Advantage plans due to the health care reform bill now before Congress Our premium costs have already been significantly increased with the coverage substantially decreased We are in our 80s and cannot afford these increases and are hurt by the decreased coverage We are writing to you to have you stop the cuts and restore the coverage to Medicare Advantage plans This is an issue that is very important and very real to us at this point in our lives Please stop the cuts and restore coverage I cant support any bill that would jeopardize health care coverage for Medicare beneficiaries I truly believe if this bill before the Senate becomes law Medicare beneficiaries health care coverage could be in serious trouble I have been in the Senate for over 30 years33 to be exact I pride myself on being bipartisan I have coauthored many bipartisan health care bills since I first joined the Senate in 1977 Almost everyone in this Chamber wants a health care reform bill to be enacted this year I dont know of anybody on either side who would not like to get a health care bill enacted On our side we would like to do it in a bipartisan way but this bill is certainly not bipartisan It hasnt been from the beginning We want it to be done right History has shown that to be done right it needs to be a bipartisan bill that passes the Senate with a minimum of 75 to 80 votes We did it in 2003 when we considered the Medicare prescription drug legislation and I believe we can do it again today if we have the will and if we get rid of the partisanship I doubt there has ever been a bill of this magnitude affecting so many American lives that has passed this Chamber on an almostor maybe in a completestraight partyline vote The Senate is not the House of Representatives This body has a different constitutional mandate than the House We are the deliberative body We are the body that has in the past and should today be working through these difficult issues to find clear consensus True bipartisanship is what is needed In the past the Senate has approved many bipartisan health care bills that have eventually been signed into law I know a lot of them have been mine along with great colleagues on the other side who deserve the credit as well The Balanced Budget Act in 1997 included the HatchKennedy SCHIP program How about the Ryan White Act I stood right here on the Senate floor and called it the Ryan White bill His mother was sitting in the audience at the time How about the Orphan Drug Act When I got here we found that there were only two or three orphan drugs being developed These are drugs for population groups of less than 250000 people It is clear that the pharmaceutical companies could not afford to do the pharmaceutical work to come up with treatments or cures for orphan conditions So we put some incentives in there we put some tax benefits in there We did some things that were unique If I recall it correctly it was about a 14 million bill Today we have over 300 orphan drugs some of which have become blockbuster drugs along the line They wouldnt have been developed if it hadnt been for that little tiny orphan drug bill That was a major bill when I was chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee They now call it the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee How about the Americans With Disabilities Act Tom Harkin stood there I stood here and we passed that bill through the Senate It wasnt easy There were people who thought it was too much Federal Government too much this too much that But Senator Harkin and I believedas did a lot of Democrats and a lot of Republicans as the final vote showedthat we should take care of persons with disabilities if they would meet certain qualifications How about the HatchWaxman Act We passed that Henry Waxman a dear friend of mine one of the most liberal people in all of the House of Representatives and who is currently the very powerful chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee over there we got together put aside our differences and we came up with HatchWaxman which basically almost everybody admits created the modern generic drug industry By the way most people will admit that bill has saved at least 10 billion to consumers and more today by the way every year since 1984 I could go on and on but let me just say I have worked hard to try and bring our sides together so we can in a bipartisan way do what is right for the American people Let me just tell my colleagues if the Senate passes this bill in its current form with a razor thin margin of 60 votes this will become one more example of the arrogance of power being exerted since the Democrats secured a 60vote majority in the Senate and took over the House and the White House There are essentially no checks or balances found in Washington today just an arrogance of power with one party ramming through unpopular and devastating proposals such as this one after another Well let me say there is a better way to handle health care reform For months I have been pushing for a fiscally responsible and stepby step proposal that recognizes our current need for spending restraint while starting us on a path to sustainable health care reform There are several areas of consensus that can form the basis for sustainable fiscally responsible and bipartisan reform These include Reforming the health insurance market for every American by making sure no American is denied coverage simply based on a preexisting condition Some of my colleagues on the other side have tried to blast the insurance industry saying they are an evil powerful industry We need to reform them no question about it and we can do it if we work together Protecting the coverage for almost 85 percent of Americans who already have coverage they like by making that coverage more affordable This means reducing costs by rewarding quality and coordinated care giving families more information on the cost and choices of their coverage and treatment options andI said it earlierdiscouraging frivolous lawsuits that have permeated our society and made the lives of a high percentage of our doctors especially in those very difficult fields of medicine painful and those fields not very popular to go into today And of course we could promote prevention and wellness measures We could give States flexibility to design their own unique approaches to health care reform Utah is not New York Colorado is not New Jersey New York is not Utah and New Jersey is not Colorado Each State has its own demographics and its own needs and its own problems Why dont we get the people who know those States best to make health care work I know the legislators closer to the people are going to be very responsive to the people in their respective States I admit some States might not do very well but most of them would do much better than what we will do here with some big albatross of a bill that really does not have bipartisan support Actually in talking about New York what works in New York will most likely not work in Colorado let alone Utah As we move forward on health care reform it is important to recognize that every State has its own unique mix of demographics Each State has developed its own institutions to address its challenges and each has its own successes We can have 50 State laboratories determining how to do health care in this country in accordance with their own demographics and we could learn from the States that are successful We could learn from the States that make mistakes We could learn from the States that cross breed ideas We could make insurance so that it crosses State lines Can you imagine what that would do to costs We could do it But there is no desire to do that today with this partisan bill There is an enormous reservoir of expertise experience and field tested reform We should take advantage of that by placing States at the center of health care reform efforts so they can use approaches that best reflect their needs and their challenges My home State of Utah has taken important and aggressive steps toward sustainable health care reform They already have an exchange They are trying some very innovative things By anybodys measure the State of Utah has a pretty good health care system Is it perfect No But we could help it to be with a fraction of the Federal dollars that this bill is going to cost This bill over 10 years is at least 25 trillion and I bet my bottom dollar it will be over 3 trillion That is on top of 24 trillion we are already spending half of which they claim may be not well spent We know a large percentage of that is not well spent Like I say my home State of Utah has taken important and aggressive steps toward sustainable health care reform The current efforts to introduce the defined contribution health benefits system and implement the Utah health exchange are laudable accomplishments A vast majority of AmericansI believe this to be really trueagree a onesizefitsall Washington government solution is not the right approach That is why seniors and everybody else except a very few are up in arms about these bills That is what this bill is bound to force on us a onesizefitsall Washingtonrun controlled government program I am not just talking about the government option That is a small part of the argument today If we pass this bill we will have Washington governing all of our lives with regard to health care I cant think of a worse thing to do when I look at the mess they have made with some very good programs Unfortunately the path we are taking in Washington right now is to simply spend another 25 trillion of taxpayer money to further expand the role of the Federal Government I just wish the majority would take a step back keep their arrogance of power in check and truly work on a real bipartisan bill that all of us can be proud of They have the media with them selling this bill as less than 1 trillion Give me a break Between now and 2014 yes they will charge everybody the taxes they can get and the costs they can get but the bill isnt implemented until 2014 and even some aspects not until 2015 That is the only way with that budgetary gimmick they could get the costs to allegedly be down below 900 billion But even the CBOcertainly the Senate Budget Committeeacknowledges that if you extrapolateI think my colleagues on the other side acknowledge that if you extrapolate it out over a full 10 years you have at least 25 trillion and in some circumstances as much as 3 trillion How can we justify that With the problems we have today a 12 trillion national debt going up to 17 trillion if we do things like this How can we justify it How can we stick our kids and our grandkids and our great grandkidsmy wife and I have all three by the way kids grandkids and greatgrandkids How can we stick them with the cost of this bill This is just one bill I hate to tell you some of the other things that are being put forth in not only this body but the other How come we do it on bills that are totally partisan bills If we look at what has happened the HELP Committee the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee came up with a totally partisan bill Not one Republican was asked to contribute to it They just came up with what they wanted to do It was led by one staff on Capitol Hill It is a very partisan bill Then the House came up with their bill Not one Republican to my knowledge had even been asked to help and it is a tremendously partisan billboth of which are tremendously costly too Then the distinguished Senator from Montana tried to come up with a bill that would be bipartisan in the Finance Committee but in the end even with the Gang of 6and I was in the original Gang of 7 but I couldnt stay because I knew what the bottom bill was going to be and I knew I couldntI couldnt support it So I voluntarily left not because I wanted to cause any problems but because I didnt want to cause any problems I found myself coming out of those meetings and decrying some of the ideas that were being pushed in those meetings I just thought it was the honorable thing to do to absent myself from the Gang of 7 It became a Gang of 6 and then the three Republicans finally concluded that they couldnt support it either But I will give the distinguished chairman from Montana a great deal of credit because he sat through all of that He worked through all of it He worked through it in the committee but then it became a partisan exercise in committee by and large Yes there were a couple of amendments accepted My gosh look at that Then what happened They went to the majority leaders office in the Senate and they brought the HELP bill and the bill from the Finance Committee and they molded this bill this 2074page bill with the help of the White House Not one Republican I know of had anything to do with it although I know my dear friend the distinguished majority leader did from time to time talk with at least one Republican but only on as far as I could see one or two very important issues in the bill There are literally thousands of important issues in this bill not just one or two There are some that are more important than others but they are all important I am not willing to saddle the American people with this costly overly expensive bureaucratic nightmare this bill will be I hope my colleagues on the other side will listen and I hope we can start over on a stepbystep approach that takes in the needs of the respective States that is not a onesizefitsall solution that both Republicans and Democrats can work on which will literally follow the principles of federalism and get this done in a way that all of us can be proud of I dont have any illusions and thus far it doesnt look like that will happen But it should happen That is the way it should be done I warn my friends on the other side if they succeed in passing this bill without bipartisan supportif they get one or two Republicans I dont consider that bipartisan support You should at least get 75 to 80 votes on a bill this large which is onesixth of the American economy 17 percent of the American economy You should have to get 75 to 80 votes minimally It would even be better if you can get more as we did with CHIP and other bills On some we have gotten unanimous voteson bills that cost money by the way Republicans have voted for them too Republicans will vote for a good bill even if it costs some money We are not about to vote for something costing 25 trillion to 3 trillion I dont think the American people are going to stand for it Beware my friends of what you are doing I can tell you right now this isnt going to work I want to make that point as clear as I can With that I yield the floor The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Bennet The Senator from Illinois is recognized President I rise and offer my congratulations to the Real Salt Lake soccer team the newly crowned champions of Major League Soccer While Utah has a number of sports teams with proud traditions both collegiate and professionalReal Salt Lake has brought to my home State its first major professional championship since 1971 when the Utah Stars won the ABA title Fans throughout Utah are thrilled Real Salt Lake came to Utah in 2004 and faced difficulties during its first three seasons In just its fourth season however Real Salt Lake made an improbable run to the Western Conference Finals despite only sneaking into the playoffs on the last day of the regular season They eventually lost that game by a score of 10 but with their first playoff appearance and opening their new world class soccerspecific stadium their future was filled with promising signs In 2009 Real Salt Lake delivered on that promise Once again it was the last team to qualify for the playoffs and was the lowest overall seed Despite barely squeaking into the playoffs this team of overachievers sure made some noise once they got there They quickly reeled off a string of consecutive upsets against glitzier opponents with established stars dispatching topseeded and defending MLS champion Columbus and then powerhouse Chicago and its star Cuauhtemoc Blanco On November 22 the title game in Seattle pitted the littleknown upstarts of Real Salt Lake against the Western Conference champions the Los Angeles Galaxy and its megastars Landon Donovan and David Beckham After 90 minutes of regulation play and 30 minutes of overtime the game remained tied at 11 In the penalty kick shootout Real Salt Lake emerged victorious 54 as Donovans potential gametying spot kick sailed harmlessly over the crossbar Real Salt Lake had delivered the first championship of its kind in Utah in nearly four decadesand it couldnt have come in a more exciting fashion or to a more deserving group of athletes In the end it wasnt the Galaxy of stars that prevailed it was Real Salt Lake with its philosophy that mirrors the words emblazoned on the sign in its home locker room THE TEAM IS THE STAR That teamwork was certainly on display in the title tilt against Los Angeles It was reflected in Real Salt Lake Robbie Findleys breakout 64thminute strike that knotted the score at 11 and made the teams overtime and penalty kick heroics possible It was reflected in the play of Salt Lake goalkeeper and Cup final MVP Nick Rimando who turned away penalties from LAs Jovan Kirovski and Edson Buddle before besting Donovan Finally RSLs determination to overcome the odds also mirrors that of its owner Dave Checketts coach Jason Kreis and general manager Garth Lagerweyall of whom turned the team into a champion despite the naysayers who said it couldnt be done No Real Salt Lakes roster did not have the leagues biggest stars But in the words of midfielder Clint Mathis better known as Cletus RSL was the better team in every game As much as anything else that explains why champion Real Salt Lake is now the brightest light in MSLs firmament Once again I congratulate Real Salt Lake on this accomplishment Senator Bennett and I have introduced a resolution expressing the Senates congratulations for Real Salt Lake and I urge my colleagues to offer their support 
S_KS_BROWNBACK,2009-12-22,1996_2009; 1996_2009,0170; 0169, Madam President I am glad to join my colleagues in talking about the health care bill If you looked in the New York Times today there was a fullpage ad describing the bill I am putting it up here the same thing that was in the New York Times today It starts with the question I want to receive care from my doctor This on one page puts the 2600 pages in kind of what you are going to see with this bill It is convoluted It is difficult It is expensive This is what you are going to get This was in the New York Times today This is where I sit or this is what is going to happen to me in this overall system It is no wonder the American public doesnt want this They are not excited about this They are not excited about what it is going to do to the budget25 trillion That is about 700 million a day if you are counting in millions a day as one way to look at it There are some interesting things hidden within the bill One of the things I want to point out is the transfer of wealth from young people to old One of the things that has really bugged me about what we have done in so many of the government systems hereit has been a wealth transfer from younger people to older Several of my children are students and working parttime jobs and they are paying payroll taxes They say What is this payroll tax going to I say Well talk to your grandparents and tell them to say thank you to you These are funds collected that are going to pay for their retirement funds They do and the grandparents say thank you But it doesnt seem to be satisfying to them because they are saying Why arent I putting this in something I am saving money for me so that I can have something later on instead of this sort of OK I am paying and they are getting What is going to be there when I get there That sort of wealth transfer from young people to old people continues in this bill Look at this wealth transfer Younger workers will pay more for health insurance premiums so that older workers can pay less Their cost at age 25 will go up 25 percent for health insurance premiums If you are 64 it will go down 20 percent for health care This is another one of the wealth transfers that take place It isnt right It is taking from the kids It is taking from the grandkids It should not be continued It is continued in this bill You can look at it another way Subsidies in this bill go disproportionately to older Americans Average subsidies for the 55 yearolds are nearly 10 times that of a 25yearold A 25yearold gets a subsidy of 458 a 55yearold gets a subsidy of 4427another wealth transfer from younger to older Then you can look at the claims in this bill that there are going to be tax cuts for the middle class That is if you are in the lucky group For every lowtomiddleincome family with a tax cut three low tomiddleincome families have a tax increase in this bill by the structure of this bill by this structure this convoluted difficult tonavigate hardtounderstand expensive 25 trillion structure That is where we stand Likely to pass this body and then go to the House of Representatives where there is a major issue that is still brewing difficult and must be dealt with and that is the issue of public funding of abortion that is in this bill If you want to cut some of the cost out of this thing why dont you take some of those expenses out of this That would be one way to cut back some of the expenses But in the House bill they included Stupak language which continued the Hyde tradition and law of the land that the government will not pay for abortions other than cases of rape incest and life of the mother Except now buried in the Senate bill in the Reid amendment is the public funding of abortion which we havent done for years Yesterday I talked to both Congressman Stupak and Senator Nelson They both agree that the Stupak language is far superior It doesnt publicly fund abortions whereas what is in this bill now does You dont need to take my word Here is what others have said The US Conference of Catholic Bishops who want a health care bill but are opposed to the public funding of abortion and opposed to abortion say The bill is morally unacceptable unless and until it complies with longstanding current laws on abortion funding such as the Hyde amendment We voted on this floor for the NelsonHatch amendment which is now not in the bill You dont have to take that You can take Bart Stupak Democrat from Michigan who voted for the bill in the House He says It is now not acceptable A dramatic shift in Federal policy that would allow the Federal Government to subsidize insurance policies with abortion coverage The American public doesnt want that either The latest poll of December 22 shows that 72 percent of Americans oppose using any public money in the health care overhaul to pay for abortion including 54 percent of Democrats and 74 percent of Independents That is where they are That is where the public is National Right to Life which is the gold standard on standing up for life says The Reid managers amendment requires that all enrollees in an abortion covering plan make a separate payment into an account that will pay for abortions The bill also contains language that is intended to prevent or discourage any insurer from explaining what this surcharge is to be used for Moreover there is nothing in the language to suggest that payment of the abortion charge is optional for any enrollee This base bill has another thing in it It takes the individual opt out and moves to it a State optout So while lets say Kansas may opt out of the abortion funding in the bill they still have to pay their taxes that go to another State to pay for abortions there which are equally offensive to my people or other States that dont want to see this funding take place It doesnt address the issue of having preventive services include abortion There was discussion that we are not going to include preventive services in it but that is not in the language There was discussion We tried an amendment That is not there It can still be defined Now it may ultimately unwind the entire bill based upon the funding of abortion that is in the Senate bill It will be up to House Members a number of whom are very concerned and quite fired up about this particular piece to take this out I know Congressman Stupak is working to do that wants to see that done agrees with Senator Nelson that his language is far superior actually does that It is supported by the Catholic Bishops the National Right to Life and other prolife groups that say the way to go is the Stupak language It is not what is in the Senate bill The Senate bill will actually fund abortions Then we go through the specifics as I have in here of the various places that it has I met with Senator Nelson about those specifics I have addressed a number of those concerns I know he continues to work on it but at the end of the day this is one of those babies you cannot split You need to have the Stupak language in this bill I am afraid at the end of the day that is not going to be in there I know Congressman Stupak is pushing very hard for its inclusion and I wish him all the best If this legislation passes this body it is going to be up to the House of Representatives to put in that Stupak language And they can do it It is my hope they will do it I do not think the overall bill should be passed but certainly you should not have this piece of funding in this bill in breaking the longstanding work we have had in the Hyde agreement in the Hyde language Thank you very much Madam President How much time do we have remaining on our side Madam President in that concluding minute what I would like to briefly speak about is the overall process I think there are people in this body who did not want to include things such as abortion funding in the bill But when you operate in a closed process like this these sorts of things end up happening because the people who work on these issues are excluded I certainly was not consulted I am not saying anyone said Well look we are not going to get your vote anyway so we do not need to have it But if you do not want to have abortion funding in it one should look past that and say Lets get the people who understand and work on this issue and we agree we should not have it in there that is what President Obama said it should not be in thereand lets see what language passes by their muster That was not done Unfortunately that is part of what has happened in this process I think it is tragic that it has happened that way in this process I think it is wrong I think it builds a bill that then people are not satisfied with and certainly a process they do not agree with that takes place in this overall bill It is still not too late There is still time to address these issues now that we have the bill to be able to look at If people of good faith on the other side want to get these addressed there are ways and we have the language on how to address it It is called the Stupak language It has already passed the House of Representatives It is called the NelsonHatch amendment that was debated here although it was not passed We can do that It is important that it get done This bill is not supported by the American public and particularly this funding piece that is so offensive to so many Americans We can debate about abortion but the government should not be funding it and that is agreed to by over 70 percent of the American public I just ask my colleagues on the other side as you move on forward with thisif this bill passes heretake this piece out We know what language is agreed to and works This piece can be taken out It can be taken out yet And I think the whole bill may unwind if it is not taken outunwind because of a number of Democrats who voted for the bill on the House side who want the Stupak language and they do not want the inferior language that was put in on the Senate side that will actually allow and start the funding of abortion that we have not done for 30 years Madam President I thank my colleagues and yield the floor 
S_GA_CHAMBLISS,2009-12-07,2003_2009; 2003_2009; 2003_2009; 2003_2009,0096; 0097; 0095; 0098, Is there anything in the Bennet amendment that removes the expenditure of almost 500 billion from Medicare in the base Reid bill that would require the restoration of those cuts to benefit Medicare versus using it as a fund to pay for the underlying Reid bill If I understand what the Senator is saying in his amendment he is requiring the Office of Management and Budget as well as CMS to certify to Congress basically that the savings that are referred to in the Bennet amendment as well as in the Senators amendment are in fact being used to fund Medicare benefits versus being used to fund other benefits outside Medicare until such time as Medicare is fully funded Would the Senator yield for an additional question The language in the Bennet amendment that passed 100 to nothing the other day said basically that Medicare savings should benefit the Medicare Program and Medicare beneficiaries That sounds pretty straightforward pretty simple But let me ask the Senator Let me address a question to our friend from Wyoming who is a medical doctor in addition to being an outstanding Senator What we are being asked to believe from the folks on the other side and what the American people are struggling with and having a hard time believing is they are saying that even though they are cutting Medicare by a total of 450 billionplus over a 10year period actually the solvency of Medicare is going to be extended They expect the American people to believe that somehow The fact is we know from the information we received this spring from the bipartisan Medicare Commission unless something is done Medicare is going to become insolvent in the year 2017 pure and simple What we are doing is not taking the savings they are proposingand we dont agree with them but irrespective of that irrespective of the savings they are saying are going to be achieved instead of applying that back we are going to use that to grow the size of government tie some reimbursement payments to physicians to the Medicare Program and now we are looking at about a 23percent reduction in payments to physicians as reimbursement under Medicare if we dont take some action next year When you put all this together the American people are saying You have to be kidding me How in the world are you going to extend the life of Medicare by cutting it by almost 500 billion 
H_CO_POLIS,2009-12-03,2009_2009; 2009_2009; 2009_2009,0304; 0305; 0306, Speaker by direction of the Committee on Rules I call up House Resolution 941 and ask for its immediate consideration The Clerk read the resolution as follows H Res 941 Resolved That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill HR 4154 to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the new carryover basis rules in order to prevent tax increases and the imposition of compliance burdens on many more estates than would benefit from repeal to retain the estate tax with a 3500000 exemption and for other purposes All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI The bill shall be considered as read All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill to final passage without intervening motion except 1 one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means and 2 one motion to recommit Sec 2 In the engrossment of HR 4154 the Clerk shall a add the text of HR 2920 as passed by the House as new matter at the end of HR 4154 b conform the title of HR 4154 to reflect the addition to the engrossment of the text of HR 2920 c assign appropriate designations to provisions within the engrossment and d conform provisions for short titles within the engrossment Speaker for the purposes of debate only I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida Mr Lincoln Diaz Balart All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only General Leave I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous materials into the Record Mr Speaker this rule provides for consideration of HR 4154 the Permanent Estate Tax Relief for Families Farmers and Small Businesses Act of 2009 The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI and against the bill itself The rule provides that the previous question shall be considered as ordered without intervening motions except 1 hour of debate and one motion to recommit with or without instructions In the engrossment of HR 4154 the Clerk is directed to add at the end the text of HR 2920 the Statutory PayAsYouGoAct of 2009 as passed by the House Mr Speaker this past weekend in honor of the Thanksgiving holidays NBCs Meet the Press hosted the Reverend Rick Warren in a discussion on giving and civic duty During the dialogue Rev Warren stated his belief that it isnt a sin to be rich but it is a sin to die rich While I dont agree with Rev Warren on many issues I ask my colleagues to now reflect on the meaning of those words The Reverend was speaking of course of the importance of charity and our moral obligation to improve the condition of our fellow man whenever and wherever we can Today I speak to you with the same sense of dutyduty to our country that has allowed me personally to achieve personal wealth and in turn to help others Mr Speaker the bill before us under this rule is a significant tax cut Without this bill the estate tax will return in the year 2011 at a much lower exemption amount an exemption of 1 million instead of an exemption at a rate of 35 million and at a much higher tax rate a tax rate of 55 percent rather than a tax rate of 45 percent which we have under this bill We all know that the occasion of the death of a loved one is a very difficult time for family and friends The price of love is unfortunately loss and thats a price that we all must pay at some point in our lives While no act of government can ease this emotional pain today we have the opportunity to at least give families who have achieved great success some surety in their ability to ensure that the next generation will receive the benefit of their works An estate tax distorts a free market less than an income tax Instead of taxing productive capital it takes taxes from a random heir On a revenueneutral basis I for one would much rather pay taxes after dying than before dying And however much an income tax may distort the market an estate tax distorts it less on a revenueneutral basis Mr Speaker allow me to be clear Individuals like myself who through hard work have been able to start businesses create jobs and as a result have been rewarded with the financial resources to provide a high standard of living for our families have a duty to our fellow Americans to pay our fair share And an estate tax the existence of an estate tax is critical to prevent a permanent aristocracy from arising in this country When I think of the everyday tax burden for my constituents or for that matter for my staff and associates as a proportion of their income as a result of sales taxes property taxes let alone income taxes I can think of no credible argument for suggesting that an estate tax is unreasonable I also take comfort in knowing that with the passage of this bill we are locking in that 99 percent of my constituents will never pay the estate tax According to The Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center under this proposal only 25 percent thats 14 of 1 percent of debts would be subject to an estate tax We ask those who labor to build the roads to also shoulder the cost We ask those who educate our Nations children to also help pay for the schools Shouldnt we ask those who die with wealth to help give back a little to those around them I say to my colleagues this is fair this is right When factoring the full costs of being a member of a society its very clear that all too often we ask the most of those who have the least For our country to continue to prosper we cant just rely on the middle class to support our Nations public safety and welfare and to cushion the success of families who are successful in this country I can personally tell you as one of those Americans thats in the 25 percent I would gladly pay an estate tax to give back to the 9975 percent of families who do the heavy lifting in this country every day and ensure that they never have to pay this tax and that family farms can be passed down to the next generation and small operating family businesses will be subject to no estate tax Yes Mr Speaker I agree with Rev Warren that its no sin to be rich but I disagree that it is a sin to die rich A lifes work should rightly be a benefit to ones heirs and ones causes My belief that a family farm a family business or simply accumulated wealth should be passed from one generation to the next is consistent with the fact that those who benefited the most from the freedom and security that this country offers should pay their fair share for the benefits and the landscape that allowed them to reach the level of success that they did What all Americans deserve rich or poor is the knowledge that at a time of great personal pain for families the stress will not be exacerbated by a complex or uncertain tax policy Thats one of the many reasons I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this rule and the underlying bill Throughout our history transfer taxes have been used to fund critical operations of the Federal Government The modern estate tax was established by the Revenue Act of 1916 to offset declining import tariff revenues as a result of and to finance the United States participation in World War I Since World War I the estate tax has continued to provide Federal revenues that have financed World War II and the New Deal and have helped end the Great Depression The estate tax includes importantly an unlimited deduction for charitable giving In 2006 nearly twothirds of charitable requests came from estates valued over 10 million What a way for Americans to leave a legacy for the next generation Universities hospitals and arts organizations have come to rely on these contributions from our Nations most wealthy One need only tour a college campus to see the direct impact of the philanthropy on our students and its effect on our future displayed prominently on plaques outside many campus buildings like those at the University of Colorado in Boulder which I represent HR 4154 the Permanent Estate Tax Relief for Families Farmers and Small Businesses Act does exactly what it says The bill will make permanent the lowest estate tax rate our Nation has seen in a decade making the current rate permanent and giving families the ability to plan ahead for an orderly transfer of assets Business owners will be able to plan ahead to ensure that their employees will still have a job and their company will be able to continue to provide for their families after theyre gone Farmers will be able to keep their land in their family I remind my colleagues that the 35 million exemption means that no family will pay any estate tax unless the estate is valued at at least 35 million It is substantially higher than it has been in this decade and without our action today we put families in a situation of unnecessary financial uncertainty at a time when their head and their hearts can least afford it Without this bill the estate tax will return in the year 2011 at a much lower exemption amount of 1 million and a much higher tax rate of 55 percent Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time Mr LINCOLN DIAZBALART of Florida I would like to thank my friend the gentleman from Colorado Mr Polis for the time Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Eight years ago Mr Speaker the Republicanled Congress passed legislation that provided over 13 trillion in tax relief by among others gradually increasing the exemption for the estate tax while decreasing the tax rate itself As part of that legislation the estate tax also known as the death tax is set to disappear next year The underlying bill would undo the repeal of the death tax and instead bring back the tax extend the estate tax rate of 45 percent and include an unindexed exemption I believe these are excessively high rates of taxation especially when we realize that the tax is imposed at the end of a lifetime of work on which taxes were paid throughout the stages in which income was made It is wrong I believe to tax individuals who have spent their entire lives working to provide their families with some financial security and so thats why I oppose the underlying legislation This double taxation which is really what were talking about today I believe is destructive to familyowned businesses and farms which are often torn apart or need to be liquidated entirely just to pay those burdensome taxes at the time of death Americans who work hard and pay taxes all of their lives I dont think should be punished for responsibly saving with yet another tax when they pass away When the country has doubledigit unemployment the current majority in Congress is threatening small businesses the engines of economic growth and job creation in the Nation with even higher tax burdens Small businesses are often struggling to survive to meet payroll and avoid layoffs and yet this is another example Mr Speaker of the fact that the majority time and time again is proposing legislation that hampers the ability of small businesses to thrive and to hire new workers Its unfortunate that the majority feels that they can continuously impact hit small businesses with tax after tax and expect them to survive and thrive and retain their workers Thats not the way the economy works Even if small business owners do not receive an estate tax bill they still spend resources on estate tax compliance According to a recent survey of small and mediumsized manufacturers those small businesses spend an average of 94000 on fees and estate planning costs in preparation for an estate tax bill Imagine what a small business Mr Speaker could do with that money They could invest it in their company to grow their business They could add more workers Instead the majority prefers placing more and more burdens And this is but one example the legislation being brought forth to the floor today of the majoritys incessant endeavor to place more and more burdens on the engines of our economic growth Small businesses are responsible for 60 to 80 percent of all new net jobs that were created in the last decade If the majority continues with their current policies if they continue on this track of placing more and more burdens on small business the unemployment rate is going to continue to rise I think what we should be doing is everything possible to lower unemployment to spur investment and job growth Thats where we should be heading So I believe what we should be doing is extending the repeal of the death tax And many of us in this Congress especially on this side of the aisle we feel very strongly on this issue Short of passing the permanent repeal which I support at the very least I think we should enact legislation that sets a reasonable rate provides an appropriate exemption amount and indexes that amount for inflation We already saw with the alternative minimum tax what not indexing is capable of doing when Congress acts in that manner So unfortunately the bill does nothing of what I just said a reasonable rate and indexing an exemption amount Yet we on our side of the aisle will not be able to have a debate on legislation on a proposal to do just that to index an exemption amount and set a reasonable rate indefinitely into the future We wont be able to do that because the majority again is closing down the process shutting down debate They promised to do quite the opposite as you know Mr Speaker So lets contrast what the current majority is doing today with the estate tax rule that we passed when we were in the majority That rule allowed our distinguished colleague Mr Pomeroy to offer his substitute amendment Today we in the minority will be treated much differently We will not be given the opportunity that we gave the current majority and Mr Pomeroy We will not be allowed to debate our substitute proposal We will not be afforded a vote on our alternative legislation The difference in treatment is not an isolated incident but the standard operating procedure for this majority They continuously close down the process They shut out Members from both sides of the aisle from being able to introduce and have debated their amendments and I think it is unfortunate I reserve the balance of my time Speaker let me be clear with what happens if the House does not pass this bill The estate tax would go away for 1 year in the year 2010 and then it would return at 55 percent and a deduction of only 1 million so every estate above 1 million would be taxed at a rate of 55 percent Many families would lose their family businesses their family farms if we fail to act and pass this bill to preserve the ability of Americans to pass along their assets to the next generation It would also create a very bizarre circumstance in the year 2010 where there would be an incentive to die I had a friend with a good sense of humor who stated that his wealthy family his father had joked with him that he planned not to stand near the top of a staircase in the year 2010 if that was the case Mr Speaker the estate tax is paid by very few Americans Historically fewer than 2 percent of Americans have paid the estate tax and under this bill it will be even less And only 35 percent of those who pay the estate tax pay it on small business assets and only 5 percent on farms When looking at specifically familyowned businesses the number goes down to onehalf of 1 percent Mr Speaker let us talk about the options for wealthy families The estate tax does two important things First it provides revenue to government to provide services in the context in which wealth can grow provides the landscaping in our country that allows entrepreneurs and businesses to succeed Programs paid for from this revenue fund our social safety net our legal structure our public safety programs and our regulatory framework that allows businesses to prosper It is the protection of the law that allows those who have gained wealth to be able to keep it and transfer it to the next generation The second and arguably also more important function of the estate tax is to provide an incentive for charitable giving By supporting charities and nonprofit organizations of their choice the wealthy can simultaneously give back to the community directly and protect the assets that they leave to their heirs The estate tax is an important incentive to leverage the work of government with the efforts of nonprofits to create broad opportunities and assistance throughout society By making the rules of the estate tax stable and permanent we give families the ability to plan for their future as well as invest in the future of their communities We know that planned giving is an important part of the fundraising strategy for the nonprofits that do the good work that government and industry cannot and there is no denying the link between the estate tax rate and the amount of planned giving A 2004 Congressional Budget Office analysis of charitable giving in the year 2000 indicated that estate tax not only provided an incentive for charitable giving at death but also played a role in philanthropic decisions made during peoples lives The same report estimated that the repeal of the estate tax would result in a decrease in bequests of anywhere from 16 to 28 percent or 13 billion to 25 billion more than total corporate donations in a year I ask my colleagues which universities do you know could take a 16 to 28 percent hit to their endowment coupled with the decreases in the market of the last year and yet continue to prepare our students to be competitive in the global marketplace This is the realworld impact of what would actually occur were the estate tax to be abolished in the year 2010 not to mention what would happen when it came back at 55 percent and only a 1 million deduction the following year Now imagine in the worst case scenario devised by opponents of the estate tax Imagine that came true for a family that in order to pay the tax the heirs had to liquidate the assets of a business that had been in the family for some time Do opponents of this bill truly believe that somehow making the family pay capital gains tax on these assets if they had purchased them in 1959 would be better I know in my district due to the growth and economic success Colorado has enjoyed taxation on real estate assets as an example from a 1959 basis would be devastating It would capture a much larger portion of middle class families Many middle class families and indeed wealthy families worth 1 million 2 million 3 million would be stuck with large tax bills forcing liquidation if they were forced to pay capital gains tax on a 1950 basis or a 1959 basis I cant tell my constituents that I am against a permanent reduction in the estate tax and yet support a dramatic increase in capital gains taxation for them which would bring the estate tax to upper middle class families I hope the majority of my colleagues agree and will support the rule and the underlying bill I would like to thank Chairman Rangel the members of the Ways and Means Committee and their staffs for their efforts in bringing this bill and the gentleman from North Dakota Mr Pomeroy for introducing this bill I urge my colleagues to consider that 9975 percent of Americans will never pay this tax and those who do should be thankful that they have had the opportunity to succeed in this great country and the privilege the honor of being in a position where they are subject to this tax because their estates are worth more than 35 million I would like to remind my colleagues who stand by the old adage you cant take it with you and I ask my friends and colleagues to consider the farreaching benefits of charity and a sense of duty to country and I ask for the passage of this rule and the underlying legislation I reserve the balance of my time Mr LINCOLN DIAZBALART of Florida Mr Speaker I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia Mr Gingrey I am our final speaker so I reserve the balance of my time to close Mr LINCOLN DIAZBALART of Florida Mr Speaker I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina Ms Foxx my distinguished friend and colleague from the Rules Committee Speaker I want to begin by addressing some of the misconceptions and inaccuracies in the arguments that have been made on the other side of the aisle First Id like to address some made by the gentleman from Texas that this is a tax on those who have paid the highest tax rates throughout their lives Id like to dispute this notion Many of the people who have accumulated great wealth in this country have throughout their lives paid the capital gains tax rather than the income tax rate I for one and Im I think the fourth or fifthwealthiest Member of this bodyIve accumulated some degree of wealth with my success in the Internet sector starting companies selling them Ive paid the capital gains tax That is a 15 percent tax not a 396 or a 35 percent tax In a moment we will hear some quotes from Mr Buffett Mr Gates and Mr Soros three wealthy Americans all supporters of the estate tax They have also accumulated their wealth and have paid the capital gains rate In the case of for instance Bill Gates the wealthiest American he has paid a rate substantially below 15 percent due to his charitable contributions The rate that Mr Gates has paid is probably somewhere in the 1012 percent tax range So again I have paid less percentage tax than members of my staff here in Congress that earn 50000 60000 a year They pay a higher tax rate So its inaccurate to say that those who are hit with the estate tax have paid the highest tax rate throughout their lives There might be some movie stars sports stars highwage earners that have been paying the highincome margins highest marginal income tax rate throughout their lives But the majority of wealth is accumulated on the capital side and has been subject to the capital gains rate which had been 20 percent more recently 15 percent and scheduled to return to 20 percent regardless well below the highest marginal rate Id also like to address a remark made by my colleague from North Carolina Dr Foxx She called this the biggest increase ever in the inheritance tax rate Again this is a decrease a decrease in the inheritance tax Yes there is a 1year effect For the year 2010 alone its an increase For every other year its a decrease Instead of 55 percent and 1 million every dollar above 1 million would be taxed at 55 percent if we dont pass this in the year 2011 and beyond We are reducing that This is a substantial decrease one of the largest decreases in the inheritance tax rate to 45 percent from 55 percent in 2011 and beyond And were increasing the deduction Were starting that at a 35 million estatethats a 7 million estate for a couple that passes away instead of a 1 million deduction to be clear Id further like to make it clear that repealing the estate tax and replacing it with a capital gains tax on the increase in basis would be a tax increase as proposed by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle This would be a tax increase for upper middle class families and would actually result in many families losing their family businesses If you have a 3 million family business family farm under the Democratic proposal they pay zero tax Under the Republican proposal a 3 million family estate or farm with a very low basis they started it maybe with 100000 in the 1950s so thats a 3 million gain that would be subject to 450000 capital gains tax At 20 percent it would be over 600000 in taxes That could result in the family losing the farm or losing the small business Under the Democratic proposal we allow families to keep family farms and small businesses in the family Mr Speaker this bill is one of many steps that Congress must take towards an equitable Tax Code The bill highlights Democratic commitments to fairness by making permanent the current estate tax exemption of 35 million 7 million total at a maximum tax rate of 45 percent Opponents of this bill may say the estate tax should be repealed Well thats supporting a debt finance tax cut of 13 trillion Yes repealing the estate tax in its entirety would result in an increase in the deficit of 13 trillion Thats 1 trillion in lost revenue and 277 billion in increased interest payments on our growing national debt Does that sound like fiscal responsibility The only result of repealing the estate tax would be that the 25 percent quarter of 1 percent of the wealthiest American families will pay a small estate tax while other Americans wont have to suffer from increased debt Mr Speaker lets be honest with the American people The estates of those 9975 percent of Americans will continue to be tax free As for those 25 percent that are subject to the tax such as Bill Gates estate such as my own we understand that the government that protects our business activities the traditions that enable us to rely on certain things happening thats what creates capital and enables net worth to increase Those are Bill Gates words not mine But I strongly agree In Warren Buffetts opposition to the repeal of the estate tax he said that the repeal of the estate tax would be akin to choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold medal winners in the 2000 Olympics because without the estate tax you in effect will have an aristocracy of wealth which means you pass down the ability to command the resources of the nation based on heredity rather than merit America is and should be a meritocracy Estate tax helps prevent a permanent aristocracy of the wealthy from arising in this country Some opponents of the estate tax claim that it forces families to hand over half of their wealth to the government But the facts simply dont support this claim The truth is that few estates pay any estate tax whatsoever and those that do pay less than 20 percent of the value of their estate We also know that the claims of rampant liquidation of farms is completely untrue In fact the American Farm Bureau Federation acknowledged to The New York Times that it couldnt find a single example of a farm to substantiate the claim even when the estate tax was higher 55 percent rather than the 45 percent it is today Id like to give a quote from the president of the National Farmers Union who says Family farmers and ranchers are insulted by those who use farmers as the reason for eliminating estate taxes Id also like to give a quote from George Soros George Soros said The estate tax is the least damaging of all our taxation because it does not interfere with wealth creation It increases social equality It is so obvious estate taxation is a valuable taxation and we should keep it Again on a revenue neutral basis I would much rather pay 1000 in tax after I die than before when Im using that capital to create value and jobs or at least I was before I got to Congress Mr Speaker our choice here is clear We can pass this bill which will remove the impact of the estate tax from 9975 percent of Americans and give those who will pay this tax a substantially larger deductible We can make sure that family businesses and family farms wont be subject to onerous taxation Or we can increase the deficit by over 1 trillion and increase taxes for estates of 2 million 3 million 4 million with sizable capital gains within those estates Once again I thank Chairman Rangel the members of the Committee on Ways and Means and their staffs as well as Representative Pomeroy for bringing this important legislation to the floor In America its not a sin to be rich nor is it a crime to die rich This bill gives our Nations wealthiest families the ability to know exactly what their obligation to the Nation that fostered their wealth will be And it is fair and it is just Mr Speaker Id ask my colleagues to join me on the side of facts equity and the 99 percent of Americans who will never pay this tax and who wish that they were lucky enough to be successful enough to pay this tax and remind them that a no vote is a vote against these principles I ask my colleagues to vote yes on the Permanent Estate Tax Relief for Families Farmers and Small Businesses Act of 2009 I urge a yes vote on the previous question and I urge a yes vote on the rule The material previously referred to by Mr Lincoln DiazBalart of Florida is as follows Amendment to H Res 941 Offered by Mr Lincoln DiazBalart of Florida At the end of the resolution insert the following new section Sec 3 On the third legislative day after the adoption of this resolution immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV and without intervention of any point of order the House shall proceed to the consideration of the resolution H Res 554 amending the Rules of the House of Representatives to require that legislation and conference reports be available on the Internet for 72 hours before consideration by the House and for other purposes The resolution shall be considered as read The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and any amendment thereto to final adoption without intervening motion or demand for division of the question except 1 one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Rules 2 an amendment if offered by the Minority Leader or his designee and if printed in that portion of the Congressional Record designated for that purpose in clause 8 of rule XVIII at least one legislative day prior to its consideration which shall be in order without intervention of any point of order or demand for division of the question shall be considered as read and shall be separately debatable for twenty minutes equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent and 3 one motion to recommit which shall not contain instructions Clause 1c of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of House Resolution 554 The information contained herein was provided by Democratic Minority on multiple occasions throughout the 109th Congress The Vote on the Previous Question What It Really Means This vote the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule is not merely a procedural vote A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow the opposition at least for the moment to offer an alternative plan It is a vote about what the House should be debating Mr Clarence Cannons Precedents of the House of Representatives VI 308311 describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House Cannon cites the Speakers ruling of January 13 1920 to the effect that the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition in order to offer an amendment On March 15 1909 a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry asking who was entitled to recognition Speaker Joseph G Cannon RIllinois said The previous question having been refused the gentleman from New York Mr Fitzgerald who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment is entitled to the first recognition Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic majority they will say the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution and has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever But that is not what they have always said Listen to the definition of the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress page 56 Heres how the Rules Committee described the rule using information from Congressional Quarterlys American Congressional Dictionary If the previous question is defeated control of debate shifts to the leading opposition member usually the minority Floor Manager who then manages an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the pending business Deschlers Procedure in the US House of Representatives the subchapter titled Amending Special Rules states a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules opens the resolution to amendment and further debate Chapter 21 section 212 Section 213 continues Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon Clearly the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Democratic majoritys agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan Speaker I yield back the balance of my time and I move the previous question on the resolution 
S_OH_BROWN,2009-12-02,2007_2009; 2007_2009,0198; 0197, President I certainly appreciate Senator Vitters empathy for victims of breast cancer for people who obviously should be tested for breast cancer in many cases more frequently than they are I am sorry about Wendys mothers death from breast cancer I think though that Senator Vitter missed the larger point While most of us in this Chamber disagree with the finding of that Bush appointed commissioncommittee commission task forceI think the bigger question is that a whole lot of the status quo which Senator Vitter has defended sort of ad hominem the bigger question is under the status quo so many women arent getting tested for breast cancer It is estimated that 4000 breast cancer deaths could be prevented just by increasing the percentage of women who receive breast cancer screening That is why the Mikulski amendment is so important It is important because in this country today if you take a group of 1000 women who have breast cancer and who have insurance and 1000 women who have breast cancer who dont have insurance those who dont have insurance are 40 percent more likely to die So the issue is that committeeI think that commission made a mistake We pretty much most of us here think that commission made a mistake I am not sure why those people whom President Bush put on the commission made the decision they did It should have been oncologists sitting Senator Vitter is right about that The larger point is that women without insurance dont get tested and women without insurance are 40 percent more likely to die of breast cancer than those with insurance At the same time as the Presiding Officer knows in the State of Maryland women typically pay more for their insurance than men do on the average So if we are going to do this right it means we need insurance reform which is what this legislation does No more preexisting conditions no more men and women who have their insurance canceled because they got too sick last year and had too many expenses and the insurance companies practiced rescission and they cut them off No more if I have insurance and if I have a child born with a preexisting condition do I lose my insurance I come to the floor pretty much every day reading letters from people in Ohiofrom Galion and Girard and Gallipolis and Lima all over my State Typically people were pretty happy with their insurance if they had written me a year ago these people But today these people writing found out their insurance doesnt cover what they thought it did They end up losing their insurance because of a preexisting condition They cant get insurance because they once had breast cancer They have had this discrimination against them because of gender or geography or disability That is what is important about the bill and what is important about the Mikulski amendment That is why I would hope Senator Vitter as he is pushing for assistance for women with breast cancerI applaud him for thatwould go deeper than just dismissing the recommendations of one government commission and that in fact he would advocate for better testing more frequent testing for women who are not getting tested often enough today and that the rates for women would be comparable to the rates for men That is again why the Mikulski amendment is so important I will repeat The health reform legislation as is will finally put an end to discrimination discrimination that charges women significantly higher premiums because they have had children It is considered a preexisting condition by some insurance companies if a woman had a Csection because she might get pregnant again and she is going to have another Csection and that costs more A woman with a Csection has a preexisting condition A woman who has beenin some cases with some insurance companies policiesvictimized by domestic violence has a preexisting condition because the boyfriend the husband or whoever hit her the one time the insurance companies would suggest is going to do it again So she has a preexisting condition What kind of health care system is that That is why I suggest Senator Vitter support the Mikulski amendment and support this legislation In fact it will put rules on insurance policies so people will be treated in a different way than they have been in the past Let me talk for a moment specifically about the Mikulski amendment and why it is so important It will ensure that women are able to access needed preventive care and screenings at no additional cost One of the things in spite of the MCCain amendmentand I appreciated Senator Baucuss comments a minute ago about how ironic it is I was in the House of Representatives for 14 years and in the Senate now for the last 3 or so I have heard so many colleagues eviscerate Medicare They have tried to cut Medicare privatize it and come at it from all different directions repeatedly over these last 15 years Now they want to tell us they are the ones who want to protect Medicare In fact this legislation saves money and saves lives and this legislation saves Medicare One of the things this legislation does for Medicare beneficiaries is it will begin to provide these preventive care screenings so seniors will pay no copay It is not cutting Medicare and services as my friends on the other side sayall those who are opposed to every part of the bill most of whom have tried to slow this legislation down We cannot even vote on the MCCain amendment We are ready to do it but the Republicans dont seem to want to move forward on this legislation Let me go back to why the Mikulski amendment makes so much sense All health care plans would cover comprehensive womens preventive care and screenings requiring that recommended services be covered at no cost to women We know that to get preventive screenings and careif we make them at no cost the chances of people getting them are significantly higher More than half of women delay or avoid preventive care because of the costs One in five women at age 50 has not received a mammogram in the past 2 years That isnt because the Commission appointed by the former President Bush made this decision it is not because of their bureaucratic decision that Senator Vitter rails about and many of us agree with it is not because 1 in 5 women age 50 has not received a mammogram it is that they dont have insurance in most cases and they cannot afford the mammogram In 2009 some 40000 women will lose their lives to breast cancer 4000 breast cancer deaths onetenth of those could have been prevented by increasing these preventive screenings These kinds of mammograms this preventive care and these doctor visits will be covered for free for women This amendment would broaden the comprehensive set of womens health services that health insurance companies must cover and pay for For instance it would ensure that women of all ages are able to receive annual mammograms covered by their insurer It would encourage coverage of pregnancy and postpartum depression screenings Pap smears screenings for domestic violence and annual womens health screenings It makes so much sense It would save the lives of women and it means women would suffer from a lot less illnesses It will save money for the health care system because these illnesses will be detected much earlier and women will get the kind of care they should That is what this whole legislation is about and what the Mikulski amendment will add to This amendment will remove any and all financial barriers to preventive care so we can diagnose diseases and illnesses earlywhen we have the best chance at being able to save lives obviously Understand again this legislation and the Mikulski amendment are supported by the National Organization for Women the National Partnership of Women and Families the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and all kinds of womens organizations They understand this is the best thing for women in this country I hope the Senate can proceed to a vote on this amendment I hope my Republican colleagues will not just talk about the bad decision of this Commissionand most of us think it was a bad decisionbut actually do something about it something substantive and give women in this country a fairer shake from health care insurance companies and cover these preventive services and cancer screenings It will make a big difference if we can move forward and expand preventive health care services to women I yield the floor The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Merkley The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized I say to Senator Dodd we remember 10 years ago when the insurance companies came to the government and said we can do something that later became Medicare Advantage and we can do it less expensively They said we can do it for 5 percent less than the cost of Medicare and the government unfortunately made the agreement with them to sign up to do that Then what happened in the last 10 years is the insurance lobbyists came here and lobbied the Bush administration and lobbied the Congress and got bigger payments It is a subsidy for the insurance companies but you and Senator Baucus and Senator Durbin said it is not Medicare it is private insurance privatized form of Medicare that serves the insurance companies very well is that correct but doesnt serve the seniors in this country

describe one of my real patients but I will not use her real name I will call her Sheila Sheila was 32 years old She came in with a breast mass I examined it and thought it was a cyst I sent her to get an ultrasound which confirmed a cyst OK We did a mammogram to make sure The mammogram said it looks like a cyst The standard of care for somebody with a cyst is to watch it expectantly unless it is painful because 99 percent of them are benign cysts I had the good fortune to do a needle drainage on her cyst 3 days after she had her mammogram There were highly malignant cells within the cyst She has since died The reason I wanted to tell the story about Sheila is because what the Senator from Ohio in supporting the Mikulski amendment doesnt recognize is we dont allow the Preventive Services Task Force to set the rules and guidelines We do something worse We let the Secretary of HHS set the guidelines The people who ought to be setting the guidelines are not the government they are the professional societies that know the literature know the standards of care know the best practices and in fact the Mikulski amendment doesnt mandate mammograms for women It leaves it to HRSA the Health Resources Services Administration which has no guidelines on it today whatsoever So what you are saying with the Mikulski amendment is we want the government to once again decideall of us are rejecting what the Preventive Services Task Force has said but instead we are going to shift and pivot and say we will let the HRSA decide what your care should be The other aspect of the Mikulski amendment I fully agree with I dont think there ought to be a copay on any preventive services I agree 100 percent But the last place we ought to be making decisions about care and process and procedure is in a government agency that No 1 is going to look at cost as much as at preventive effectiveness If the truth be known the Preventive Services Task Force from a cost standpointas a practicing physician I know how to read what they put outfrom a cost standpoint it is exactly right From a clinical standpoint they are exactly wrong because if you happen to be under 50 and didnt have a screening mammogram and your cancer was missed to you they are 100 percent wrong You see the government cannot practice medicine effectively What we are trying to do in this bill throughout is have the government practice medicine whether it is the comparative effectiveness panel or the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission What we have asked is for the government to make decisions Let me tell you what that is That is the government standing between me and my patient It is denying me the ability to use my knowledge my training my 25 years of wellearned gray hair and combine that with family history social history psychological history where it might be important and clinical science and me putting my hand on a patient such as I did Sheila Most physicians would never have stuck a needle in that cyst and she would not have lived the 12 years that she lived She would have lived 1 or 2 years But she got 12 years of life because clinical judgment wasnt deferred or denied by a government agency There is a wonderful member of the British Parliament who happens to be a physician When we were debating the issue of the comparative effectiveness panel which will be applied to whatever HRSA or the Secretary does I asked him What about the national institute of comparative effectiveness in England Here is what he said As a physician it ruins my relationship with my patient because no longer is my patient 100 percent my concern Now my patient is 80 percent my concern and the government is 20 percent of my concern So what I do is I take my eye off my patient 20 percent of the time to make sure I am complying with what the national institute of comparative effectiveness sayseven if it is not in my patients best interest When we pass a bill that is going to subterfuge or undermine the advocacy of physicians for their patients the wonderful health care we have in this country will decline There are a lot of other things about the bill I dont agree with But the No 1 thing as a practicing physician that I disagree with is the very factthe thing I am most opposed to as a practicing physicianI like best practices I use Vanderbilt in my practice I like them They make me more efficient and make me a better doctor But they are not mandated for me when I see something that in my judgment and in the art of medicine I get to go the other way because I know what is best for my patient What we have in this bill is what we passed with the stimulus bill the comparative effectiveness panelwhich is utilized in this bill and we have the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission saying you have to cut Where do we cut Whose breast cancer screening do we cut next year When we have the Commission saying we have to unless we act affirmatively in another way we are dividing the loyalty of every physician in this country away from their patients They are no longer a 100percent advocate for their patients This is a government centered bill It is not a patientcentered bill Going back to the Mikulski amendment and what will come with the Murkowski amendment the Murkowski amendment is far better It does everything Mikulski does but doesnt divide the loyalty or advocacy of the physician Here is what it does The Murkowski amendment says nobody steps between you and your doctornobody not an insurance company not Medicare or Medicaid We use as a reference the professional societies in this country who do know best whether it be for mammograms and the American College of Surgeons the American College of OBGYNs the American College of Oncology the American Academy of Internal Medicine or the American College of Physicians which have come to a consensus in terms of what best practices are but dont mandate what will or will not be paid for when in fact the art of medicine is applied to save somebodys life such as Sheilas For you see if this bill passed Sheila would have lived 2 years instead of 12 Ten years was really important to her family She got to see the children I delivered for her grow up One of them she got to see married If we decide the government is going to practice medicine which is what this bill doesthe government steps between the patient and their caregiver deciding in Washington what we will dowhat you will have is good outcomes 80 percent of the time and disasters 20 percent of the time That is not what we want I do not deny that there are plenty of problems in my profession in terms of not being as good as we should be of not having our eye on the ball some of the time of making mistakes some of the time I do not deny that But what I do embrace is most people who go into the field of medicine go in for exactly the right reason that is to help people It is so ironic to me that we have a bill before us that limits and discourages and takes away the most altruistic of all efforts which is to do 100 percent the best right thing for your patient The reason having HRSA or the Secretary set guidelines is bad is because most patients do not fit the textbook Here is what the textbook says but this patient has this condition this history and this finding that are different What we have done in this bill is multiple times take the learned judgment of caregivers and say You will bow to what the Federal Government says you will bow to what HRSA says you will bow to what the Secretary of HHS says Seventyfive times in this bill there are new programs created 6950 times in this bill are requirements for the Secretary to set up new rules and regulations If you do not think that will put the government between you and your care you have no understanding of health care in this country and you have no understanding of the problems we face today because of Medicare and Medicaid rules that interrupt and limit the ability for us to care in the best way for our patients I am for the prevention aspects of the Mikulski amendment I think it is a great idea As a matter of fact it should not be just about women It should be about screening for prostate cancer for men as well It should be about treadmills for people with high cholesterol It should be about true preventive measures Why were they not included Because what we have done under the Mikulski amendment is 892 million over 10 years We want to do this for one group but we will not do it for the other If you think the government will not get in between let me give three examples right now which violate Federal law today The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services today violates Federal law They ration the following three things If in fact you are elderly and you have a complication with your colon and you are a highrisk patient to have a perforation if you were to have a colonoscopythat is when we go in with a fiber optic light to look at the colonMedicare denies the ability for you to have a CT automated cameracentered swallowedpill colonoscopy which is available The technology is proven and is being used outside of Medicare You cannot have a video colonoscopy by way of a remote control camera Why did CMS eliminate that They eliminated it because it costs too much So if you are 87 years old and you have a mass in your colon and you cannot have a regular colonoscopy you cannot even buy this procedure it is against the law because Medicare forbids it No 2and this has happened to me numerous timeswomen with severe osteoporosisa loss of calcium in their bones at 50 years of age diagnosed with a DEXA scan in a screening prevention so they do not get a collapsed vertebra or break a hip you put them on a medicine The medicines are expensive there is no question but they really do work Some medicines work for some people other medicines work for others Once you do a DEXA scan under Medicare rules you cannot do another one for 2 years So you cannot check to see if the medicine is working after 6 months to see if you see an improvement in the calcification of a womans bones because Medicare said it is too expensive and we are doing too many of them Rather than go after the fraud in DEXA scans what they did was ration the care Here we have a woman and you have diagnosed her properly You have started her on the medicine but you have to wait 2 years What happens during that period of time if you are given a medicine that is not working effectively Because it did not work in her case you have to wait 2 years and her osteoporosis advances and she falls and breaks her hip because Medicare said we were doing too many of them Take what CMS did to all the oncologists in this country They said we are paying too much money for EPOGEN EPOGEN is an acronym for erythropoietin which is a chemical that is kicked out by your kidneys to cause you to make red blood cells When you get chemotherapy for breast cancer or colon cancer like I have had sometimes that chemotherapy not only kills your cancer but it kills your blood cells Because we were using too much EPOGEN Medicare put out a rule rationing EPOGEN and said Unless you have a hemoglobin of X amount you cannot get a shot of EPOGEN and by the way you cannot take your own money and buy it either The doctor will get fined if he gives it to you if you dont meet the guideline What happens For 80 percent of the patients it worked fine But for those patients who have other comorbidother conditions such as congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseemphysemawhere significant drops in hemoglobin can cause organ failures in other parts of the body there was no exception made by CMS for a physician to make a judgment and say This rule should not apply here because this patient is going to end up in the hospital My oncologist told me a story of one of his patients who could not get EPOGEN It ended up that their heart failure was exacerbated because they got anemic from the chemotherapy ended up on a ventilator in ICU and died Why did they die Because they got heart failure Why did they get heart failure Because they got too anemic Why did they get too anemic Because Medicare would not allow the doctors to give them the medicine What is wrong with the bill what is wrong with the Mikulski amendment is we rely on government bureaucracies to make the decisions about care rather than the trained learned experienced truly caring caregivers in this country to make those decisions Instead of going after the fraud in Medicare which is well in excess of 90 billion a year we decided we will ration care The authors of this bill are going to say No that is not true But when I offered amendments in committee to prohibit rationing of Medicare servicesto prohibit itit was voted down Every person who voted for moving on this bill voted against the rationing Why would they do that Because ultimately the feeling is We know better Washington knows better We know your patients better We know how to practice medicine better We are going to take ivory tower doctors who do not have real practices anymore we are going to take retired researchers and we are going to tell you how to practice And we are going to save money by limiting what you can get The chairman of the Finance Committee has said we do not truly cut Medicare Advantage that the services are not reduced The chairmans own bill on page 869 subtitle C part CI wont go through reading itreduces Medicare Advantage payments The differential from 135 toI will read it to the chairman The chairman is shaking his head Let me read it to him Let me also reference what CBO has said I will be happy to yield to the chairman if he wants to talk now No required reductions in what President will the Senator yield for a minute Reserving the right to object I will ask for 2 additional minutes for my side How about 1 The first comment I have is about relying on what Wall Street analysts say today They have about this much credibility in this country today Look at the economic situation we find ourselves in because of what Wall Street analysts have said That is the first point I would make The second point is that the majority whip yesterday said we should cut Medicare Advantage because of the 14 percent Senator Dodd just recently went after the Patients Choice Act because we actually make it be competitively bid without any reduction in benefits Your bill for every Medicare Advantage cuts 50 percent of the benefits out It cuts the benefits The difference isand I agree with the majority whipwe do need to have the savings in Medicare Advantage but the way you get that is through competitively bidding it while at the same time maintaining the requirements for the benefits that are offered There is a big difference in those two Ours ends up being pure savings to save Medicare The savings in this bill are to create a new entitlement The other point I wish to make is if you are a senior out there listening and if you are going to be subject to the new increase in Medicare tax for the first time in history we are going to take the Medicare tax and not use it for Medicare we are going to use it for something else under this bill This onehalf of 1 percent is now going to be consumed in something outside of Medicare So no longer do we have a Medicare tax for the Medicare trust fund We have a Medicare tax that funds the Medicare trust fund plus other programs I say to my colleagues I think we want a lot of the same things How we go about itthe Senator from Montana recognized the fact that we are going to increase payments to primary care physicians Ask yourself the question why only 1 in 50 doctors last year who graduated from medical school is going into primary care Why do you think that is Could it be that the government that is setting the payment rates created a maldistribution in remuneration to primary care physicians therefore they choose to go where they can make 200 percent more over their lifetime by spending 1 additional year in residency rather than doing primary care What this bill does and what the Senator from Arizona is trying to do by sending this bill back is to refocus it on the fact that Medicare money ought to be used for Medicare If in fact we are going to slow the growth of Medicare can we do that without cutting benefits To slow the growth in this bill for 11 million Americans who now have Medicare Advantage will diminish their benefits That is out of the 120 billion that is going to come You cannot tell a senior who is in a rural area today who is on the economic lower rungs of the ladder who uses Medicare Advantage to equalize their care with somebody who can afford a Medicare supplemental policy you cannot tell them this is not going to decrease their benefits and their care because it is And in the bill it actually states that it is going to decrease their benefits The Senator would probably be interested to knowand I know my colleagues on the other sidethat the American Medical Association now represents less than 10 percent of the actively practicing physicians in this country The physicians as a whole in this country are adamantly opposed to this bill The reason they are opposed to this bill is because you are inserting the government between them and their patient That is why they are opposed to this bill So you have the endorsement of the AMA which represents less than 10 percent of the practicing doctorsactively practicing doctorsin this country because not only will it increase payments but CPT code revenue is protected That is the revenue AMA gathers from the payment system that continues to be fostered in this bill which is their main source of revenue One of the questions and one of the promises was If you have what you have now and you like it you can keep it What is happening under this bill for 11 million seniors on Medicare Advantage that is not going to happen If they like it they are not going to be able to keep what they have You cant deny that That is the truth Medicare Advantage needs to be reformed There is no question about it I agree As the Senator alluded to in the Patients Choice Act we actually save 160 billion in the Patients Choice Act but we dont diminish any of the benefits and we do that because CMS failed to competitively bid it because when it was writtenand I understand who wrote itwhen it was written we didnt make them competitively bid it You could get the same savings actually get more savings and not reduce benefits in any amount if you competitively bid that product But we have decided we are not going to do that The second point I make with my colleagues is the vast majority of people on Medicare Advantage are on the lower bottom economically They cant afford an AARP supplemental bill They cant afford to pay an extra 150 or 200 a month So what happens most of the time with Medicare Advantage is we bring people up to what everybody else in Medicare gets because most people can afford84 percent of the people in this country can afford to buy a Medicare supplemental policy because Medicare doesnt cover everything Your idea to try to save money I agree with But cutting the benefits I do not agree with You are right Senator Dodd the basic guaranteed benefits have to be supplied to Medicare Advantage and then the things above that which you get from the supplemental policy what you can afford to buy is what these people get And what you are taking away from poorest of our elderly is the ability to have the same care that people get who can afford to buy a supplemental policy That is the difference I appreciate my chairman for his courtesy in yielding the time Reclaiming my time I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record CBO 11212009 which shows an average from 135 down to 51 per month on the average Medicare Advantage beneficiary There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE MA PROVISIONS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON ENROLLMENT IN MA PLANS AND ON FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR ENROLLEES IN MA PLANS OF BENEFITS NOT COVERED BY MEDICARE Under Current Law Enrollment in MA Plans millions

06 43 47 More than 100 Percent of Spending Per Beneficiary in the FeeforService Sector a The estimate of a 105 billion net reduction in Medicare spending over the 20102019 period reflects a 118 billion reduction in Medicare payments that would be offset in part by a 13 billion reduction in Part B premium receipts Note Under current law extra benefits include health care services net covered by Medicare such as vision care and dental care and subsidies of beneficiaries outofpocket costs for Part B or Part D premiums or cost sharing for Medicarecovered benefits Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act extra benefits would include health care services not covered by Medicare and subsidies of beneficiaries outof pocket costs for cost sharing for Medicarecovered benefits The fact is if you like what you have you cannot keep it for 26 million Americans You can say that is not true That is what CBO says Here are their numbers They sent the report to the chairman I agree with the chairman that they are overpaid This morning the claim made by the chairman and Senator Dodd is that Medicare Advantage is not Medicare Medicare Advantage is Medicare law It was signed into law It is a part of Medicare The chairman would agree with that How did we get there How did we get there How did we get there to where they are overpaid We have an organization called the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services They are the ones who let the contract are they not They in fact are Twentyfive percent of the overpayment has to be rebated to CMS today the Senator would agree with that Seventyfive percent for extra benefits 25 percent rebate How did we get to where they are overpaid Because we have a governmentcentered organization that is incompetent in terms of how they accomplished the implementation of that bill What was said by Senator Dodd this morningand I confronted him already on it but it bears repeatingis that the Patients Choice Act eliminates the dollars without eliminating the services because it mandates competitive bidding with no elimination in services for Medicare Advantage So if you want to save money competitively bid rather than go through eight pages of reductions year by year in the payments that go back to Medicare Advantage We have this complicated formula that nobody who listens to this debate would understand I know the chairman understands it because he helped write it But the fact is 26 million Americans according to CBO will see a significant change in their Medicare benefits Medicare Advantage is Medicare Part C We have had a kind of a differential made that it isnt really Medicare It is Medicare And 20 percent of the people in this country who are on Medicare are on Medicare Part C Medicare Advantageand they like it And why do they like it Because most of them dont have enough money to buy a supplemental Medicare policy to cover the costs that are associated with deductibles and copays and outliers So I agree with the chairman that Medicare Advantage is overpaid but I disagree with the way you are going about getting there I also disagree with taking any of the money that is now being spent on Medicare Part C and creating another program I think all that money ought to be put back into the longevity of Medicare In case you dont understand how impactful that is we now owe in the next 75 yearsactually we dont owe it because none of the Senators sitting here will be around Our kids are going to get to pay back 44 trillion in money for Medicare we will have spent that we allowed to grow in fraud close to 100 billion a year and then did nothing about it This bill does essentially nothing about that 100 billion a year or 1 trillion every 10 years If we were to eliminate thatwhich this bill does notwe would markedly extend the life and lower the debt that is going to come to our children That leads me to the other important aspect of the health care debate We know when you take out the funny accountingthe Enron accountingin this bill and you match up revenues with expenses you are talking about a 25 trillion bill The chairman of the Finance Committee readily admits he has it paid for and CBO says you have it paid for But how does he pay for it He pays for it with the 26 million people who like what they have today and who are going to lose what they have today He pays for it by raising Medicare taxes Then the Medicare taxes he raises he doesnt spend on Medicare he spends that on a new entitlement program Think about what we are doing Is there a better way to accomplish what we are doing I thank the chairman for indulging me and allowing me to continue this long I will wind up with a couple of statements and then share the floor with him You know after practicing medicine for 25 years I know we have a lot of problems in health care and I appreciate the efforts of the chairman of the Finance Committee to try to find a solution for them It is not a bipartisan solution but it is a solution And it is a solution that grows the government It puts the government in charge of health care and creates blind bureaucracies that step between you and your doctor That is one way of doing it But wouldnt a better way be to do the following Lets incentivize people to do the right thing rather than building bureaucracies and mandating how they will do it Wouldnt it be better to incentivize tort reform in the States Wouldnt it be better to incentivize physicians based on outcomes Wouldnt it be better to incentivize good behavior by medical supply companies DME drug companies hospitals physicians through accountable care organizations through transparency for both quality and price We dont have any of that in here What we have is a government centered bureaucracy that according to CBO figures will add 25000 Federal employees to implement this program25000 If you call the Federal Government how long does it take you now to get an answer Yet we are going to add 25000 employees just in health care That is an extrapolation of the amount of agencies dividing what CBO says per agency and per cost they will come up with Wouldnt it be better to fix the things that are broken rather than to try to fix all of health care I heard one of my colleagues today say on the floor and I think it is true that people in America are upset with us and I think rightly so I apologize to the American people for my arrogance I apologize to the American people for the arrogance of this bill the thinking that we got it right that we can fix it in Washington that we dont have to listen to the people out there that we dont have to listen to the people who are actually experiencing the consequences of what we are going to do I apologize for the arrogance of saying we can create a 25 trillion program and that we know best Well you know what we dont know what is best As Senator Alexander has said so many times what needs to happen is we need to start over We need to protect the best of American medicine And what is the best Well if you get sick anywhere in the world this is the best place in the world to get sick whether you have insurance or not If you have heart disease or atherosclerotic disease this is the best place in the world It costs too much there is no question but it is the best place If you have cancer you are onethird more likely to live and be cured of that cancer living in this country than anywhere else in the worldfor any cancer It just costs too much This bill doesnt address the true causes of the cost What are the true causes of the cost Well No 1 we know Medicare and Medicaid underpay and so we get a cost shift that is 1700 per year per family in this country So you get to pay three taxes in this country on health care You pay your regular income tax which goes to pay for Medicaid and it also now starting to pay for Medicare as well you have to pay 145 percent plus your employer gets to pay 145 percent of every dollar you earn for Medicare and then your health insurance costs 1700 more per year because Medicaid and Medicare dont compensate for the actual cost of the care because of the government centered role that is played in terms of the mandates the rules and regulations We have a tort system in this country that costs upward of 200 billion in waste a year which is 8 percent of the cost Ninety percent of all cases are settled with no wrong found at all on the part of caregivers and of the remaining 10 percent only 3 percent find anything wrong Of 97 percent of all the cases only 10 percent go to trial and 73 percent of that 10 percent are found in favor of the providers So we spend all this money practicing defensive medicine and there is not one thing in this bill to fix that problem That is 8 percent Take your health care premium or your percentage of your health care premium and apply 8 percent and that is going down the drain because I am ordering tests you dont need but I need to protect myself in case somebody tries to extort money from me with a lawsuit that I know is going to get thrown out but I have to have it there to prove it And then we have inefficiencies Ultimately what we need to do is to protect what is good incentivize the correct behavior in what is wrong and go after the fraud in health care with a vengeanceput doctors in jail hospital administrators in jail Dont slap them with a fine and ban them from Medicare Put them in jail The people who are stealing our grandkids money up to 100 billion a year need to go to jail We play pay and chase We pay everybody and then we try to figure out whether they deserve to get paid Nobody else does that but the government does and that is who we are getting ready to put in charge of another 25 trillion worth of health care One of the reasons health care is in trouble in this country is that 61 percent of all the health care is run through the government today Look at TRICARE for our military look at VA care look at Indian health care at SCHIP and Medicaid There is an estimate of 15 billion a year in fraud in New York City alone on Medicaid That is one estimate per year in one city on Medicaid And then Medicare And we are going to say those are running so good that we ought to move another 25 trillion or 15 percent of health care to where we are at 76 percent of all health care is run by the government I reject that out of hand until we can demonstrate we are good at what we do What we ought to be doing is turning it back The private sector isnt the answer to everything I agree with that I cant stand 80 percent of the insurance bureaucrats I deal with But at least I have a fighting chance because they will call me back when I need to do something for a patient I never get a call back from Medicare They do not call me back The State doesnt call me back on Medicaid when I need to do something So I go on and do it and find somebody else to pay for it That is the kind of system we have today Think about the mothers in this country in a Medicaid system where 40 percent of the primary care doctors in this country wont see their children That is Medicaid That is realistic Medicaid today in our country So they have a sick kid but they cant get in to a doctor even though they have insurance They have Medicaid but they cant get in Why cant they get in Because only 1 in 50 doctors last year who graduated from medical school goes into primary care We have created an abrupt shortage in primary care And No 2 the payment is not enough to pay for the overhead to see the child So you have a weepy woman who is worried about her sick kid and care is delayed if you cant get in It doesnt matter if you have Medicaid if you cant be seen So what happens She goes to the emergency room What happens in the emergency room We spend three or four times as much as we should because that is an emergency department The doctor has no knowledge of the child or the mother He doesnt want to get sued so we have a 40 percent defensive medicine cost in the emergency room The answer is not more government health care The answer is creating the incentives for people to do the right thing The only way we get things under control in health care in this country and the only way we create access for people in this country is to decrease the cost of health care This bill doesnt decrease the cost of health care If we want to make sure we do what is best for American medicine while we fix what is wrong we will do it one significant part at a time I cant imagine dealing with thousands tens of thousands of more bureaucrats in health care and I cant imagine the impact it is going to have between me and my patients It is going to severely impact them Do I want everybody in this country to have available care Yes 15 percent of my practice was gratis for people who had no care who had no money That is true with a lot of physicians out there in this country It is true with a lot of labs It is true with a lot of hospitals It is true with a lot of the providers in this country They are caring people We are going to tie them up We are going to put regulations and ropes around them We are going to mandate rules and regulations and we in our arrogant wisdom are going to tell Americans how they are going to get their health care I certainly hope not But I am not thinking about me I am thinking about our kids and our grandkids I will end with one last comment ThomsonReuters in a study put out October 9 of this yearit is a very wellrespected firmtheir estimate of the 24 trillion that we spend on health care per year in this country is that between 600 and 850 billion of it is pure waste Defensive medicine costs and malpractice is between 250 billion to 325 billion by their estimate Not one thing in this bill to address thatnot one thing Fraud there is between 125 and 175 billion per yearinsignificant in this bill 2 billion to 3 billion Administrative inefficiency 17 percentbetween 100 and 150 billion wasted on paperwork in health care every year Provider errorsthat is mebetween 75 and 100 billion that is either wrong diagnosis or failure to treat appropriately It is the smallest of all What are we doing We are going to tell the providersthe hospitals the medical device companies the drug companies the doctors the radiologists the labs the physical therapistswe are going to tell them how to do it That is not where the problem is My hope is that the American people will come to their senses and say Wait a minute Slow down Stop Fix the important things Fix the worst thing first the next thing second the next thing third the next thing fourth The unintended consequences of this bill are going to be unbelievable Nobody is smart enough to figure all this out nobody Nobody on my staff nobody on the Finance Committee nobody in Majority Leader Reids office can predict all the unintended consequences that are going to come about because of this bill The chairman has been awfully patient and I see my colleague here to offer an amendment With that I yield the floor The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Burris The Senator from Oregon is recognized

Hampshire I cannot fault the Senator from Montana for his efforts to get a bipartisan solution As I have said many times I am sorry he had to be cut off by phony time deadlines that kept us from reaching that kind of a solution and then winding up with things that are in this bill we are talking about that were not a part of our discussions again the things that were proposed by people on this side of the aisle that are not in that bill There were some possibilities for solutions But we wound up with that same situation of We won the election we get to write the bill and it has to be done quickly So I am disappointed in the whole process There has been a bipartisan proposal The chairman of the Budget Committee and the ranking member of the Budget Committee have proposed a commission and that bipartisan deal is being chastised here So we are on the bill where 64 percent of the amendments that have been filed so far were filed by the Democrats and I keep wondering why they are filibustering their own bill Then when something bipartisan does come up they are opposed to that too I know they think the only good ideas come from the other side of the aisle and I do get frustrated with that President I appreciate the statistics the Senator from Montana cited about how long we have been debating this and how many amendments we have done That is how few amendments we have done actually The majority is now filibustering their own bill I have no idea why that is happening We have been calling for votes on both of these amendments that have been proposed so far and havent been able to get the votes I dont understand how they can talk about how many amendments are being done I also have to voice some other frustration I dont know how many times I have heard the exact same speech by the Senator from Illinois Mr Durbin on this floor talking about the amount of hours that have been spent together working on these bills in the HELP Committee and the Gang of 6 in the Finance Committee It isnt about how many hours we spend together It isnt about how many hours we spend on the floor It is whether we are accepting ideas I understand the other party won the last election but somehow they will have to get over this attitude that they won the election they get to write the bill they dont have to take any ideas from anybody else In the HELP Committee I keep pointing out that most of the things we turned in were kind of punctuation corrections and spelling corrections Any ideas we actually had that appeared to be accepted to be in the bill were ripped out of the bill before it was actually formally printed without talking to us What kind of bipartisan deal is that Another thing with the HELP Committee we have only had 10 days of debate on this We did more than that in the HELP Committee when we were marking up the bill But we are having in the words of Yogi Berra deja vu all over again When we were having that markup the majority withheld a significant part of the bill a big part of the bill It was the governmentrun option part of the bill They wouldnt give us the wording on that I think they were still writing it Maybe that is what is happening right now too But we couldnt get the text we were going to write amendments on so that we could deal with the bill I think America noticed that in August People said How come everybody isnt reading the bill You cant read what you dont have The point I am making is right now the newspapers are full of informationwell speculation it has to be speculationabout what this new Medicare expansion does I havent run into anybody who has seen the text of that I have asked some of the media and they didnt see the text They got a briefing We havent even had a briefing The majority side has had a briefing but our folks who have talked to those folks said Wow that was pretty general How could you make up your mind on whether you are going to support it based on the little bit of information you received That is not the way to run any kind of an organization especially if you want bipartisan votes You cant write the bill in secret which is what was done with this bill There wasnt a Republican involved in the behindthedoor stuff Leader Reid did to put together the bill we have now That is not bipartisan There hasnt been a single person from the Republican side briefed on this new proposal that is going to save the world Actually I noticed that the American Medical Association suddenly left the bill and said This will be the worst thing that could happen to us The hospital associations which have been strong supporters of the bill have also said this wont work particularly the Mayo Clinic which we have been holding up as one of the prime examples of the way to do health care saying If this Medicare expansion happens it will cost us millions We wont be able to provide the kind of care we have been providing What is the deal around here When are we going to actually get to see something When is the majority actually going to share with us this marvelous idea they have had What kind of a way to run a business is that Are we going to recess for the weekend I dont want to recess for the weekend I am conscious of the 11 days we have been debating and we have only covered 14 amendments We have a lot of important amendments that either will be a part of the bill or will help the people in this country to understand what is being thrust on them There has never been a bill of such importance as this one from the standpoint of how many people it affects We are talking about reforming health care in America That is everybody That is every single individual every single provider Every single business will be affected by this bill We talk about 2074 pages which seems like a lot It would be for a normal bill that you could debate in a limited period which is what we are being asked to do But 2074 pages isnt nearly enough to cover health care for America So why is it only 2074 pages There are hundreds of references in there to how the Secretary of Health and Human Services is going to solve all the problems The things we arent able to put into detail in there we just assign to her and she will magically be able to solve the problems for American health care After all it is her Department But that is not going to happen You cant give that many assignments to any agency any department any group of people and expect them in a reasonable amount of time to come up with solutions solutions that ought to be decided on by this body the elected officialsnot appointed officials but elected officials That is not going to happen with this bill The only way that could happen is if we took significant parts of it and put it up one piece at a time and solved it That is what seniors are asking for They are asking for us to take the Medicare part and give them some assurance that when we are through it will work We are not even getting to see a significant part of it We have been pointing out how taking 464 billion out of Medicare will break it will ruin it You just cant steal 464 billion out of Medicare and have it come out good The majority recognizes that That is why they put in the special commission that is going to come to us each and every year and suggest the kinds of cuts we ought to make to keep that solvent The biggest thing we ought to do is take these cuts that are provided and make them actually apply only to Medicare But how are you going to fund the expansion of Medicare now down to age 55 How do you do that I guess you charge a premium to those people That is kind of the rumor that is out there How big of a premium How big of a premium are you going to thrust on those people I suspect it is going to be the older and the sicker people in that 55 to 64age category who are going to want to shift over to Medicare If it is a higher premium so the system stays solventhaving nothing to do of course with age because we cannot do that under the bill or sickness because we cannot do that under the billand those are good ideasbut those better be up in that range of the highrisk pools that the States already have People come to me and say You have to do something about health care because we cannot afford that highrisk pool it is too expensive Well how much more are we going to expect the young people to pitch in in their paycheck That is where the Medicare money comes from right now They deduct a portion of the paycheck from every single working American and that goes into Medicare and gets paid out right away to Medicare recipients none of whom or hardly any of whom are the ones paying into the system They are hoping that system is going to be there when they get older What I am asking for is for the majority to show us the paper and give us a reasonable time to look at it and give America a reasonable time to look at it I do not think it is unreasonable for that to be on the Internet That is a significant part of the bill That would be a significant bill all by itself It was held from our view when the HELP Committee did it Incidentally that HELP Committee billthat was put together in 2 weeks without our help and put on usparts of it were withheld as this has been withheld until the last minute and then thrust in That is what created this enormous outrage across America of Did you read the bill How can you read the bill if you have not seen anything in it if it has not been given to you I do not think it is intended to be given to us until we have to shuffle this thing through at the end The anticipation was to get this done by Christmastime and the majority side keeps talking about getting this done by Christmastime Will we have time to read it before Christmastime Will we have a chance to do any amendments on it before Christmastime I am willing to stay around and work through the weekend and keep doing amendments but I would like to see this marvelous idea that is going to solve the whole problem If it was that marvelous and that good of an idea I think it would be shared already Mr President I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Montana We have not even seen this new piece Nobody wants to show us the new piece They keep talking about it They have leaked it to the newspapers but they will not show it to us and then they keep talking about how this bill is going to solve the deficits for this country that there is 157 billion or something saved in the first 10 years That is onlyonlyif you use the phoney accounting they are using It is only if you dont do the doc fix It is only if you dont solve the myriad of other things we have brought out We have a bill they keep talking about as being the solution America has figured it out but the Democrats havent figured it out I see the leader is on the Senate floor I yield the floor Recognition of the Minority Leader The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Republican leader is recognized President it is my understanding the leader spoke under leader time So we should have an adequate 10 minutes to allocate to the Senator 
S_IA_GRASSLEY,2009-12-03,1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009; 1981_2009,0201; 0202; 0203; 0197; 0198; 0199; 0200; 0204; 0205, But I do not think the Senator wants to go down that road because do not forget there are 6 years of programs of expenditures and there is 10 years of revenue coming in If you want to play that game you can pay down the entire national debt I cannot respond to that because I do not know that for sure So I do not want to respond But if you tell me I tend to believe everything you tell me President as I stated earlier the Bennet amendment as written does not protect Medicare So I have a modification I would like to present that ensures Medicare savings in this bill are not being siphoned off to finance a new and separate entitlement program To that end I ask unanimous consent to modify the amendment by adding the following before the period at the end of subsection b and furthermore that notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or amendment made by this Act net Medicare savings specified in the most recent estimate available from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office before enactment are appropriated to the Secretary and shall be used for such purposes and to maintain Medicare policies for home health services skilled nursing facility services hospice care hospital services and benefits provided by the Medicare Advantage program as under the provisions of such Title as specified on the day before the date of enactment of this Act End of my amendment President I would like to also make a statement related to the amendment that is being presented by the Senator from Colorado Speaking for several Members on my sidehopefully for all the Members on my sidewe are very concerned as I think we have all made clear by now that the Medicare savings in this bill are being used not for preserving Medicare but instead are being used to finance the creation of a new Federal entitlement program My understanding of the purpose of the amendment of the Senator from Colorado is to indicate that Medicare savings will be used for extending the solvency of Medicare and the trust fund reducing Medicare premiums and other cost sharing for beneficiaries and to improve or expand Medicare benefits and access to providers Nobody can argue with that purpose the Senator has expressed or his amendment expresses But the concern on our side that we have with this amendment is it does not require that the savings from Medicare would onlywith emphasis upon the word onlybe used for that purpose As the Congressional Budget Office has made clear the cuts in Medicare in this bill are not being used solely for Medicare as the Senators amendment suggests but instead are being used mostly to fund the creation of an entirely new and separate subsidy program For the Senator to accomplish what he intends to accomplish would require entirely different language to ensure that savings from Medicare in this bill would only be used to protect Medicare benefits for seniors as the law now expresses The right approach would include language making sure seniors have the same access as they have today to home health services skilled nursing facilities and services hospice care hospital services preventive benefits and the benefits provided in the Medicare Advantage Program So the Senate it seems to me should also ensure that Medicare savings in this bill are not being siphoned off to finance a new and separate entitlement program It is very clear to meand I hope we are able to make it clear to people all 100 Senatorsthat the Bennet amendment as written does not protect Medicare I yield the floor President I will take a short minute to respond to a question But our side has 7 Could we discuss this maybe a little bit later what you brought up Then if I may President I would like to make very clear that this objection confirms that the Bennet amendment does not protect Medicare as the other side claims that it protects Medicare I yield the floor President today I am introducing the Clean Renewable Energy Advancement Tax Extension Jobs Act of 2009 or the CREATE Jobs Act of 2009 for short This is a bill to help all kinds of businesses create jobs and continue pushing ahead on the development of clean renewable energy My bill extends the tax credit for the production of electricity from wind and openloop biomass through December 31 2016 It increases the amount of bond authority for new clean renewable energy bonds to incentivize more clean renewable energy projects and the jobs created by these projects For all businesses my bill extends bonus depreciation for 1 year so that businesses are able to deduct half of the value of any property placed in service in 2010 This tax cut for businesses that invest in new property in 2010 will spur investment in clean energy projects as well as other new projects and that will create badly needed jobs I

outset I respect very much my colleague from the State of Kansas He and I have worked on many issues together In fact we traveled together to Africa a memorable trip for both of us I am sure visiting the Democratic Republic of Congo Rwanda and meeting a lot of people in desperate straits I thank him for that I know he is now preparing for another public career in the State of Kansas with the blessing of the Kansas voters But in the meantime he continues to be a very important vital voice in the Senate I thank him for that as well We do disagree on health care reform I know he has had a chance to explain his point of view I will say I disagree with many of his conclusions about what we are about what we are trying to accomplish This is the bill that is before us when we return to the health care reform debate It is 2074 pages long It is the product of 1 years work by two major committees in the Senate The House of Representatives spent a similar period of time in three different committees working on it to come up with their work product which they passed just a few weeks ago This is historic because we have been promising this and threatening this and talking about this for decades It was Theodore Roosevelt who first raised the question about whether America could accept the challenge of providing health care for every citizen That was over 100 years ago Then of course Harry Truman who in a more modern era issued the same challenge He was confronted by his critics who said He is talking about socializing medicine Must be socialism that Harry Truman is proposing The idea died Then again Lyndon Johnson raised it in the early 1960s He was a master of the Senate as he has been characterized in a book that has been written about him He believed he had the power to make this happen to deal with the health care system across the board in America It turned out he made a significant contribution with the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid but could not reach the goal of universal health care or comprehensive health care reform This President President Obama came to us and issued the same challenge He said we have reached a point of no return The current health care system in America is unsustainable it is unaffordable and the cost of health care goes up dramatically Ten years ago a family of four paid an average of 6000 a year 500 a month for health care insurance Now that is up to twice that amount 12000 average for a family of four 1000 a month In 8 years with projected increases in costs we expect that the monthly premium for the family of four to go up to 2000 a month 24000 a year We know that represents 40 percent of earnings for many people That is absolutely unsustainable What we have tried to do first and foremost is address affordability How can we make health insurance protection more affordable for more families How can we start lessening the annual increase in premiums and actually help people by substantially cutting the cost of premiums for many families It is a big challenge and we have I think risen to the challenge with this bill The other side of the aisle has ideas they have amendments they have speeches they have charts but they do not have a comprehensive health care reform bill They do not have a bill that has been sent over to the Congressional Budget Office carefully read and evaluated It took weeks to do it They do not have a bill that came back from the Congressional Budget Office considered to be the neutral observer of action on Capitol Hill They do not have a bill that came back from the CBO that has been characterized as actually reducing the deficit This bill according to the Congressional Budget Office will reduce Americas deficit over the next 10 years by 130 billion and over the following 10 years another 650 billion It is not just dealing with health care reform it is dealing with the costs of health care to our government and reducing our expenditures by significant amounts It is the largest deficitreduction bill ever considered on the floor of the Senate Although the Republicans have many ideas they do not have anything that matches this bill in terms of deficit reduction or bringing down the cost of health care They have not produced a bill which will extend the reach of health insurance coverage to 94 percent of our people in this country which this bill does For the first time in the history of the United States of America 94 percent of our American citizens will have peace of mind knowing they have health insurance Today 50 million do not This bill will take 30 million off the uninsured rolls and put them in insurance plans that can protect their families and it will help them pay for the premiums If people are making less than 400 percent of povertywhich in laymans terms is about 80000 a year in income If your family makes 80000 or less we provide in this bill that we will help you pay for your premiums The lower your income the more we will help pay If you are making for example as an individual less than 14000 a year you will not pay for your health care It will be covered by Medicaid the program that is now nationwide and you will not have to pay a premium Then as you make more money you will pay a little bit of a premium with help from this bill The Republicans have not produced a plan of any kind that deals with helping families of limited means modest means pay for their health insurance premiums We have The Congressional Budget Office has scored it One of the major provisions in this billand one I think most people will identify with quicklyis the fact that health insurance reform is included too There is a Patients Bill of Rights in this bill It basically says we should bring an end to the discriminatory practices of health insurance companies against American citizens We know what we are talking about Friends of mine a family I am closer to than any other family in Springfield IL has a son fighting cancer He is a young man in his forties He has young children in high school He was diagnosed with melanoma just a few years ago His oncologist has worked with him with chemotherapy and radiation and with the kind of treatment and drugs and surgeries he needed As a result of it he has gone through some tough surgeries and tough treatment His oncologist said at one point We have a drug we believe will help you He gave him the drug and the drug in fact arrested the development of his cancer Shortly after the drug was prescribed and administered his health insurance company that he paid into for years came back and said We will not cover that drug The drug costs 12000 a month It is impossible for him as the coach of a baseball team at one of our universities to come up with that kind of money His family borrowed money to pay for one of the treatments and now they are suing the insurance company in the hopes that they can get coverage After all those years paying in when they finally needed that coverage they turned him down I hope he wins that lawsuit This is a very profitable insurance company It is a company that should be paying but they are not That is one example of thousands we could talk about The purpose of this bill is to make sure a friend of mine his family and other families just like his have a fighting chance against these insurance companies We say in this bill we are going to provide a way for protection for people with a preexisting condition that if you have a history of high cholesterol or high blood pressure if you have some cancer in your family it is not going to disqualify you You are still going to be eligible for health insurance a policy you can afford We also say when it comes to your childrenyou know how it is today you learn the hard waywhen your kids who are on the family plan reach the age of 24 they are off We extend that to age 26 which I think is a little more peace of mind particularly for students graduating from college looking for jobs these days It is not easy We want to make sure they are covered with health insurance while they are paying off their student loans and building their career That is in this bill There is not a bill from the Republican side of the aisle that deals with the Patients Bill of Rights In fact it is a rare Senator on the other side of the aisle who even stands and is critical of health insurance companies in the way they are treating people in this country I do not know if my friends on the other side of the aisle get back home enough to meet with some of these families Surely they do They must receive mail that tells them about these stories we have all heard about You would think they would be endorsing our approach in this bill Instead they are critical of it from start to finish They talk a lot about taxes I want you to know under this bill if you have a small business with 25 or fewer employees we actually provide tax breaks to help you provide insurance for your employees There are a lot of businesses momandpop businesses for example that cannot afford health insurance that will have a chance now because of tax breaks here Then when it comes to paying for premiums I mentioned earlier if you make 80000 or less we provide tax breaks in helping you pay for it The cost of it in tax breaks is 440 billion over 10 years It is a huge amount of money we are providing to American citizens to give them a chance to pay for their health insurance premiums All we hear from the other side is Oh this bill is going to raise taxes It does raise some It raises taxes on health insurance companies for what we call Cadillac health care policies We can debate for a long time whether that level of policy 25000 is a reasonable level or should be something different But the fact is it is a tax on the health insurance company It will likely result in fewer policies that are that grand and that expansive being issued I think this is a bill that moves in the right direction It is a bill that makes insurance more affordable It is a bill that does not increase the deficit it reduces it It is a bill that gives people a fighting chance against health insurance companies that discriminate against their customers It is a bill that extends the coverage of health insurance of 94 percent of Americans It is a bill that looks at putting Medicare on sound footing It adds 5 years of solvency to Medicare5 years There has not been a bill produced on the other side of the aisle that even adds 1 year that I am aware of It adds 5 more years of solvency That is the reason why this bill has been supported by the American Association of Retired Persons We have support of medical professionals senior organizations and consumer groups all across America They know as we do we cannot wait any longer I also wish to make the point that the Senate bill offers significant savings for seniors The CMS Actuary projects a net 469 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings over 10 years slightly more than the Congressional Budget Office It extends the life of the Medicare trust fund according to the Office of the Actuary by 9 years That is longer than anyone has projected in previous forecasts but it is a significant increase almost doubling the life of the Medicare trust fund over what it currently would be It reduces premiums by 1250 a month by the year 2019 or 300 per couple per year Slowing Medicare growth will lower health care costs for seniors as well as younger Americans Not only will there be a premium savings but coinsurance will fall as well The Senate bill slows the growth of health care costs The Actuary report we have for example says Reductions in Medicare payment updates for providers the actions of the Independent Medicare Advisory Board and the excise tax on highcost employersponsored health insurance would have a significant downward impact on future health care cost growth rates The bend in the health care cost curve is evident Health care costs under the Senate bill begin to decline as cost savings begin to kick in I have not mentioned this bill focuses on prevention and wellness too If there is one thing we need it is to encourage people to take care of themselves and to get a helping hand for the tests they need to stay healthy and to monitor their conditions This preventive care and wellness though we have not been credited by the Congressional Budget Office is an important element of this bill I think there is one thing on which we should all agree The cost of health care particularly for small businesses is very difficult On the Senate floor both Democrats and my friends on the other side of the aisle have recognized small businesses are struggling to pay for health insurance But there is a real difference We have offered a solution one that is comprehensive and one that has been scored and carefully analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office Unfortunately that has not happened on the other side Their approach is basically to criticize what we have proposed but to offer no alternative If they are happy with the current system I understand that If they will concede that it is hard to produce a bill like this I would understand that But merely to criticize this without alternative a comprehensive alternative that has been carefully analyzed I dont think is a responsible approach to the serious problem that we face today There are reallife stories of people who have contacted me One of them I will tell you about involves a small business Right now we know that one sick employee of a small business can drive the cost of health care for the whole company to limits where they just cant afford it My friends Martha and Harry Burrows whom I have met are small business owners in Chicago and they have to wrestle with this problem and try to run a successful business at the same time When they opened their toy store Timeless Toys 16 years ago they promised to provide health insurance to their fulltime employees Martha Burrows said Since we were covered we wanted to offer the same benefit to our employees But as their health care premiums have skyrocketed with leaps of more than 20 percent at a time the commitment has taken its toll on their business Providing health insurance to their fulltime staff of seven meant cuts not only to profits but also to the wages of their employees In general the older employees faced even higher costs We shouldnt put our Nations employers in a position where the health costs of an older worker can make such a huge difference Marcia says I dont like making decisions that way I want to base hiring decisions on the quality of the person The legislation on the floor incidentally deals with the rating of premium costs for senior citizens for example and makes a fairer rating system Currently health insurance companies in America are exempt from the antitrust laws Under a bill known as MCCarran Ferguson passed in the 1940s they are exempt along with organized baseball which means the insurance companieshealth insurance companies and otherscan literally sit down in a room and conspire collude agree on prices they are going to charge If any other companies that were supposed to be competing did that in America they would be sued but not the insurance companies So they can set premiums and agree on what the premiums will be and they can divide up the market for the sale of their products sending some companies to one town and some to another making sure they do not compete against one another That is the reality of health insurance today What we provide in this bill is protection against the ratings which discriminate against people because they are elderly or because they are women We put limits to the rating differences that will be allowed in health insurance policies There is no bill I know of from the Republican side that even considers or addresses that problem Mr President one of the issues that I have tried to focus on in the midst of this recession is our foreclosure crisis Back in December of 2006 when the housing markets were humming along and the bankers and brokers were raking in money the Center for Responsible Lending published a report called Losing Ground That report in December of 2006 estimated that nearly 2 million homes would be lost to foreclosure in the coming years due largely to shoddy subprime mortgages Here is what the Mortgage Bankers Association told the Washington Post when they heard of this study It was authored by the Center for Responsible Lending The report is wildly pessimistic because most homeowners have prime loans and are not at financial risk That is what a senior economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association said in December of 2006 He went on to say The subprime market is a small part of the overall market Lending industry officials have said that regulatory action could injure the subprime market When he speaks of regulatory action he means regulating these subprime markets On the floor of the Senate I was involved in a debate with a Senator from Texas named Phil Gramm I offered an amendment to a bankruptcy bill which Senator Grassley and I worked on which said If you are guilty of predatory lending you will be precluded in bankruptcy from pursuing your claim That was debated on the Senate floor and debating on the other side against my amendment was Senator Phil Gramm of Texas who said on the floor of the Senate If the Durbin amendment passes it will destroy the subprime mortgage market Well my amendment failed by one vote and the subprime mortgage market continued until it collapsed just a couple of years ago I wish I had had another vote for my amendment At the time this debate took place in December of 2006 about 25 percent of home loans were subprime So the mortgage bankers unfortunately misled the public about the state of the market at the time to wave away warnings about any crisis that might be following and we all know what that has meant to this country I go back to that episode now because 3 years later in 2009 we have had more than 2 million foreclosures something the Mortgage Bankers Association said wouldnt happen In fact the Mortgage Bankers Association has recently announced that in the third quarter of this year nearly one in seven families paying mortgages in this country were either behind on their payments or already in foreclosureone out of seven people holding mortgages today It is hard to imagine That is the highest it has ever been The statement from the Mortgage Bankers Association said Despite the recession ending in midsummer the decline in mortgage performance continues Three years ago the rosy scenario they painted has now morphed into a much more serious situation which they cannot ignore I have been talking about this foreclosure crisis since early in 2007 I stand here with some regret and say it is getting worse In Illinois foreclosure filings in the sixcounty region around Chicago went up 67 percent in the last quarter This isnt just a problem for the city of Chicago New filings in Cook County mainly suburban areas were down 46 percent last quarter The problem unfortunately has migrated to the suburbs All of the socalled collar counties around Chicago have experienced massive increases in foreclosure activity Kane County a nearin county to the city of Chicago saw foreclosure filings increase 97 percent in the last quarter over a comparable period last year I know the administration is working on this The Home Affordable Modification Program is helping some families I know Treasury has stepped up naming and shaming and hoping that it will provide more data for the public on which banks are actually trying Some arenot much but some are Many are not trying at all to renegotiate mortgages for people facing foreclosure But no matter how much the Treasury Department leans on these bankers the big banks that service most of these troubled mortgages have simply not stepped up to the plate Treasury reported yesterday that 33 million families are eligible for the Home Affordable Modification Program Those are the families who are at least 2 months behind on their mortgages and in serious risk of being thrown out in the street How many families based on this 33 million families eligible for this program have been able to get a bank to commit to a permanent loan modification that will keep them in their homes There were 31000 out of 33 million less than onetenth of 1 percent of the families in trouble have been able to work out a permanent solution with their bankers That is disgraceful The big banks that created this mess continue to stand in the way of cleaning it up They are making billions of dollars while foreclosing on millions of American families Shaming the banks with speeches on the floor of the Senate isnt going to work We have learned the hard way that many banks are beyond embarrassment You cant embarrass bankers who take billions of taxpayer dollars to stay solvent and to overcome their bad banking policies then turn around and pay millions out in bonuses to the officers of the same banks You cant publicly shame bankers into doing something when they simply dont care But lets be clear Congress hasnt done its part either We have not done enough to make these banks help the American people who need some help I will continue to come to the floor to remind my colleagues that we must address this crisis far more aggressively than we have and I will continue to look for ways to help One last statistic The Wall Street Journal ran a frontpage story recently highlighting that one in four homeowners who are paying a mortgage today owes more on their mortgage than their house is worth One in four homeowners is making house payments on a home that is now underwater If you owe more than your house is worth and have no extra cash lying around you are really vulnerable If there is a sickness in your family a health care emergency a job loss you could lose your home If you are underwater you are likely to stay there The 107 million families who find their mortgages are higher than the value of their homes are at serious risk of foreclosure Over 400000 of those families are at risk in my home State of Illinois JPMorgan Chase estimates that home prices wont hit bottom until next year so it is going to get worse before it gets better So do we stand idly by and watch thiswatch people lose their lifes savings and their homes watch these boardedup homes spring up across our neighborhoods around towns large and small across America and shake our heads and say it is inevitable We dont have to What we have to do is lean on these banks legally with new laws that put pressure on them to make a difference Dont appeal to their better nature We have tried that and it didnt work We have to use the law We have to stand up for this economy and putting it back on its feet and we have to make the point of saying to these bankers that they have to negotiate these mortgages We need to do our part in the Senate As we focus on health care and jobs and the state of the economy lets not lose sight of this foreclosure crisis that is devastating neighborhoods across the country The economy will struggle to fully recover until more families are confident enough in their homes that they are willing to go out and go shopping again We must do more Mr President I yield the floor Here is what I understood happened I know Senator Dodd came to the HELP Committee with a base bill to start with but it is my understanding in the process 100 Republican amendments were accepted on that bill If I am mistaken I know the Senator will correct me but President it is my understanding that we have gone over the original allocation of time and Senator MCCain is coming to the floor We will of course offer to the minority side whatever extra time we will use so that there will be a like amount available to them and I will make every effort to shorten my remarks The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The majority has not exceeded its time There is 12 minutes remaining on the clock But whatever we promised the minority side they will receive like treatment on whatever time we use President yesterday the majority leader propounded a unanimous consent request to have four votes with respect to the health care bill The Republican leader objected to the consent since he indicated they had just received a copy of Senator Lautenbergs sidebyside amendment to the Dorgan amendment and so they needed time to review the amendment Therefore I now ask unanimous consent that following the period of morning business today the Senate resume consideration of HR 3590 for the purpose of considering the pending Crapo amendment to commit and the Dorgan amendment No 2793 as modified that Senator Baucus be recognized to call up a sidebyside amendment to the Crapo motion that once that amendment has been reported by number Senator Lautenberg be recognized to call up his sidebyside amendment to the Dorgan amendment as modified that prior to each of the votes specified in the agreement there be 5 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form that upon the use or yielding back of the time the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Lautenberg amendment that upon disposition of the Lautenberg amendment the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the Dorgan amendment that upon disposition of that amendment the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Baucus amendment and that upon disposition of that amendment the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Crapo motion to commit that no other amendments be in order during the pendency of this agreement and that the above referenced amendments and motion to commit be subject to an affirmative 60vote threshold that if they achieve that threshold they then be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table if they do not achieve that threshold they then be withdrawn The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Is there objection President this is the second time we have offered to call amendments for a vote and the complaint from the other side is you are not calling amendments for a vote How many times do we have to ask for permission to call amendments for a vote run into objections from the Republican side and then hear the speech Why arent we voting on amendments I am certain that in the vast expansion of time and space we can work out something fair in terms of the number of amendments on both sides In fact maybe the next round will have more Republican amendments than Democratic amendments I dont know how many Republican amendments or Democratic amendments we have voted on so far We can get an official tally but that really seems like a very minor element to stop the debate on health carebecause we need to have an equal number of amendments Cant grownups work things out like this and with an understanding that we will resolve them If we cant then for goodness sake dont subject us to these arguments on the Senate floor that we are not calling amendments for a vote We have just tried 2 days in a row and the Republicans once again have stopped us with objections That is a fact I would implore the leadershipnot my friend from Wyoming I know he is doing what he is instructed to do by the leadersfor goodness sake lets break this logjam Lets not at the end of the day say well we stopped debating this bill when we should have been debating it when we have offered 2 days in a row in good faith to have actual amendments offered and debated I would also say Mr President this is the bill we are considering HR 3590 when we return to it This is the health care reform bill and this is a bill which has been the product of a lot of work A lot of work has gone into it both in the House and in the Senate In the Senate two different committees met literally for months writing this bill and they should take that time because this is the most significant and historic and comprehensive bill I have ever considered in my time in Congressmore than 25 years This bill affects every person in Americaevery person in the gallery everyone watching us on CSPAN every person in America It addresses an issue that every American is concerned aboutthe future of health care how we are going to make it affordable At a time when fewer businesses offer the protection of health insurance at a time when individuals find themselves unable to buy health insurance that is good and that they can afford at a time when health insurance companies are turning down people right and left for virtually any excuse related to preexisting conditions we cannot continue along this road Those who are fighting change those who are resisting reform are basically standing by a broken system There are many elements in American health care that are the best in the world but the basic health care system in America is fundamentally flawed This is the only civilized Nation on Earth where you can die for lack of health insuranceliterally die Mr President 45000 people a year die because they do not have the health insurance they need to bring them to the doctor they need at a critical moment in life They do not have the health insurance they need to afford the surgical procedure they need to avoid a deadly disease If a person has a 5000 deductible on their health insurance and a doctor tells themas a man who wrote me from Illinois saidyou should have a colonoscopy sir there is an indication you could have a problem that could develop into colon cancer and it could be fatal The man says How much is the colonoscopy Well it is 3000 out of pocket The man says I cant afford it I just cant pay for it So he doesnt get the colonoscopy and bad things can occur That happens in America but it doesnt happen in any other civilized country It is true in some systems he may have had to wait an extra week or a month but he gets the care he needs He doesnt die for lack of health insurance That is what is going on in America Almost 50 million Americans without health insurance todayalmost 50 million in this great and prosperous Nationwent to bed last night without the peace of mind of the coverage of health insurance This bill addresses that At the end of the day 94 percent of the people living in America will be able to sleep at night knowing they have a decent health insurance plan That is an amazing step forward That is a step consistent with the establishment of Social Security which finally took the worry away from seniors and their families about what would happen to grandma and grandpa when they stopped working I remember those days There was a time when grandma and grandpa retired and moved in with their kids Remember that era I do It happened in our family and they didnt have any choice They had to because they had modest jobs and not a lot of savings and they put it on their kids to find that spare bedroom or let them sleep in basement that was made over so that they would have a comfortable and safe place to be Social Security changed that for most American families This bill will change health care for most American families The same thing is true with Medicare The critics of Medicareand they have been legion on the floor of the Senateignore the obvious 45 million Americans will have peace of mind to know that they can get affordable health care once they reach the age of 65 They would not lose their life savings They will get a good doctor a good hospital and a good outcome Isnt that what America is all about Isnt that why we are supposed to be here Why dont we have more support The Republican side of the aisle only comes to say what is wrong with the idea of health care Steven Pearlstein in this mornings Washington Postwhich I hope some of my Republican colleagues will readtalks about a lost opportunity which the Republicans have We have invited the Republicans from day one to be part of the conversation about health care reform Senator Enzi of Wyoming is one who assiduously gave every effort spent 61 days trying to reach a bipartisan agreement It failed but at least he tried I commend him for trying Too many others on the other side didnt try But Steven Pearlstein writes One can only imagine how Republicans could have reshaped healthreform legislation in the Senate Without question they could have won more deficitreducing cost savings in the Medicare program by setting limits on spending growth and reforming the way health care is organized provided and paid for And they could have begun to realize their goal of consumerdriven health care by insisting that the new insurance exchanges offer at least one plan built around individual health savings accounts and catastrophic coverage Pearlstein goes on to talk about the possibilities He says They could have taken a page from John MCCains platform and insisted on replacing the current tax exclusion of healthcare benefits with a flat tax credit that would be more progressive and put downward pressure on insurance premiums I am not guaranteeing that any of those proposals would have been in but they all could have been in if we had a dialog Instead of a dialog we have a shouting match one side of the aisle shouting at the other side of the aisle It is exactly the stereotype of Washington which America has come to hate America wants us to solve problems not get into these you know furflying debates where we see who can get the rhetorical better of the other They want us to solve problems but unfortunately we are still waiting for the first Republican to cross the aisle on the passage of this bill and work with us The door is still open The invitation is still there The idea of doing nothing is unacceptable and that should be the message The fact is there is no comprehensive Republican health care reform billperiod Senators come to the floor such as Senator Coburn and say I have some good ideas I bet he does I may even subscribe to them But his ideas have not gone through the rigor this bill has gone through This bill was sent to the Congressional Budget Office and scored asking the basic questions No 1 will it add to the deficit They came back and told us No the Democratic health care reform bill will in fact save money 130 billion in 10 years 650 billion in the second 10 years We asked them Is it going to insure more Americans They came back and said Yes 94 percent will be insured when this is over That same rigor has not been applied to the Republican ideas because it is hard it is tough and it takes time I commend them for their thoughtful ideas but to say they have something they can match against this bill comprehensive reformjust go to the Republican Senate Web site and look for the Republican comprehensive reform bill Do you know what you will find You will find the Democratic bill That is all they can talk about They dont have a comprehensive health care reform bill But we are not going to quit America we cannot go home for Christmas until we get this job done After we have been here 12 straight days debating we kind of get into a trancelike catatonic state where we cant remember what our last speech was about and we go to sleep at night thinking about what we might have said on the floor or what we are going to say tomorrow But the fact is we have to stay and do our job not just in passing health care reform but doing something significant to help the unemployed and deal with jobs and the economy before we leave here to try to enjoy Christmas or what is left of it or the holiday season with our families This is a job that has to be done I am sorry we have reached a point where the Republicans have not been actively involved in creating this bill We tried for the longest time In the HELP Committee where Senator Enzi serves as the ranking Republican more than 100 Republican amendments were accepted as part of this debate and still not one single Republican Senator would vote for the bill in that committee So far the scorecard on Republican participation in health care reform debate is a lot of speeches a lot of press releases a lot of charts on the floor but only two votesone from a Republican Congressman in Louisiana for the House bill one from Senator Snowe of Maine for the Senate Finance version of this bill The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The time of the majority has expired I urge my colleagues to join us in a cooperative effort to try to come up with something more positive than just our lonely speeches on the floor The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The time of the Senator has expired The Senator from Arizona is recognized President I ask unanimous consent morning business be closed I wish to make sure Senator MCCain has time First those who are watching this is perilously close to a debate on the floor of the Senate which rarely occurs in the worlds most deliberative body where Senators with opposing views actually in a respectful way have an exchange I thank the Senator Will the Senator yield for a question Mr DeMINT No I wont It reveals to you the true motives of the majority If we look at this bill and this eventual health care bill if we ever have time to see it before they try to pass itwe are beginning to see a real glimpse a true picture of where this Democratic majority is going Finally this bill increases funding for title X family planning services of which Planned Parenthood is the largest recipient Planned Parenthood is the Nations largest provider of abortions Increasingly they are what we call directed abortions When people come to Planned Parenthood and look for advice on family planning they are more often than not encouraged and pushed toward abortion All around this bill you see what is going on It is a major change in policynot to make abortion available but to make Americans pay for it and to promote it I along with 34 of my colleagues in the Senate signed and sent a letter to the majority leader regarding the troubling antilife policies in this omnibus bill Collectively we vowed to speak out to protect the longstanding Federal funding limitations on abortiona belief that has enjoyed broad bipartisan support for many years For this reason as well as a number of other values issues that are irresponsibly addressed in this legislation I support Senator MCCain to raise a point of order against the omnibus under rule XXVIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate I urge my colleagues to do the same I remind my colleagues that a vote against the MCCain point of order is a vote to force American taxpayers to promote and pay for abortions It is plain and simple I am sure there will be a lot of smoke and mirrors after my talk that will try to convince you that is not true But it is in the legislation and it will happen We need to stop it I thank the Chair and yield the floor President I hope the Senator from South Carolina wont leave He would not yield for a question I want to address his remarks and some of them are not accurate I dont want him to feel that I am saying this outside of his presence I ask the Senator from South Carolina while he has a few minutes if he could look in the bill and find the provision in the bill that kills the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program Please present it to me now because it is not there It is not there The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program is a voucher program created more than 5 years ago It was authorized through the Appropriations Committee not through formal authorization As many as 1700 students in DC ended up going to school and getting about 7500 a year to help pay the tuition for their schools The program has diminished in size I will concede thateven though I tried in a debate and negotiations to change that It is down to about 1300 students It is funded in this bill to the tune of 132 million So for the Senator from South Carolina to stand up and say as he did that this program is killed how does he explain the 132 million in the bill Mr DeMINT If the Senator will yield the President has said he is going to end this program Does this bill end it Mr DeMINT I will come to the floor to explain the technical aspects of why it is not Explain all the technical aspects you would like but the fact is that 132 million goes to the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program And the 1300 students currently in the program will be protected and will receive the tuitiona grant of 7500 per studentin the coming year That is a fact To stand there and say otherwise is wrong Mr DeMINT You grandfather it inif the Senator will yield for a question does this bill fund the continuation of the program beyond the 1300 who are already in it Mr DeMINT It kills the program then If they are why Mr DeMINT But the program will not continue What happens is this program next year will be up going through the Senate and the House of Representatives For the Senator from South Carolina to misrepresent the contents of the bill is not fair Secondly this idea of government funding abortion let me say to the Senator from South Carolina here are the basic pillars on this controversial issue in America First the Supreme Court has said abortion is a legal procedure in Roe v Wade Second Congress said through the Hyde amendment that we will spend no Federal funds for abortion except in cases involving the life of the mother rape and incest Third Congress said any providerhospital doctor medical professionalwho in good conscience cannot participate in an abortion procedure will never be compelled to do so This bill doesnt change that at all In the Senators State of South Carolina and in my State of Illinois the leadership of the Statesthe Governor and the legislaturedecide what they will spend their State funds on That is done in States across the United States Seventeen States have decided they will have State funds pay for abortions beyond the Hyde amendment It is their States decision not our decision in DC We in this bill give them the same authority that the State of South Carolina has and the State of Illinois has No Federal funds from the government from Congress can be spent on this exercise or use of funds for abortions beyond the Hyde amendment But if they choose to use their own fundsjust as South Carolina and Illinois make their choicethen they make that decision Many in Congress have a secret yearning to be mayors of the District of Columbia They want to be on the city councilnot just in the Senate They want to make every finite decision for the 500000 or 600000 people who live here Mr DeMINT Will the Senator yield The people who live here in DC are taxpaying citizens They pay their taxes and they vote for President They send their young men and women off to war just like every State in the Union I think they are entitled to some of the basic rights we enjoy in each of our own States I also want to say a word about the needle exchange program I get nervous around needles I dont like to run in to the doctor and say give me another shot So taking an issue like this on is not a lot of fun to start with Why are we talking about needle exchange programs in the District of Columbia For one simple reason The HIVAIDS infection rate in the District of Columbia Washington DC the Nations Capital is the highest in the Nation We are living in a city with the highest incidence of needlerelated HIVAIDS and meningitis and other things that follow A needle exchange program says to those who are addicted Come to a place where they can at least put you in touch with someone who can counsel you and help move you off your addiction and they will give you a clean needle instead of a dirty one I hate it and I wish we didnt need it I dont like it But in States across the Nation they make the decision that this is the humane and thoughtful thing to do to finally bring addicts in before they infect other people and spread this epidemic The doctors are the ones who tell us this works States make the decisions on it I think the District of Columbia facing the highest incidence of infection from HIVAIDS should also make that same decision in terms of the money they spend The provision that came over from the House of Representatives would have limited the distribution of this program to virtually a handful of places in DC We said that DC can make the rules about where the safe places are for these needle exchange programs As I said I hate to even consider the prospect but I cannot blind myself to the reality that we have this high incidence of infection in the District of Columbia and the medical professionals tell us this is working We are bringing addicts in We are bringing them into a safer situation We are counseling some of them beyond their addiction We are saving lives Am I supposed to turn my back on that and say I am sorry it offends me to think of this concept It offends me to think of people dying needlessly and that is why we have this program Let me say a word about the DC Public Schools I did not ask to take this DC appropriations bill on This is not something I ran for in the House of Representatives or the Senate But it is part of my responsibility This is a great city with great problems but there are some shining lights on the horizon and one of them is Michelle Rhee chancellor of the public school system in the District of Columbia Michelle is an amazing story of a young woman attending Cornell University She decided when she graduated to sign up for one of the top employers of college graduates in America today Teach for America She went off and taught in Baltimore She took a hopeless classroom situation and in 2 years turned it around Kids from the neighborhood had test scores nobody dreamed of because of Michelles skill She worked in New York bringing nontraditional teachers into the teaching situation and then was asked to be chancellor here She is working on an overall reform for the DC Public Schools which I endorse It is a reform which will move us toward pay for performance where those teachers who do a good job and improve test scores are rewarded It is a voluntary program for teachers The results are starting to show This week in the District of Columbia they reported math scores that showed dramatic improvements compared to cities around the Nation She has another responsibility while 45000 kids are in the public schools of DC 28000 are enrolled in public but independent charter schools The charter schools have to match the performance of the public schools or improve upon them It is the same for the voucher schools the DC opportunity scholarships The Senator from South Carolina stands before us to say I eliminate the program Where does that 132 million go It goes to the program the DC opportunity scholarships I did change the program I changed the program because I failed initially when I offered amendments Here are some of the changes I made and you be the judge as to whether these are unreasonable changes I said for the voucher schoolshalf of them are Catholic schoolsI said for the voucher schools every teacher in basic core subjects has to have a college degree How about that for a radical idea a teacher with a college degree It is now required It was not before Second the buildings they teach inthese DC voucher schools have to pass the fire safety code Is that a radical idea killing the program If it means closing a school that is dangerous sure I would close that school in a second before I would send my child or grandchild there Third we said if you attend a DC voucher school the students there have to take the same tests as the DC Public Schools so we can compare how you are doing If you take a different test you have different results We are never going to have a true comparison I also added in here at the suggestion of Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee a former Secretary of Education that each of the DC voucher schools either has to be accredited or seeking accreditation I dont think that is radical I dont think it closes a program The final thing I say is the people who administer this program have to actually physically visit the school at least twice a year We had a hearing where the administrator of the program was shown pictures of some of these DC voucher schools and frankly he said We have not been there Maybe once a year we get by It has to be more than that We have to make sure these schools are functioning and operating We are sending millions of Federal dollars into them We expect it at public schools we expect it at charter schools Should we not ask the same of the DC voucher schools I say this at least those in the Archdiocese of Washington agreed to these things and have said For our Catholic schools we are ready to meet these standards and tests My hat is off to them It is a challenge I am sure but it is one I think they will meet I want them to continue to do that I did try to expand this program in one aspect in the course of our negotiations with Senator Collins assistance so siblings would be allowed to attend this program I think it would be helpful We were not successful There are those opposed to this altogether I say the Senator from South Carolina has mischaracterized the DC voucher program He has not fully explained that we have not changed the Hyde amendment which prohibits Federal funds for abortion purposes other than strict narrow categories He went on to say something about the needle exchange program which does not reflect the reality and the gravity of the health crisis facing the District of Columbia This is not a radical bill This is a bill which I think is in the mainstream of America It is a bill consistent with the same laws that apply in his State of South Carolina and my State of Illinois and most other States across the Nation I wish we were not in this paternalistic position in relation to the District of Columbia I would rather this city had home rule had its own Members of Congress could make its own decisions That is my goal I would like to see that happen In the meantime I think we should treat the people who live here fairly give them a chance to deal with their significant problems acknowledge success as we just reported in the public schools and try to help them where we can This is in fact a great city and the capital of a great nation I think the mayor does a good job I reserve the remainder of my time I would say to the Senator from Arizona I went through bankruptcy reform with Senator Grassley and a similar process was followed when the Republicans were in the majority He produced the baseline bill and I made some modifications and ultimately at one point in time we agreed on a bill came up with a common bill The starting point is just that a starting point But I say to the Senator from Arizona look at what happened to the issue of public option I believe in public option passionately I believe it is essential for the future of health care reform for competition for private health insurance companies to give consumers a choice to make sure we have one lowcost alternative at least in every market Yet at the end of the day I did not get what I wanted and what is being proposed now at the Congressional Budget Office is not my version of public option We ended up bending toward some of the more moderate and conservative members of the Democratic caucus and toward the Republican point of view I dont know of a single Republican who came out for public option Maybe I am forgetting one At the end of the day the point I am making to the Senator is there was an effort at flexibility and an effort at change to try to find some common ground Unfortunately the ground we are plowing has only 60 Democratic votes It could have been much different It could still be much different But I add Senator Snowe has shown I believe extraordinary courage in voting for this bill in the Senate Finance Committee and made it clear she could not support the public option We are hoping at the end of the day she will consider voting for health care reform That was part of the calculation I understand your point of view but I would sayyou are right But we were moving toward our 60 votes but it would be a great outcome if we end up with a bill that brings some Republicans on board and it was clear we couldnt achieve that if we kept the public option in There are other elements here We are going to have a real profound difference when it comes to the issue of medical malpractice and how to approach it But I think even on that issue we could have worked toward some common ground and I hope someday we still can I would say to the Senator from Arizona I am in the dark almost as much as he is and I am in the leadership The reason is because the Congressional Budget Office which scores the managers amendment the socalled compromise has told us once you publicly start debating it we will publicly release it We want to basically see whether it works whether it works to continue to reduce the deficit whether it works to continue to reduce the growth in health care costs We had a caucus after this was submitted to the Congressional Budget Office where Senator Reid and other Senators who were involved in it basically stood and said We are sorry we cant tell you in detail what was involved But you will learn everyone will learn it will be as public information as this bill currently is on the Internet But the Congressional Budget Office has tied our hands at this point putting it forward Basically what I know is what you know having read press accounts of what may be included Same time same place tomorrow I think the Senator is correct saying most of us know the fundamentals but we do not know the important details behind this What I am saying is this is not the choice of the majority leader It is the choice of the Congressional Budget Office We may find that something that was sent over there doesnt work at all doesnt fly They may say this is not going to work start over So we have to reserve the right to do that and I think that is why we are waiting for the Congressional Budget Office scoring as they call it to make sure it hits the levels we want in terms of deficit reduction and reducing the cost of health care It is frustrating on your side It is frustrating here But I am hoping in a matter of hours maybe days we will receive the CBO report I would like to ask the Senator from Arizona if he wouldnt mind responding to me on this Does the Senator believe the current health care system in America is sustainable as we know it in terms of affordability for individuals and businesses Is the Senator concerned that more and more people do not have the protection of health insurance fewer businesses offer that protection The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The 10minute time period has expired Is the Senator concerned as well with the fact that we have 50 million Americans without health insurance and the number is growing that in many of the insurance markets across America there is no competition one or two takeitorleaveit situations Does that lead him to conclude we cannot stay with the current system but have to make some fundamental changes and reforms First the CBO tells us this bill will make Medicare live 5 years more This bill will breathe into Medicare extended life of 5 additional years Second I have heard a lot of negative comments about governmentsponsored health care I ask the Senator from Arizona is he in favor of eliminating the Medicare Program the veterans care program the Medicaid Program the CHIP program to provide health insurance for children all basically governmentadministered programs Does he believe there is something fundamentally wrong with those programs that they should be jettisoned and turned over to the private sector The second question does the Senator from Arizona want to justify why Medicare Advantage offered by private health insurance companies costs 14 percent more than the government plan being offered and we are literally subsidizing private health insurance companies to the tune of billions of dollars each year so they can make more profits at the expense of Medicare If I may respond why is Medicare facing insolvency Why is it going broke Why are the other systems facing it Because the increase in cost in health care each year outstrips inflation There is no way to keep up with it unless we start bending the cost curve We face that reality unless we deal with the fundamentals of how to have more efficient quality health care Going broke is a phenomena not reflective in bad administration of the program but in the reality of health care economics What I am about to say about the expanded Medicare is based solely on press accounts not that I know what was submitted to CBO in detail I do not But the 55 to 64 eligibility for Medicare will be in a separate pool sustained by premiums paid by those going in If they are a high risk pool by nature they will see higher premiums What happens in that pool will not have an impact on Medicare as I understand it It will be a separate pool of those receiving Medicare benefits that they will pay for in actual premiums It wont be at the expense or to the benefit of the Medicare Program itself What I have said is based on press accounts and not my personal knowledge of what was submitted to CBO 
S_IA_GRASSLEY,2009-12-11,1981_2009,0257, President I had a chance to listen to my good friend the Senator from Illinois his remarks about why the bill before the Senate is going to reduce costs and pay down on the national debt Now that is the Senator from Illinois I am the Senator from Iowa But I would like to not refer to my judgment about this bill right now What I would like to refer to is the judgment outlined in a report that was issued today from the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services in the Department of Health and Human Services a professional person who calls it like it is That is his responsibility Remember I am quoting from a report that was just given today about this 2074page bill we have before us and that my friend from Illinois was just speaking very favorably about So I am going to talk about somebody in the executive branch of government under the President of the United States who says this about this reform bill that it will cost more than the status quo The Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services issued a report on Senator Reids bill which shows that health care costs would go up not down under his bill The Chief Actuary warned that the Democrats health care bill would increase health care costs threaten access to care for seniors and force people off their current coverage In other words the administrations own Chief Actuary conclusively demonstrates that the Democrats rhetoric does not match the reality of the bill The cost curve would bend up not down National health expenditures would increase from 16 percent of GDP to 209 percent under the Reid bill The Chief Actuary concluded that the Federal Government and the country would spend 234 billion more under the bill than without it The Chief Actuary also says that the bill jeopardizes access to care for beneficiaries because of the bills severe cuts in Medicare Quoting the Chief Actuary Providers for whom Medicare constitutes a substantive portion of their business could find it difficult to remain profitable and might end their participation in the program possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries Then it speaks about the savings in the bill being unrealistic The Actuary says that many of the Medicare cuts are unrelated to the providers costs of furnishing services to beneficiaries It is therefore doubtful that providers could reduce costs to keep up with the cuts Then the Chief Actuary speaks about new taxes costing consumers 11 billion per year The new taxes in the Reid bill would increase drug and device prices and health insurance premiums for consumers The Actuary estimates this would increase costs on consumers by 11 billion per year beginning in 2011that is 3 years before most benefits kick in Then the Actuary speaks about health care shortages that these health care shortages are plausible and even probable particularly for Medicare and Medicare beneficiaries Because of the increased demand for health care the Actuary says that accesstocare problems again these words plausible and even probable under the Reid bill The access problems will be the worst for seniors on Medicare and lowincome people on Medicaid The Actuary says providers might tend to accept more patients who have private insurance with relatively attractive payment rates and fewer Medicare and Medicaid patients exacerbating existing access problems for the latter group Premiums for the governmentrun plan would actually be higher than under private plans Agreeing with the Congressional Budget Office the Chief Actuary said that because the government plan would not encourage higher value health care and it would attract sicker people premiums for the governmentrun plan would be 4 percent higher than for the private insurers Then there is a point about employers dropping coverage The Chief Actuary concluded that 17 million people will lose their employer sponsored coverage Many smaller employers would be inclined to terminate their existing coverage so their workers could qualify for heavily subsidized coverage through the exchange Then it speaks lastly about the longterm health care part of this bill called the CLASS Act The CLASS Act stands for Community Living Assistance Services and Support CLASS The Chief Actuary has determined that the CLASS Act longterm care insurance program faces a significant risk of failure because the high costs will attract sicker people and lead to low participation Even though premiums would be 240 a month the policy would result in a net Federal cost in the long term I think quoting the Chief Actuary is a very good way to bring attention to the shortcomings that on this side of the aisle we have tried to discuss about the 2074page bill Members on this side of the aisle have shown that the Reid bill will bend the health spending curve the wrong way over the next year and that the Reid bill cuts Medicare by 12 trillion and jeopardizes seniors access to care So again quoting from the Health and Human Services Chief Actuarys analysis confirms the dangerous consequences of the 2074page Reid bill I would like to highlight some of the findings in a more encompassing way than I just did quoting the Chief Actuary First contrary to what Members on the other side of the aisle claim the Chief Actuarys report confirms that the Reid bill bends the cost curve the wrong way According to the HHS Chief Actuary over the next 10 yearsand this chart highlights ittotal national health expenditures under this bill would increase by an estimated total of 234 billion And a good portion of the increase in national health expenditures would be caused by the socalled fees in this bill on medical devices and on prescription drugs and on health insurance premiums Here we have a chart where the Chief Actuary found that fees would be passed through to health consumers in the form of higher drug and device prices and higher insurance premiums This would result in an associated increase of approximately 11 billion per year in overall national health expenditures This refutes claims from the other side that the socalled fees wont be passed on to consumers And this analysis clearly refutes claims from the other side that the Reid bill saves money Next the Chief Actuary also confirms that the Reid bill jeopardizes beneficiary access to care The Chief Actuary tallied up around 493 billion in net Medicare cuts and he raised concerns in particular about two categories of these Medicare cuts First the report warns about the permanent productivity adjustments to annual payment updates These productivity adjustments automatically cut annual Medicare payment updates based on productivity measures for the entire economy not just for that section of health care part of the economy The Chief Actuary confirms that these permanent cuts would threaten access to care Referring to these cuts he wrote that the estimated savings may be unrealistic and possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries It is doubtful that many could improve their own productivity to the end achieved by the economy at large This is a direct quote from the Chief Actuarys report He goes on to say We are not aware of any empirical evidence demonstrating the medical communitys ability to achieve productivity improvements equal to those of the overall economy In other words basically he is saying this If you are going to make a judgment that you are going to cut health care costs and that productivity has to be measured by the entire economy you cant take the entire economy and apply it to a small segment of the economy health careand expect it to be fair and expect that small segment of the economy to be as productive and equal the productivity of the entire US economy You have to listen to these people who are professionals in these areas The Chief Actuary is a professional In fact the Chief Actuarys conclusion is that it would be difficult for providers to even remain profitable over time as Medicare payments fail to keep up with the cost of caring for beneficiaries Referring to this chart ultimately here is the Chief Actuarys conclusion that providers who rely on Medicare might end their participation in Medicare possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries That is right out of the Chief Actuarys report is where that quote comes from He even has numbers to back up these statements His office ran simulations of the effect of these drastic and permanent cuts Here we have the quote Based on the simulations the Chief Actuary found that during the first 10 years 20 percent of Medicare Part A providers would become unprofitable as a result of productivity adjustments This is going to be horrible on rural America where we already have difficult times recruiting doctors and keeping our hospitals open As I said it is difficult to keep up with these productivity adjustments by our providers It is for this reason that the Actuary found that reductions in payment updates based on economywide productivity gains are unlikely to be sustainable on a permanent annual basis That is right out of the report of the Actuary The second category of Medicare cuts the Chief Actuary raises concerns about would be imposed by the new independent Medicare advisory board created in this 2074page bill This new body of unelected officials would have broad authority to make even further cuts in Medicare These additional cuts in Medicare would be driven by arbitrary cost growth targets based on a blend of general economic growth and medical inflation This board would have the authority to impose further automatic Medicare cuts even absent any congressional action The Chief Actuary gives a reality check to this proposal He shows how tall an order the Reid bills target for health care cost growth actually is Again quoting the Actuary Limiting cost growth to a level below medical price inflation would represent an exceedingly difficult challenge He points out in this analysis that Medicare cost growth was below this target in only 4 of the last 25 years Just thinkwhat this 2074page bill is trying to accomplish is something that has been accomplished in only 4 out of the last 25 years The Actuary also points out that the backroom deals that carved out certain types of providers would complicate this boards effort to cut Medicare So to this analysis The necessary savings would have to be achieved primarily through changes affecting physician services Medicare Advantage payments and Part D So providers such as hospitals will escape from this boards cut at the expense of doctors Medicare Advantage plans and higher premiums imposed on beneficiaries for their Medicare drug coverage Part D of Medicare If we survey the Nations seniors I doubt very much they would say that raising their premiums for Medicare drug coverage is what they would call health care reform This board which can cut reimbursements is guaranteed to have to impose these additional Medicare cuts In other words they can do it According to the Chief Actuarys analysis of the Medicare cuts in the Reid bill even though the Medicare cuts already in the Reid bill are quite substantial they wouldthe savings would not be sufficient to meet the growth rate targets This means the board will be required by law to impose even more Medicare cuts in addition to the massive Medicare cuts already in the bill This bill imposes a 212 trillion tab on Americans It kills jobs with taxes and fees that go into effect 4 years before the reforms kick in It kills jobs with an employer mandate It imposes 12 trillion in higher taxes on premiums on medical devices on prescription drugs and more It jeopardizes access to care with massive Medicare cuts It imposes higher costs It raises premiums It bends the growth curve the wrong way in other words up instead of down This is not what people have in mind when they think about health care reform There is another aspect to this bill that I wish to go over I hope the third time is the charm I hope this time the other side of the aisle will understand that the Reid bill increases taxes on middle income families individuals and single parents That is because contrary to the claims made by the other side of the aisle the Reid bill clearly raises taxes on middleincome Americans We have data not from this Senator but as I quoted previously the expertise of the Chief Actuary I want to quote the expertise now of the Joint Committee on Taxation professionals who are blind to politics who judge things and call them like they see them Yesterday I pointed out how the same Joint Committee on Taxation data led my Democratic friends to proclaim that the Reid bill provided a net tax cut to all Americans We have this distribution chart I used previously to show that that net really is not net There is no question that the bill does provide a tax benefit to a group of Americans a relatively small group A much larger group however will see their taxes go up Most if not all in this group will not benefit from the government subsidy for health insurance That is part of this 2074page bill As a result the generous subsidy that is in that bill that is going to a small group of Americans cannot be used by this larger group to offset their increased tax liabilities The other side however wants to spread the large tax benefit that is going to this small group of Americans to everybody in other words all Americans even among those Americans who are not eligible to receive the subsidy and then somehow claim that all Americans are receiving a tax cut How can a person receive a tax cut if they are not receiving some type of tax benefit Yes the data shows that some will receive a benefit but the data also shows that the others will see a tax increase I have highlighted in yellow these various figures individuals and families who will see a tax increase In general these individuals and families are not receiving the subsidy for health insurance This means they have no government benefit to offset their new tax liability The most important point I want to makefor the third timeis that these tax increases fall on individuals making more than 50000 and families making more than 75000 Again I highlighted this group on the Joint Committee on Taxation chart The Joint Committee distributed in this chart three separate tax provisions the highcost plan tax the medical expense deduction limitation and the Medicare payroll tax Among these tax provisions the highcost plan tax seems to be garnering the most attention and also tremendous opposition I dont have to explain who the opponents of this tax increase are Everybody knows In fact yesterday I had representatives of the Iowa Education Association the teachers of Iowa saying they are against that high plan tax because it is going to hurt Iowa teachers So if this provision the highcost plan tax were to drop out of the Reid bill for one reason or anotherand this bill is still being written in secret or at least changes in this 2074page bill are being written in secret so who knows what is going to happen to this highly controversial thingif it is taken out some Members may feel they have successfully shielded the middle class from a tax increase Unfortunately for those Members who may be hopeful of this lesser known tax provisions that are likely to stay in the changes that come through the Democratic health care reform product would still raise taxes on the middle class Again dont take my word for it The Joint Committee on Taxation tells us so Specifically that committee sent a letter to Senator Crapo stating that tax provisions such as the cap on flexible savings accounts the elimination of tax reimbursements for overthecounter medicines and most importantly the individual mandate excise tax penalty will increase taxes on people making less than 250000 That happens to be middleclass individual middleclass families and middleclass single parents I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record that letter There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows Congress of the United States Joint Committee on Taxation Washington DC December 9 2009 Hon Mike Crapo US Senate Washington DC Dear Senator Crapo This letter is in response to your request of December 8 2009 for information regarding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as introduced by Senator Reid In particular you requested that we provide you with information on the provisions in the bill that would increase tax liability for taxpayers with adjusted gross income AGI under 200000 250000 in the case of a joint return In previous correspondence with you we provided a distributional analysis of the bill In estimating the distributional effects of the bill we distributed items that have economic incidence on individuals including some items that do not have statutory incidence We are enclosing a copy of that distributional analysis for reference Included in the distribution table are the following items that would have statutory incidence as well as economic incidence on individuals and are likely to increase tax liabilities for some taxpayers with AGI below 200000 250000 in the case of a joint return 1 Raise the 75 percent AGI floor on medical expenses deduction to 10 percent and 2 Additional 05 percent hospital insurance tax on wages in excess of 200000 250000 joint You asked us to enumerate items that we have not previously distributed and that we believe could affect the tax liability of taxpayers with AGI below 200000 250000 in the case of a joint return Below is a list of the provisions that we have not previously distributed and that have statutory incidence on individuals with some of those individuals likely to have income below your threshold 1 Conform definition of medical expenses for health savings accounts Archer MSAs health flexible spending arrangements and health reimbursement arrangements 2 Increase the penalty for nonqualified health savings account distributions to 20 percent 3 Limit health flexible spending arrangements in cafeteria plans to 2500 4 Impose a fivepercent excise tax on cosmetic surgery and similar procedures and 5 Impose an individual mandate penalty I hope this information is helpful to you If we can be of further assistance in this matter please let me know Sincerely Thomas A Barthold Enclosure GRAPHIC TIFF OMITTED TS11DE09001 GRAPHIC TIFF OMITTED TS11DE09002 In closing let me turn to one more chart the Joint Tax Committee has provided This chart shows the effect on the medical expense deduction limitation This tax increase is just one of the many tax increases likely to stay in the new Democratic proposal On this chart which is for the year 2019 because that is when this bill is fully implemented we see positive dollar figures I have highlighted these dollar figures in yellow For those who may not be able to see I will reiterate that this chart only has positive dollar figures on it But remember as I explained yesterday when we see positive dollar figures from the Joint Committee on Taxation that committee is telling us that taxes for these people are going to go up That means for all of the tax returns listed on this chart taxes will be going up for each And this tax increase the medical expense deduction limitation reaches as low as someone making 10000 a year Maybe some of these lowincome individuals and families who will see a tax increase under this provision will receive a subsidy for health insurance These people may be able to offset this new tax liability But you can bet your bottom dollar that a large portion of the middle income individuals and families are not receiving a subsidy This means that this tax liability highlighted in yellow cannot be offset by the government benefit My Democratic friends cannot escape that fact Even if my friends drop some of the tax provisions in the current Reid bill many tax provisions will most likely remain And those tax provisions will increase taxes on middleclass Americans This not only breaks President Obamas pledge but it will arbitrarily burden middleclass Americans for years to come I yield the floor The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Udall of Colorado The Senator from New Jersey 
S_MT_BAUCUS,2009-12-08,1978_2009; 1978_2009; 1978_2009; 1978_2009; 1978_2009; 1978_2009; 1978_2009; 1978_2009,0602; 0603; 0600; 0601; 0598; 0599; 0604; 0605, At least indirectly it is our understanding that Senator Reid will soon come to the floor to speak Madam President with respect to the last debate lets be clear that the underlying bill keeps the threedecadesold agreement that has implemented the Hyde amendment to separate Federal funds from private funds when it comes to reproductive health care The NelsonHatch amendment is unnecessary It is discriminatory against women Women are the only group of people who are told how to use their own private money That is unfair On another matter with respect to the MCCain motion let me explain a little bit about Medicare Advantage and how it works Essentially the Medicare Advantage Programs are insurance companies They are insurance companies that have their own officers directors their own marketing plans and their own administrative costs and they are concerned about the rate of return on investment for their stockholders These are simple garden variety ordinary insurance companies In this case they are insurance companies that get general revenue from payroll taxes and premiums They are basically insurance companies that give benefits to senior citizens These insurance companies are overpaid There is not much disagreement that they are overpaid How are they paid Well believe it or not these insurance companies Medicare Advantage plansare paid according to the amount Congress sets in statute That is their payment rate what Congress sets in statute The problem is by doing so these preset rates overstate the actual cost of providing care by 30 percent We pay more than it costs to provide care by about 30 percent in many cases These overpayments also clearly promote inefficiencies in Medicare Also these payments have not been proven to increase the quality of care seniors receive In the estimate I saw about half the Medicare Advantage plans have care coordination and half dont Half are no better than ordinary fee forservice plans Because of this broken irrational payment system some plans receive more than 200 per enrollee per month and others receive about 36 per enrollee per month Again the payment rates are set by statute relating to fee for service in the area It is broken It doesnt make sense It causes great dislocations and differences in the payment rates Frankly under this broken system all beneficiaries are not receiving the same care I believe all beneficiaries should be able to have access to the best care not just those who happen to live in States with high payment rates Madam President I ask unanimous consent to continue for an additional 5 minutes Madam President I have said these Medicare Advantage plans are overpaid Nobody disagrees with that They are overpaid The Senator from Oklahoma Mr Coburn when I asked him a few days ago if he thought they were overpaid said Yes they are overpaid The MedPAC advisory board tells us Yes they are overpaid Here is a statement made by Tom Scully former Administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services I think Congress should take some of it away Theres been huge overfunding There are lots of other citations from Wall Street analysts and others in the industry saying clearly the Medicare Advantage plans are overpaid Frankly we in Congress put a statutory provision in law that has caused this overpayment Clearly we should fix it In addition something that is pretty alarming is according to a study I saw only about 14 cents on the dollar of extra payments to Medicare Advantage plans goes to beneficiariesonly 14 centswhich means 86 cents on the dollar goes to the company not to the beneficiaries not to the enrollees but to the companiesthe companies meaning the officers directors administrative costs marketing costs rate of return It is to the company any ordinary garden variety company Therefore it behooves us to find a better way to pay Medicare Advantage companies so it is efficient there is not waste and payments go primarily to enrollees to beneficiaries How do we do that This legislation moves away from the current archaic system which sets statutory amounts in effect Rather we say OK why not have these companies bid Let them compete based on costs in their regions One region of the country is different from another region of the country We are going to say what is fair here to get rid of a lot of waste and overpayments is provide that Medicare Advantage plans can compete in their area based on cost The plan will be paid the average bids that are based on competition in the area We the authors of this bill think that is a far better way of paying for Medicare Advantage Will that reduce payments to beneficiaries Certainly no All guaranteed benefits are guaranteed in this legislation In fact I am going to check up on another statistic I heard somewhere under this legislation there will be an increase of enrolleesnot a decrease an increase of enrollees I am going to track that down because I want to be sure I am accurate I will conclude I want to talk more about this issue later There may be a separate amendment on this subject offered on our side By and large it is wrong to continue a current system that dramatically overpays and where 86 percent of the overpayment goes to the company and only 14 cents goes to the beneficiaries We have to come up with a fair way of paying Medicare Advantage I think a fair way is to have the companies competitively bid based on cost in their areas That way they are going to get reimbursed at a level that is relevant to their area and it is also relative to the cost they incur when they run their plans I will have more to say about that later I yield the floor President I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Nebraska be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes President for the benefit of all Senators I would like to take a moment to lay out todays program It has been more than 212 weeks since the majority leader moved to proceed to the health care reform bill and this is the ninth day of debate The Senate has considered 18 amendments or motions We have conducted 14 rollcall votes Today the Senate will debate the amendment by the Senator from Nebraska Mr Nelson on a womans right to choose At the same time we will debate the motion by Senator MCCain on Medicare Advantage The time between now and the caucus lunches is for debate only The majority will control the first hour of debate this morning the Republicans will control the second hour We are hopeful the Senate will be able to conduct votes on or in relation to the Nelson amendment a sidebyside amendment to the MCCain motion and the MCCain motion sometime this afternoon Thereafter we expect to turn to another Democratic firstdegree amendment which is likely to be the amendment by the Senator from North Dakota Mr Dorgan on drug reimportation and another Republican firstdegree amendment We are working on lining up those amendments I note that the pending MCCain motion is the third such effort by the Republicans to defend the private insurance companies that run the program called Medicare Advantage That is the same socalled Medicare Advantage Program that the nonpartisan MedPAC says is overpaid overpaid by 14 percentcompared with traditional Medicare which does the same thing That is the same socalled Medicare Advantage Program whose overpayments add 90 to the Medicare premiums of a typical retired couple even though that couple gets nothing in exchange That is the same socalled Medicare Advantage Program that has been the major source of strong profits for the private insurance companies that receive those overpayments And that is the same socalled Medicare Advantage Program that helps those private insurance companies to pay their CEOs 8 million a year 9 million a year and in one instance more than 20 million a year in compensation So that is the same socalled Medicare Advantage Program that in our view needs a healthy dose of competition That is all our bill would do Our bill would move to competitive bidding in the private insurance Medicare market It is high time we did so This morning we are going to have a colloquy among many new Senators the group of Senators who were just elected last year which is a very active group I have met with them many times They are very thoughtful very active and they have a lot to say The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Connecticut is recognized Madam President may I ask unanimous consent to speak for a couple of minutes to comment on the freshman package It will just take a few minutes Madam President I join my good friend from Connecticut in thankingI dont know if calling them freshmen would be wise because our colleagues act as though they have been here for years and know the subject extremely well Delivery system reform has always been something I have been pushing for and I am happy to see it is part of your package and also with additional emphasis on rural areas and Indian reservations We clearly need more of that and more transparency I firmly believe that will help us get costs down and get quality of care up Your work on the independent Medicare advisory board is great too To be honest these are all the next steps in ideas that are pretty much in the bill but they are the proper next steps and the next steps I firmly believe should be taken So I compliment you and thank you very much and I thank my friend from Arizona for allowing me this time President the MCCain motion to commit on Medicare Advantage would keep overpayments in the Medicare Advantage program even though the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission recommends that they be eliminated The MCCain motion to commit is a tax on all seniors It would maintain the overpayments to private insurers and require beneficiaries to pay higher Part B premiums The average couple pays 90 per year just so insurers can reap greater profits under Medicare The MCCain amendment is a raid on the Medicare trust fund MA overpayments take 18 months off the life of the Part A trust fund And according to MedPAC there is no evidence of greater quality of care In fact MedPAC told Congress this year that only some MA plans are of high quality MedPAC finds that only half of beneficiaries nationwide have access to a plan that Medicare rates above average on overall plan quality The more than 45 million seniors with Medicare deserve better They do not deserve to subsidize high profits of private insurers And the more than 11 million Medicare beneficiaries who choose to enroll in private plans also deserve better They deserve plans that coordinate care Most plans today do not They deserve plans that are of high quality Many plans today do not If Senators want to help beneficiaries they will vote to eliminate overpayments under Medicare Advantage And they should vote against the MCCain motion President I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Armed Services be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on December 8 2009 at 130 pm President I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Environment and Public Works be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on December 8 2009 at 10 am in room 406 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building President I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Foreign Relations be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on December 8 2009 at 215 pm President I ask unanimous consent that the Select Committee on Intelligence be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on December 8 2009 at 230 pm President I ask unanimous consent that the Subcommittee on Energy be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate in order to conduct a hearing on December 8 at 230 pm in room SD366 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building 
S_CA_FEINSTEIN,2009-12-08,1992_2009; 1992_2009; 1992_2009,0238; 0239; 0240, President simply put I believe this amendment would be a harsh and unnecessary step back in health coverage for American women What this amendment would do as I read it is to prohibit any health insurance plan that accepts a single government subsidy or dollar from providing coverage for any abortion no matter how necessary that procedure might be for a womans health even if she pays for the coverage herself The proponents of this amendment say their sole aim is to block government funds from being used to cover abortion but the underlying bill already does that In the bill before us health plans that opt to cover abortion servicesin cases other than rape incest or when the life of the mother is at stakemust segregate the premium dollars they receive to ensure that only private dollars and not government money is used They argue that segregating funds means nothingyou heard that and that money is fungible However this method of separating funds for separate uses is used in many other areas and there is ample precedent for the provision For example charitable choice programs allow agencies that promote religion to receive Federal funds as long as these funds are segregated from religious activities We all know that We see it in program after program If these organizations can successfully segregate their sources of funding surely health insurance plans can do the same Additionally the Secretary of Health and Human Services must certify that the plan does not use any Federal funding for abortion coverage based on accounting standards created by the GAO This amendment would place an unprecedented restriction on a womans right to use her own money to purchase health care coverage that would cover abortions Let me give my colleagues one example Recently my staff met with a bright young married attorney who works for the Federal Government She and her husband desperately wanted to start a family and were overjoyed to learn she was pregnant Subsequently she learned the baby she was carrying had anencephaly a birth defect whereby the majority of the brain does not develop She was told the baby could not survive outside of the womb She ended the pregnancy but received a bill of nearly 9000 Because she is employed by the Federal Government her insurance policy would not cover the procedure Her physician argued that continuing the pregnancy could have resulted in dysfunctional labor and postpartum hemorrhage which can increase the risk for the mother The physician also warned that the complications could be life threatening However OMB found that this circumstance did not meet the narrow exception in which a womans life not her health is in danger The patient was told The fetal anomaly presented no medical danger to you despite the admonitions of her physician The best she could do was to negotiate down the cost to 5000 Now this story without question is tragic A very muchwanted pregnancy could not be continued and on top of this loss the family was left with a substantial unpaid medical bill Health insurance is designed to protect patients from incurring catastrophic bills following a catastrophic medical event But if this amendment passes insured women would lose any coverage included in the underlying bill even if she pays for it herself Why would this body want to do that I cant support that A womans pregnancy may also exacerbate a health condition that was previously under control or a woman may receive a new diagnosis in the middle of her pregnancy It happens If this amendment passes women in these circumstances would also learn that their insurance does not cover an abortion In some cases it may be unclear whether the womans health problem meets the strict definition of life endangerment The National Abortion Federation has compiled calls they receive on their hotline which are available to women who need assistance obtaining abortion care Let me give you a few examples Molly was having kidney problems and was in a great deal of pain She couldnt go to work She couldnt provide for her two children When she became pregnant she made the decision to terminate the pregnancy in order to have her kidney removed to begin her recovery She knew carrying the pregnancy would create additional health problems and would leave her unable to provide for her family Jamie already had severe health problems when she learned she was pregnant She was a severe diabetic and her low blood sugar levels caused her to suffer from seizures She was unable to continue her pregnancy but had difficulty affording the procedure Another was suffering from a serious liver illness when she became pregnant Doctors were unsure of the cause but she was in a great deal of pain She already had two children She could not care for them because of this pain The tests and medications she needed to address her medical condition were incompatible with pregnancy None of these women experienced immediate threats to their lives so under this amendment their circumstances would not meet the narrow exceptions permitted for abortion coverage This is a problem How can one say we are going to provide insurance but we dont like one aspect of it We dont want the government to pay for it OK OK But the woman herself cant pay for it That is the extra step that this legislation takes To this day it is still legal to have an abortion Women in this situation dont buy insurance for abortion but they buy a policy that may cover them married women should something happen in a pregnancy in the third trimester If they find a baby is without a brain she can have an abortion and it is covered One of the problems with this whole debate is everybody sees something through their own lens They dont see the grief and trouble and morbidity that is out there and the circumstances that drive a woman to decidemarriedshe has to terminate her pregnancy for very good medical reasons Nobody considers that This is all ideologic and it really deeply bothers me So I can only tell my colleagues I very much hope this amendment goes down Thank you very much Mr President I yield the floor The motion to lay on the table was agreed to

Patriots fans I would like to ask the Senator from New Hampshire if he would yield if he is familiar with Doug Elmendorf and the Congressional Budget Office and the letter of November 18 2009 to the majority leader Harry Reid in relation to the deficit impact of the CLASS Act So good at it that they are one of the most profitable sectors in the American economy and virtually everybody knows somebody they work with or someone in their family who has had a bad experience with a health insurance company in America That is the reality we are facing today If the chair would advise me when I have used that time I found it interesting as I am sure the Senator from Montana has to listen to all of the Republican Senators who have come to the floor to defend Medicare I am sure the Senator from Montana has the same memory I dothat when it was created it was created by the Democratic side of the aisle with the general opposition of the Republican side of the aisle They said it was socialized medicine too much government and it would fail Now they are coming riding to the rescue of Medicare We have a right to be skeptical about the arguments they are making Imagining these Republican Senators defending Medicare is trying to imagine a fish riding a bicycle I cannot put it in my mind But they are doing it The Senator who sponsored this motion to commit Senator MCCain just a year ago in the course of his Presidential campaign called for eliminating 13 trillion in spending from Medicare and Medicaid Now he comes to the floor and says this bill which would reduce costs in Medicare by less than half of that amount over a 10 year period of time is irresponsible and the death knell of Medicare What is the real story The real story is the Republican side of the aisle is defending the private health insurance companiescompanies making generous profits from Medicare Advantage This is a program offered by private health insurance companies to replace governmentrun Medicare It turned out in many instances to have failed miserably It costs more money because these private health insurance companies are taking profits out of the Medicare Advantage Program So they have pleaded with the other side of the aisle to come to their rescue They have sent in their best troops on the other side of the aisle headed by the senior Senator from Arizona who has said the first thing I will do is to protect these private health insurance companies and their rights to overcharge seniors in Medicare for Medicare Advantage He talks about the people now receiving Medicare Advantage who may be disadvantaged and see a different policy in the future What the Senator from Arizona and others dont dwell on is that everybody under Medicare today pays 90 a year more into Medicare to subsidize the private health insurance companies that offer Medicare Advantage This is a taxa taxwhich the Senator from Arizona is trying to preserve It is a tax on Medicare recipients The Senator from Arizona was right a year ago We can take an honest look at Medicare and Medicaid and take money out of the system without disadvantage to the people involved I want to say to the Senator from Arizona and others that once we have dispatched his motion to commit he will have a chance to vote for Senator Michael Bennets amendment It could not be clearer It has two parts It saysrepeating what this bill says it says unequivocally No provision in this Senate bill can reduce any Medicare benefit guaranteed by statute Next paragraph Savings in Medicare from the bill will go to extend the life of the Medicare trust fund lower part B premiums or cost sharing expands benefits improves access to providers We know and the seniors across America know that left unattended and uncared for Medicare may go broke in just a matter of 7 or 8 years This bill before us will extend the life of Medicare for at least 5 years It will put Medicare on sound footing which every senior and their families want to have That is why AARP the largest organization of senior citizens across America has urged Members of the Senate in both parties to oppose the MCCain motion to commit That is why I stand today with the Senator who is chairman of the Finance Committee and say to my Republican friends with their newfound love affair with Medicare that they should reject the 60 Plus organization this wise counsel they turned to that came up with the idea of privatizing Social Security How would you like to have had all your Social Security money in the stock market over the last 2 years Boy there is a great idea Stick with this 60 Plus group if you like the notion of privatizing Social Security Stick with AARP if you want Medicare to be strong on sound financial footing I yield the floor I would just say it is unfortunate the Senator from New Hampshire has not seen this letter because if he had had an opportunityand it is impossible to read everythingif he had had an opportunity to read that letter I do not think he would have made the speeches he just made on the floor about the CLASS Act because the Congressional Budget Office tells us that in the first 10 years the CLASS Act will reduce the Federal budget deficit by 725 billion in the second 10 years by a substantial amount though somewhat less than 725 billion and in the third 10 years30 years outit is anticipated it will add to the deficit but in the words of the letter from the Congressional Budget Office by a very small amount over that next decade President does the Senator yield the floor President I ask unanimous consent that the next amendment in order be one offered by Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island which is at the desk that the other matter in order during todays session be a Hatch motion to commit regarding Medicare Advantage that no other amendments or motions to commit be in order during todays session and that the time in sequence following this unanimous consent requestI do not want to disadvantage the Senator from New Hampshire but if it is our turn on this side of the aisle I would ask that Senator Whitehouse first be recognized for the purpose of calling up his amendment and then I be recognized next for no more than 15 minutes and at that point it is my understanding Senator Hatch has asked for the floor for 1 hour on his motion If there are any other requests I would be glad to add them to the unanimous consent request at this point I am going to finish this as soon as I have gone through my preliminary work here I also ask unanimous consent that the time until 8 pm this evening be equally divided and controlled between Senators Whitehouse and Hatch or their designees that it be in order during this time for Members to engage in colloquies as long as those Members entering into the colloquy remain on the floor President I have listened carefully to the profound and eloquent statements from my friend and colleague from New Hampshire Senator Judd Gregg He has frequently invoked the name of the Ponzi family though I am not personally familiar with them I believe they have had some skeletons in their closet by virtue of the references that have been made But I will tell him that what he said about the CLASS Act is inaccurate I know that Senator I see is leaving the floor I hope he does not miss out on this conversation But Reclaiming the floor I would just say if I understand what the Senator said he is concerned that in the year 2040 this program may not work as effectively as we had hoped it would work I trust in the wisdom of future Members of the Senate and the House if that is necessary to modify the program But it certainly is worthwhile for us to at least reflect on what this program is It is a voluntary selffunded insurance fund for longterm care for American citizens It was one of the visions of Senator Kennedy as part of health care reform understanding we are living longer and many times need help in our late years in life and it can be expensive and deplete a familys savings Senator Kennedy said Lets try to put together a voluntary program where you can pay in and have in fact longterm care insurance available to you if you need it The fact that this program is virtually solvent for 30 straight years is an indication of the wisdom of that idea and the way it is planned I might add one other thing We just finished a motion to commit on the floor relative to Medicare and many of us argued that the bill before us the bill that represents health care reform in this debate protects Medicare and guarantees the basic benefits of Medicare Those on the other side of the aisle protested and said No it does not Well then Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado offered an amendment which said pointblank and clearly nothing in this bill will in any way diminish guaranteed Medicare benefits and a surplus generated here will be to give a longer life to the existing Medicare Program The Bennet of Colorado amendment passed 100 to nothing so not only does the bill originally protect Medicare the Bennet amendment repeated that and all the Republicans voted for it Yet they continue to come to the floor and say We do not believe what we voted for We believe this bill is going to hurt Medicare The same thing is true with the CLASS Act because Senator Whitehouse who was on the floor momentarily came forward and said I will put it in writing We are going to put it in writing that the surplus in the CLASS Act program cannot be used for other purposes and has to be saved and used for the purposes stated here for longterm care insurance I think the Whitehouse amendment is likely to get another 100 votes So every time we address a concern from the Republican side of the aisle and say the bill addresses that concern or a separate amendment addresses that concern they protest It is not enough We need more I think they protest too much I would also say I am troubled today as I have been for several weeks by the position taken from the Republican side of the aisle about health care reform For about 13 or 14 days this bill in its entirety has been available to the American people You can find it by Googling Senate Democrats and it will direct you to our Web site and you can click on this bill HR 3590 and read it page after pageall 2074 pages of it That is the way it should be There was a lot of angst and worry last August in townhall meetings Well are you going to get this bill sneaked by us Are we going to get a chance to read it Everybody has a chance to read it But then I would recommend to those who are searching the Internet to read health care reform bills that if you want to find the Republican health care reform bill look for Senate Republicans and go to their Web site and you will be able to click on health care reform bill and you will find the Democratic health care reform bill because unfortunately there is no Republican health care reform bill They have not offered one They have had a year to prepare it They have had plenty of ideas they have expressed on the floor They have been critical of our efforts They have offered literally hundreds of amendments in committee and yet they cannot come up with a bill It leads you to conclude this is not an easy task It is not easy at all It certainly is not easy to produce a bill such as this one the Democratic bill which generates over the first 10 years a 130 billion Federal surplus in our Treasury This bill adds more in terms of surplus and deficit reduction than any bill in the history of the Senate In the second 10 years the Congressional Budget Office says there will be another 650 billion in savings on our deficit So for those who argue if we pass this bill we are going deeper in debt they ignore the Congressional Budget Office that referee that takes a look at all the bills and tells us that over the span of 20 years we are going to reduce our deficit by some 700 billion or 800 billion just by virtue of this bill Republicans have been unable to produce a bill that reduces the deficit when it comes to health care by a penny They come here and criticize what we have done but they cant produce a bill All the great legislative minds on their side of the aisle and we have been waiting patiently for them to produce a health care reform bill They cant or they dont want to Maybe they like the current health care system Maybe they think this is the way America should be Well many of us dont believe that and a lot of Americans dont either There are a lot of good parts of our system we want to protect but there are many parts that need to be changed We need to make health care and health insurance more affordable for families and individuals and businesses This bill does We just had another report from the Congressional Budget Office that said yes the cost of premiums will be coming down for many Americans as a result of this bill We also understand that some 50 million Americans dont have health insurance at all This bill will reach the highest level of protection for health insurance in the history of the United States Ninetyfour percent of people in this country will have the peace of mind and security of health insurancea dramatic increase The Republicans have been unable to come up with any proposal that moves us toward more coverage for people who dont have health insurance This bill also has many provisions to finally give consumers across America a chance to fight back when the insurance companies say no and they do all the time People who need critical surgical procedures and medicines people who need the kind of care their doctors recommend end up fighting with the clerk at an insurance company This bill the Democratic health care reform bill gives these families a fighting chance against these health insurance companies I have yet to see the first bill coming from the Republican side of the aisle in the course of this debate that would give our families a chance against these health insurance companies I wish to also say when I finish speaking and we finish on this side of the aisle the Senator from Utah will come and speak I understand it is the Medicare Advantage Program he will speak to Now the previous motion to commit by Senator MCCain of Arizona said Send this bill back and make sure you take out any reference to savings in the Medicare Advantage Program That was defeated The vote was 42 to 58 There were two Democrats who joined the Republicans They needed 60 votes it didnt make it I take it the Senator from Utah may offer another motion to commit relative to Medicare Advantage I expect it to have the same fate but he has his chance to argue his point of view and he may be persuasive to more Members on this side of the aisle Unfortunately although we are good close friends and I bask in his wisdom on a daily basis he is not going to change my mind on this issue because the Medicare Advantage Program is a program that needs to be changed Let me tell my colleagues about this program We started years ago with the health insurance industry telling us Government cannot do a good job when it comes to insurance Let us show you how private health insurance companies can sell a Medicare policy more cheaply than the government And we invited them to do it Over the course of the years some of them did They showed some savings and they demonstrated to us they could provide Medicare at a cost lower than the government But then things changed and the health insurance companies kept coming back and saying Well we actually need more money now to provide the same benefits in Medicare that the government provides At last count the Medicare Advantage Program costs 14 percent more to provide the same Medicare benefits as the government program So these leaders in the private sector who were going to teach us a lesson about how to sell insurance ended up failing their own lesson plan and now this Medicare Advantage Program has turned out to be a flatout subsidy to the health insurance industry170 billion over 10 years In other words the Medicare Program is paying more for Medicare than what it has to pay so it can subsidize health insurance companies which are turning multimilliondollar profits and giving bonuses to their CEOs Some on the other side of the aisle think we need to preserve this that we need to preserve this subsidy make sure we protect the profits of the health insurance companies and we need to protect Medicare Advantage Well as Senator Dodd has said so frequently on the Senate floor Medicare Advantage is neither Medicare nor an advantage I believe and most agree it is time for this party to end These private health insurance companies didnt keep their word didnt keep their promise and because of that we are in a situationa predicamentwhere we are asking other people covered by Medicare to subsidize the profits of these private health insurance companies What does it cost every Medicare recipient in America to provide this subsidy and profits to these private health insurance companies under Medicare Advantage Ninety dollars a year on average So those who are defending the Medicare Advantage Program as we currently know it and dont support the reforms in this bill are also supporting a 90 annual tax on Medicare recipients My fiscally conservative Republican friends who run against taxes every chance they have should reflect on the fact that they are protecting a tax on Medicare recipients That to me is indefensible It was very basic I would say to the Senator from Rhode Island through the Chair They just said Now listen When it comes to insurance the government never gets it right The bureaucrats who work for the government those Federal employees dont get it right We do this for a living We can show you how to provide Medicare benefits and save money So please would you just step aside The private health insurance companies are going to demonstrate to you how much money we can save Initially there were some savings I will say that in fairness But over the years they got greedy and their greediness led in most recent times toI think in 2003 if I am not mistaken with the Medicare prescription drug program when they came in and these same private health insurance companies said Now we really need subsidies to keep offering our wonderful programs now they tell us they are charging 14 percent more than basic Medicare President I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes I would say to the Senator from Ohio that is exactly what happened because what we have is that in order to pay for the subsidy the private health insurance companies that are selling Medicare Advantage they had to take the money out of the Medicare system which meant less money for everybody else It translated into 90 a year more for every Medicare recipient to pay for the subsidy for the private health insurance companies that are protected by Medicare Advantage I would say to the Senator from Ohio the difference is obvious With Medicare anyone who shows up age 65 is eligible for coverage no questions asked other than your age and whether you have contributed over the course of your lifetime These health insurance companies cherrypick the healthiest people they can then try to deny coverage where they can as well and that is how they make their profits Make it a triple whammy because the third impact of course is that the healthier people are not part of Medicare Those left in Medicare are sicker and more expensive so the governmentrun program ends up being more expensive because those private health insurance companies cherrypick out the healthiest people they can find There are those who want to defend Medicare Advantage who think it is great that we would pay 170 billion in subsidies to these companies over a 10year period of time This bill moves us away from that and says if these private health insurance companies cant basically compete and match what government Medicare offers then it is time for them to get out of the business and get out of the way I dont see why in the world we are arguing about a subsidy for private health insurance companies when they already make so much money So I would at this point yield the floor I know Senator Hatch has asked for an hour to speak on his motion I believe it is a motion to commit I yield the floor

0531; 0532; 0533, Back and forth and forth and forth and to and fro and this and that it works fine for me The PRESIDING OFFICER Ms Klobuchar The Senator from Delaware is recognized President how much time is remaining on the majority side The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Three minutes And on the minority side The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Fiftyfive minutes President I reserve the remainder of the majority time The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Tennessee President how much time remains under the control of the majority The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Twentyfour minutes President I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts We might be able to find extra time too if the Senator is looking for extra time Right now according to the number of Senators who want to speak that is all we have in this first block But sometimes we can work things outif the Senator wants to talk a little longer But right now it is 10 minutes The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Massachusetts President I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin the chairman of the Special Committee on Aging The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Wisconsin President how much time remains for the majority The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Five minutes I ask unanimous consent that there be an additional 5 minutes on each side The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Without objection it is so ordered President I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Oregon which should be 10 minutes The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Oregon is recognized President we are beginning our fifth day of consideration on the health reform bill We will be in a period of debate only until about 1130 am Pending now is the amendment by the Senator from Rhode Island Mr Whitehouse on fiscal responsibility Also pending is a motion to commit by the Senator from Utah on Medicare Advantage It would be my hope that the Senate will vote on these matters today Mr President I suggest the absence of a quorum The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The clerk will call the roll The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll President I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Without objection it is so ordered Under the previous order the time until 1130 am will be for debate only with the time equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees with the majority controlling the first portion of time The Senator from Montana is recognized President experts and economists of every political stripe agree that preserving Americas longterm economic security means reforming the way we provide and pay for health care Health care spending makes up onesixth of the US economy Future generations can expect the burden of insurmountable debt if we fail to act The fiscal challenges we may face in years to come pale in comparison to the threat of uncontrolled Federal health care spending The chart behind me essentially shows that The chart shows the percentage annual growth rates beginning in 2004 The red is the economy the blue is health care costs Clearly over time especially as the economy dipped during this great recession the gap between economic growth and health care spending has widened Projections are that in future years they will widen more and more As you can see out to 2018 the total economy is projected Near 2018 the economy is above 4 percent and health care spending is 7 or 8 percent Doing nothing means health care spending continues to grow faster than our economy That is what that chart shows quite dramatically Doing nothing means entitlement spending more than doubles by the year 2050 That is taking onefifth of our gross domestic product But it is not simply the Federal budget on the line it is the family budget too Incredibly in total we are spending 80 times as much on health care today as we did five decades ago80 times more on health care today than we did five decades ago Now family budgets are breaking under the strainalready That is going to get worse if we do nothing The cost of the average family health care plan will reach 24000 in the year 2016 That is not too many years away from now This represents an 84percent increase over 2008 premium levels That means if we do nothing in fewer than 10 years most families would have to dedicate half of their household budget to health insurance For years we have heard the warnings from Federal budget experts Now we are hearing every day from folks back home who simply cannot afford the care they need We have an obligation to act Now we have an opportunity to act The countrys leading economists and Federal budget experts laid out strategies and options for getting costs under control We have taken their recommendations to heart There is a lot of agreement among those who study these issues of what we must do Now we have a bill that does what they suggest It also passes the test of fiscal responsibility We have many reasons to vote for this bill It protects and even increases Medicare benefits for seniors It achieves near universal coverage in less than 10 years That means it achieves the goal of virtually everybody having health insurance in that period of time It slows the growth of Federal health care spending It stops insurance industry discrimination and based on independent nonpartisan analysis makes a serious dent in our Federal deficit This chart behind me represents what 2 weeks ago the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation confirmed in no uncertain terms that deficits go down under this plan The official cost estimate reads as follows The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Tax estimates that on balance the direct spending and revenue effects of enacting this Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act legislation would yield a net reduction in Federal deficits of 130 billion over the years 2010 to 2019 That is represented by the green bar on the left It is a net 130 billion reduction during the first 10 years of this bill In addition to reducing the Federal deficit in the first decade the CBO also tells us that the bill decreases the deficit by a much greater amount by 650 billion in the second decade According to the CBO this bill also slows the growth of Medicare costs which has been a principal goal in our Medicare debate since day one Medicare spending would grow 6 percent annually instead of 8 percent annually In other words Medicare would continue to grow but unlike today it will grow at a sustainable rate Of course no projections even from the Congressional Budget Office can be certain We can safely say this bill will put us on the right track We can safely say this bill is better than doing nothing No honest assessment challenges the case for acting now to slow the growth of Federal spending No honest assessment challenges the case And no honest assessment of this bill challenges the CBO analysis I have not heard one I have not heard an honest challenge to the CBO analysis nor have I heard of a good honest case for not acting now to slow the growth of Federal spending which means we have many reasons to pass health care reform not the least of which is the longterm financial health of the economy and our Nation But the reasons for passing this are much more than simply facts and figures This is about Americans from every corner of this great country struggling to make ends meet forced into bankruptcy by medical tragedy This is about stopping insurance industry discrimination this is about saving Medicare for our seniors and reducing the deficit for our grandchildren I dont know which other Senators wish to speak Senator Bingaman wishes to gain recognition in the time we have Let me ascertain how much time we have and how many speakers we have The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator has 40 minutes The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from New Mexico I might modify that so this side gets the next 30 minutes after that President if I may I ask unanimous consent that we extend for an additional hour the period for debate only with no further amendments or motions in order during the hour and that the time be equally divided between the two sides with the Republicans controlling the first 30 minutes and the majority controlling the second 30 minutes I believe there is 3 minutes remaining on the first block on the majority side The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore There is 2 minutes 20 seconds The Senator from Ohio is recognized President I think I will use my 2 minutes 20 seconds The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore And 15 seconds The Senator from Arizona talks about gee all these Medicare Advantage plans have dental and vision coverage He goes on to say so do Members of Congress The fact is that is not automatically true The fact is Members of Congress choose among various private plans Some plans offer dental and vision some do not Aetna is a company that Members of Congress could choose from under FEHBP and others that Members of Congress can choose from Those do provide dental and vision coverage But there are othersI think Blue Cross and Blue Shield does not provide dental and vision coverage I make that point because this is exactly what we are trying to set up in these exchanges People could participate in the exchanges where they would buy private coverage and they could choose among various private plans which coverage they want Do they want a plan that covers dental and vision or not That is exactly what we are trying to do in the exchange as is the case for Members of Congress Medicare Advantage plans do provide dental and vision I think that is great I see my time has expired At the appropriate time I wish to go into greater detail and explain why what we do in this bill I think makes eminent sense The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore The Senator from Iowa is recognized President I understand we are now under the order where there is a half hour allocated to the majority side is that correct President I just want to help people understand this legislation I am sure many do but I am sure there are some who do not with respect to the choices people will have We have a uniquely American system of health care in America It is roughly half public half private The goal of this legislation is to retain what we have that is basically have that same balance of public and private It has worked pretty well for America It is uniquely American We are not Canada We are not Great Britain We are not Switzerland We are the United States of America I think it is good to build on our current system and make our current system work better I am prompted to explain the choices in part by the statements by the senior Senator from Arizona who said Medicare Advantage plans enable people to get eyeglasses and dental care And that is true But he went on to say that gee shouldnt Members of Congress who like all that and want to keep all thatthat Members of Congress get free dental and free eyeglasses Well that is really not true Members of Congress do not get that But it is true Members of Congress participate inall Federal employees Members of Congress people in the Forest Service people all around the countryall Federal employees participate in the same system It is called FEHBP It is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan where Federal employees and Members of Congress all together the same can choose among many different private health insurance plans There is an open enrollment seasonin fact we are in the midst of it right nowwhere Members of Congress and all Federal employees can look to see if they want to choose a different insurance company or not Some of those companies do provide dental and vision coverage Some do not So if a Federal employee wants to choose a plan that covers dental and vision he or she can do so Just pay the premium and you are covered with dental and vision We are setting up under this legislation an exchange that is very similaralmost identicalto the FEHBP where people who do not have health insurance can go look on the exchange and choose among private companies which one makes the most sense for them Some may have dental some may have eyeglass coverage some may not That is just a choice people can make In addition to that there is even more choice because currently a Federal employee does not have to join FEHBP A Federal employee can choose not to get health insurance if he or she does not want to or maybe they get it through their spouse someplace else The same can be true with the exchange set up in this legislation The person could buy among different competing private plans that offer health insurance on the exchange or a person can go outside the exchange because he or she thinks they can get a better deal if that person wants to So I just want to make it clear that we are encouraging choice We are encouraging competition And I might say that under the legislation Members of Congress who fully participate in this will be coequal with others If there is a private option Members of Congress can participate in that as well In fact we are requiring Senators and their staffsthey do not have to participate in the exchange but it is certainly available to them and they can opt out if they want to Let me just say a little bit about Medicare Advantage What does MedPAC say about Medicare Advantage Several years ago Congress established an advisory board that is now called MedPAC to advise them on how Medicare should pay providers in traditional fee for service and private health insurers in Medicare Advantage Again Medicare Advantage is with private companies They have executives They have stockholders They are private companies MedPAC advises us how much Congress should pay MedPAC and other Medicare providers in traditional fee for service It is an independent agency Its experts are nonpartisan highly respected Each year they send a report to Congress that examines issues in Medicare Here is what MedPAC had to say about the current state of Medicare Advantage in its 2009 June report I am going to quote now from this independent advisory panel First we estimate that in 2009 Medicare pays about 12 billion more for enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans than it would if it were feeforservice Medicare Second Current high payments have resulted in some plans that bring no innovation but simply mimic feeforservice Medicare at a much higher cost to the program In other words they are saying that Medicare Advantage plans get paid for a lot more but with no innovation compared to the feefor service Medicare MedPAC says This situation is unfair to taxpayers and beneficiaries not enrolled in Medicare Advantage who subsidize the higher costs Well that is pretty obvious In addition MedPAC goes on to say The excessive payments encourage inefficient plans to enter the program further raising costs to Medicare There are so many dollars currently given to Medicare Advantage plans according to MedPAC that encourages inefficient plans to enter the program Why not They are getting all of this extra money Further quoting The cost of Medicare Advantage subsidies is borne by taxpayers who finance the Medicare program and by all Medicare beneficiaries via Part B premiums Or to say it differently about 78 percent of Americans who are not in Medicare Advantage plans are paying in effect a 90peryear tax for which they get no benefit which goes into the Medicare Advantage plans In addition The Part B premium for all beneficiaries is increased by about 3 a month regardless of whether you receive the benefit A couple of more quotes from MedPAC The additional Medicare Advantage payments hasten the insolvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund by 18 months That is an interesting statement The additional payments hasten the insolvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund by 18 months Going with quotes from MedPAC Although many plans are available only some are of high quality In addition continuing the quote Only about half of the beneficiaries nationwide have access to a plan that CMS rates as above average in overall plan quality This is what MedPAC says That is the nonpartisan expert that helps advise Congress on what reimbursement levels should be We have heard day after day that this bill is cutting Medicare benefits for our seniors When my colleagues on the other side of the aisle realized this bill does not cut reduce ration or eliminate a single guaranteed benefit they turned their argument to Medicare Advantage I think they finally recognize there are no guaranteed benefits cut in this legislation so they turn to Medicare Advantage They argue that the efficiencies and savings achieved by ending billions of dollars of overpayments to these private plans will either end the program or dramatically cut services to beneficiaries But lets just look at the numbers I have a chart behind me This chart shows the yearly spending for Medicare Advantage in billions of dollars So you can see from the chart that in the year 2009 110 billion will be spent on Medicare Advantage plans That is the far left Moving to the right 10 years later in the year 2019 about 204 billion is spent So if we total it all up about 17 trillion will be spent on Medicare Advantage plans over the next 10 years You see that littlewhat color is that It is kind of orange it is kind of an interesting sort of redwhatever it is at the top of that chart That represents the reduction in Medicare Advantage plan payments under this legislation It is not very much as you can tell by looking at the chart It averages out I think to around a 10 percent reduction in Medicare Advantage payments So when we see these big crocodile tears and we hear Medicare Advantage is being cut when we hear all of these dramatic statements that so much is going to be taken away from seniors because Congress is cutting Medicare Advantage the fact is we are reducing the rate of increase in Medicare Advantage payments by only about 10 percent and under this legislation about 17 trillion will be spent on Medicare Advantage plans Remember MedPAC says these are overpayments MedPAC says this 10 percent reduction is what they should be paid Remember too these are private plans These are private companies It is not Medicare These are private companies receiving these payments and they are insurance companies It is interesting to me that a lot of Members of Congress arent too wild about insurance companies Well Medicare Advantage companies are insurance companies That is what they are They are private insurance companies They are private insurance companies They have their private insurance company chief executive They have their private insurance company officer They have their private insurance company stockholders They have their private insurance company administrative costs and marketing expenses They are private insurance companies That is what they are So we should not lose sight of all of that I wish to also point out that as private insurance companies these Medicare Advantage plans are doing pretty well Let me quote from an Oppenheimer Capital analyst in a November 12 report about Medicare Advantage plans He said Between 2006 and 2009 we estimate that Medicare Advantage accounted for nearly 75 percent of the increase in gross profits among the larger plans in the industry highlighted by an estimated gross profit increase of 19 billion in 2009 relative to commercial risk earnings gains of nearly 600 million Commercial risk earnings gains are the ordinary health insurance companies but 75 percent of the gross profit increase was under Medicare Advantage plans not traditional health insurance I might say tooI dont have the papers maybe I can find them It is worth noting it underlines the point that these are private companies It is not traditional Medicare Here it is Because it is interesting lets look at the compensation of these insurance company executives of these Medicare Advantage plans the CEOs The total compensation of a CEO at Aetna is 24 million a year The total compensation of the CEO at Coventry is 9 million a year at Wellcare 8 million at Humana 47 million a year and at United Health Care 3 million Now people should be able to make some money and officers of companies should be able to do OK but here we are talking about very high salaries that these insurance companies pay to their top executives Frankly if there is a 10 percent reduction in the 17 trillion over 10 years they could you would think take some of that 10 percent maybe in salary reduction or dividends to stockholders make other cost savings It doesnt have to come out of the beneficiaries It is they the executives who are making these decisions of where the 10percent reduction is allocated Bottom line I just wish to say I am not opposed to Medicare Advantage plans Frankly I think it is good we have Medicare Advantage plans Medicare Advantage plans provide the competition to Medicare They help keep the system on its toes But we have an obligation as Members of this Senate to the taxpayers and to seniors to cut waste and to cut overpayments in a way that does not harm beneficiaries These are reductions recommended to Congress by the best advisory board of experts we could find They didnt just come out of thin air and Members of Congress thought this up This was recommended to us by the MedPAC advisory board Second there is no reduction in guaranteed benefits to seniors That is absolute There is no reduction in guaranteed benefits to Medicare Advantage participants So A we are being fair This chart shows it We are trying to find the right level of reimbursement set up in a way so there is no reduction in beneficiaries benefits In fact in this legislation we add more benefits for Medicare participants Medicare Advantage as well as traditional feeforservice Medicare I might add in this legislation we give an increase to Medicare Advantage plans that show demonstrated improvement in quality As I mentioned MedPAC said a lot of these plans are totally inefficient A lot of these plans have no coordinated care A lot of these plans dont have any quality but they get the extra money So we are saying lets get to a compensation level that is fair We do it on a competitive bidding basis take the average bid for an area and we also say lets make sure there is no reduction in guaranteed benefits at the same time I think that is a responsible thing to do So all of these arguments these sound bites frankly that you hear from the other side of the aisle are just that they are sound bites They are not the honest analysis of what is going on So I encourage us to keep in mind keep in perspective what we are doing so we can help provide a better health care system for our country This is only one part of it There are many other parts but this is just this one part How much time do we have remaining Mr President At this time I yield to the Senator from Michigan I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Wyoming be recognized to speak for debate only and at a later point we will figure out allocation of time on both sides if he wishes to speak now President I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin President the pending motion would strike the savings the bill achieves from Medicare Advantage Why are we seeking savings from Medicare Advantage Because MedPAC tells us that the government pays the private insurance companies that provide Medicare Advantage 14 percent more than we pay traditional Medicare because these extra subsidies to Medicare Advantage cost the fourfifths of seniors in traditional Medicare 90 more a year in premiums even though they get no benefits from Medicare Advantage because MedPAC says that the additional Medicare Advantage payments hasten the insolvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund by 18 months because the private insurance companies that provide Medicare Advantage are making threequarters of their profits from these government overpayments and they can find some of the savings there because private insurance companies that provide Medicare Advantage are paying their CEOs 24 million 9 million and 8 million a year and they could find some of the savings there and because nothing we do in our bill reduces benefits under Medicare Therefore I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion President the Senator from Arkansas is to be recognized to offer an amendment Amendment No 2905 to Amendment No 2786 President I think we are going to go back and forth here Sorry Here is Senator Kaufman President I have heard a lot here today about how this is going to hurt seniors and so on and so forth words such as smokescreen The fact is there is no smokescreen here whatsoever This is a very well thought out considered policy that I think strikes a very good balance between getting care to especially seniors at home which is so important on the one hand and making sure there is not waste on the other hand That is our responsibility here to make sure the program works and works well I have sort of a special interest in this My mother was in the hospital It happened about 2 weeks ago She fortunately is doing much better She is out of the hospital She has spent some time with a home health caregiver with whom I was very very impressed This home health person is doing a great job with my mother I have seen other instances too but personally I was very happy to see my mother getting very good care from a home health care nurse I think it is also important to remind my colleagues that this amendment is generally a retread on the MCCain amendment we debated over the last few days That is once again the opponents of this bill are endorsing the status quo that leaves Medicare on the brink of going bankrupt and seniors facing higher costs Let me remind my colleagues again what will happen if we stick with the status quo The status quo meaning no bill which the other side is advocating means Medicare will go broke in 8 years That is the status quo In our legislation that will be postponed for at least 5 more years The status quo as in no bill which the other side is advocating means seniors will continue to pay higher and higher premiums and cost sharing due to wasteful overpayments to health care providers There is so much waste in our system We all know there is a lot of waste I am quite surprised not all of our colleagues want to cut out the waste In effect they want to keep the waste that unfortunately is in our system The status quo also means each year billions of Medicare dollars will continue to be wasted on lining the pockets of private insurance companies That might be a bit of a strong statement but the fact is some chief executives of private insurance companies are paid tens of millions of dollars to manage Medicare Programs especially Medicare Advantage and the status quo means that will continue The status quo also means seniors will continue struggling to pay for prescription drugs The stakes for seniors in the Medicare Program have never been higher We have a choice It is a very simple choice either endorse the status quo or strengthen Medicare Lets talk a little bit about home health care Regarding Medicare changes for home health providers let me describe what is in the Senate bill I dont think our colleagues know specifically what is in the Senate bill That may be a strong statement to make But if they knew what was in the bill I think some of the statements made tonight might be a little bit different As most of my colleagues would agree home health care is an extremely important benefit in the Medicare Program We are all very strong advocates of home health care Across the country there are more than 9800 home health agencies providing care to seniors in their homes This helps seniors get better and helps them to avoid expensive rehospitalizations We are all champions of home health care We would like people not to be institutionalized It is much more appropriate to have care in the home and home health care agencies provide that In Montana home health care providers go the extra mileliterally to provide care to patients across vast distances In some cases in rural areas they have to drive 100 miles just to see one patient They are dedicated people They go great distances and travel a long way to see very few patients Home health providers make a real difference in improving seniors health and we should support their efforts We all very much support their efforts While I have great respect for the services of home health providers we also have a responsibility to protect the Medicare Program Unfortunately there is almost always waste somewhere It is a matter of judgment as to how much is waste and how much is not We must make sure Medicare is paying appropriately that is that Medicare is not overpaying for Medicare services We must take action to root out fraud and abuse in the Medicare Program generally and where it may occur in the home health industry as well I think the policies in the Senate bill achieve both goals First the Senate bill would rebase home health payments to ensure payments reflect actual costs of providing care These changes are based on recommendations by MedPAC which is the independent advisory commission that advises Congress on Medicare reimbursement It is a nonpartisan group MedPAC advises that we rebase What do we mean by rebase When the current home health payments were set seniors received an average of 31 visits per episode Today they receive 22 visits that is they get paid about the same for doing less We are trying to make sure the payment reflects the actual services provided The Senate bill directs CMS to rebase payments to reflect this change It is common sense MedPAC recommended it and thinks it has to keep up with the times Times have changed over the years and the payment system should reflect that change There is something else I think is pretty important and most of my colleagues would agree the Senate bill roots out fraud that unfortunately exists in home health care as well as in other areas of Medicare spending It tries to root out the fraud in Medicare payments for outlier cases Medicare provides an extra payment today for providershome health folkswho treat sicker people otherwise known as outlier patients really sick outliers Unfortunately the GAO found that some providers were gaming the system and getting much more outlier payments than they deserve For example the GAO found that in one Florida county alone home health providers were receiving 60 percent of all total outlier payments That is nationwide One county was getting 60 percent even though they had less than 1 percent of the total Medicare population I dont want to just single out Florida Other counties in the southern part of the country clearly have a grossly disproportionate amount of high outlier payments The Senate addresses this problem by placing a cap on the amount any individual provider can receive in outlier payments Another change is the bill makes market basket changes in 2011 and 2012 That was recommended by MedPAC Why is that important MedPAC is actually much tougher They wanted to start in 2010 We said we will hold off a bit We wanted to be fair to the home health providers In addition the bill establishes a productivity adjustment for home health providers beginning not right away not next year or the following year but in 2015 These changes ask home health providerslike all other providersto offer more efficient and higher quality care over time We are being fair about it Very importantly in making these changes we worked closely with the home health industry to ensure these changes were reasonable and fair What do we do with respect to the agencies to make sure we are fair On the rebasing policy MedPAC recommended that we fully implement these changes in 2011 To ensure that providers can adapt to the new payment rates we in the Senate decided we would phase in these changes over 4 years The home health providers support this phase in They think it is a good idea On the outlier policy and the fraud changes these policies were actually suggested to us byguess whothe home health industry They came to us and suggested we make some changes in outliers because too many agencies are gaming the system They asked us to make some outlier changes and stop that gaming to make changes to stop the fraud They came to us and gave us some ideas Obviously the home health industry fully supports the changes they recommended to us They are in this bill On the market basket and productivity changes the Senate bill holds off on applying these reductions while the rebasing policy is taking effect This bill gives home health agencies extra timemuch more time than is recommended by the very aggressive proposed changes by MedPAC the House bill and the administration We say those are too aggressive We in the Senate decided to give agencies extra time to adapt to the payment changes in the bill rather than having all these implemented at the same time as MedPAC and the House and the administration all recommended Finally with respect to rural home health providers we are all very sensitive to the special needs of rural America What did we do about that From 2010 to 2015 rural providers will receive a 3percent extra payment each year This payment will ensure that rural providers are protected as we reform the home health system In total the home health changes in the Senate bill I believe strike a fair balance between ensuring seniors have access to home care while also rooting out inappropriate payments from the system I hear some of my good friends say Gee these changes are going to hurt seniors They are not going to hurt them In fact most of the changes are suggested by the home health care industry I think all of us want to root out fraud and waste Also it is claimed that Medicare beneficiaries will be harmed by this bill This is a scare tactic Let me say what the American Association of Retired Persons says about these claims that these changes in Medicare reimbursement are going to harm seniors AARP says Opponents of the health reform wont rest They are using myths and misinformation to distort the truth and wrongly suggesting that Medicare will be harmed After a lifetime of hard work dont seniors deserve better That is AARP I dont suggest tonight that any of our colleagues are using myths and misinformation to distort the truth The point is AARP claims that is not true They support the bill strongly I will remind my colleagues of some of the positive changes in the legislation This legislation improves the solvency of the Medicare Program by 5 years It puts 30 billion back into the pockets of seniors in the form of lower Medicare premiums It makes prescription drugs more affordable which is an added benefit in this bill that would not be available if the legislation is not passed The bill guarantees that seniors can continue to see a doctor of their choosing The bill provides free wellness and prevention benefits Those are new benefits They dont currently exist It will also include fair and appropriate changes for home health that protect access to care I dont question the motives of my colleagues They believe they are standing up for seniors in opposing the home health changes But in truth they will harm them because they are hurting the Medicare Program I dont think we want to hurt the Medicare Program We are trying to help the Medicare Program by making these changes There is one other point I want to make This is kind of interesting I thought when I saw itif I still have itit is kind of interesting The growth rate in home health care spending will continue to be very high after this legislation passes Currently the growth rate of the home health care industry is almost 11 percent per year After the legislation it will be almost an 8percent annual growth in the home health care industry That is much faster than the national health expenditures I think most things in life are a judgment call I think one fairly decides that the changes in this bill are good for seniors and home health care providers because they are sensitive to the needs of the industry sensitive to patients frankly but also responsible to the American taxpayers by making sure we are rooting out waste President I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to a period of morning business with Senators permitted to speak up to 10 minutes each President I ask unanimous consent that Sarah Allen Ryan Nalty and Grant Jamieson staff of the Finance Committee be granted the privilege of the floor for the duration of debate on the health care bill The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore Without objection it is so ordered President I ask unanimous consent that Sara Velde of

S_DE_KAUFMAN,2009-12-04,2009_2009; 2009_2009,0137; 0138, Madam President I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for up to 5 minutes President I wish to honor the service of a great Federal employee Human ingenuity is boundless This is especially true in America which has always been driven by an entrepreneurial spirit and a belief that nothing is impossible From Whitneys cotton gin to the first elevator from the electric telegraph to the refrigerated rail car our forbearers used their ingenuity to help build a nation Such invention and perseverance closed the western frontier in the nineteenth century In the century that followed Americans continued to be pioneers on that frontier which has no endthe frontier of science Sixtyseven years ago this week a team of American physicists led by Enrico Fermi conducted a critical experiment On a cold winters afternoon they huddled under the stands of the old football stadium at the University of Chicago Using graphite blocks wooden rods and uranium pellets they initiated the firstever controlled nuclear reaction That experiment called Chicago Pile One marked the beginning of the nuclear age Today all Americans know that the discovery of nuclear power was a mixed blessing With it came the potential for a new form of energy to power our homes and businesses For the first time our naval ships could remain at seaand on guardfor extended periods without refueling But with nuclear energy came nuclear weapons These led to the dangerous prospect of the mass destruction of hundreds of cities within minutes They brought us a generation of duck and cover and backyard fallout shelters Thankfullythough our nation and others continue to possess these weapons in our timethe Cold War is over No longer are we minutes from mutually assured destruction the way we once were Today peaceful nuclear energy provides a fifth of our electricity and there are 104 civilian reactors in operation across the country Developing and enforcing the regulations that keep these reactors safe are the men and women of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission This week I wish to recognize the contribution of an outstanding public servant Dr Gareth Parry Gareth has had a distinguished career at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission advancing our nuclear safety He is also a 2004 recipient of the distinguished Arthur S Flemming Award for public service Gareth who immigrated to this country from the United Kingdom has over thirty years of experience in developing models for probabilistic risk analysisor PRA He retired this September after a long and distinguished career As senior adviser on PRA for the Commissions Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation Gareth became one of the leading experts on analyzing common cause failure and human reliability His work led to the development of PRA standards and the use of PRA to support risk informed decisionmaking with regard to nuclear safety Gareth as a scientist and a public servant worked hard to ensure the safety of Americas civilian nuclear facilities The kind of work he performed is highly mathematical and complex and it may not sound glamorous to the average American but it is critical and contributes enormously to the security and economic wellbeing of our Nation Sixtyseven years ago Fermi and his team first harnessed the power of the atom Today the men and women of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ensure that our modern nuclear reactors continue to do so safely I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring the service of Dr Gareth Parry and all who have workedand continue to workat the Nuclear Regulatory Commission President tonight the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty will expire and with it the primary framework for the reduction of nuclear weapons for the last 20 years Today I would like to speak a few minutes about the critical importance of an offensive strategic arms reduction and why we must establish a followon treaty to START In September President Obama proposed a resolution to the United Nations Security Council to eliminate nuclear weapons ban production of the fissile material outlaw nuclear tests and safeguard existing weapons stockpiles World leaders approved the resolution joining with the Presidents previous statements that America seeks a world with no nuclear weapons This is not a vision of unilateral disarmament but a vision for multilateral action It is a vision of working step by step with every nation to draw down nuclear arsenals together It is a critically important goal and one of the best ways to ensure a safer future and a safer world In the past few years we have seen a rise in clandestine nuclear programs developed by rogue states including those which have successfully acquired a nuclear arsenal This growing threatprimarily from North Korea and Iranunderscores the value of international strategic arms treaties These are global challenges which require global solutions and a multilateral approach The best way to combat proliferation is unity of the international community and I am pleased that one of the greatest successes of President Obamas policy of engagement with Iran has been a growing convergence of views identifying Irans nuclear program as a threat not just to one region but to the world While multilateralism is the best way to effectively reduce the threat posed by nuclear weapons we must look to successful bilateral agreements as a model including START This historic agreement laid the groundwork for a common understanding between the United States and Russia regarding nuclear weapons and truly symbolized the end of the Cold War It allowed us to talk about previously taboo subjects such as the Triad and intrusive verification and develop a shared language of expertise and evaluation that reduced our nuclear arsenals More importantly it provided a process of arbitration that avoids confrontation establishes legal mechanisms to forever avoid a nuclear war The stability START provided allowed both the United States and Russia to reduce our nuclear stockpiles and engage in negotiations about curbing proliferation worldwide It also built great confidence in the other as a partner Since its inception START has served as an enabler of global nonproliferation efforts Now this critical treaty is set to expire and it is time to move to establish a followon which reflects the requirements of the 21st century and allows the United States and Russia to continue this valuable partnership in nonproliferation together This is why I am a cosponsor of legislation which provides a legal basis for extending the START verification regime and I strongly support the work of the Obama administrationunder the leadership of Assistant Secretary of State for Verification and Compliance Rose Gottemoellerto negotiate the followon treaty We owe it to Americans to place consideration of the new treaty at the top of the agenda when it is submitted so the United States can continue to pave the way toward a safer and more secure world 
S_KS_ROBERTS,2009-12-04,1997_2009; 1997_2009; 1997_2009; 1997_2009; 1997_2009,0047; 0046; 0044; 0045; 0048, Madam President I rise today in support of the motion of my good friend from Nebraska my colleague from Nebraska Senator Johanns tothe official words say to commit the bill back to the Senate Finance Committee with instructions to strike the cuts to the Medicare home health care benefit What the distinguished Senator is trying to do is bring some common sense to the cuts to a very vital source of health care not only to rural areas but all over this country and that is home health care The bill we are considering the bill sometimes called the behind closed doors bill would cut home health care by 42 billion The Senator from Nebraska says that is a headscratcher and it certainly is It is more than a head scratcher it is a Lizzie Borden amputation in regard to a vital program Home health care is critical for our seniors Obviously that is the truth As the cochair of the Senate Rural Health Care Caucus I certainly understand that So does the Senator from Nebraska He was saying yesterday how many times he visits his rural hospitals rural clinics rural hospices and you do that a lot if you are from Nebraska or Iowa or Texas or Kansas At any rate in my home State of Kansas and other rural areas many seniors live alone or out in the country miles away from a local hospital or a doctors office Even if they have a very good doctor they cant get there because of their health condition So home health care allows those seniors the freedom and the independence to stay in their home in the comfort of knowing somebody is there assisting their health care needs More importantly home health care is the cost effective care as the Senator from Nebraska has pointed out that keeps the senior out of a nursing home or hospital andguess what saves the government money Over the long term if you cut home health care you are going to increase the cost in regard to nursing homes no question about it In my State I have had the pleasure of being able to see firsthand as has the Senator from Nebraska the great work our Kansas Home Health Care Association members do every day Last year I was invited into the home of a lovely couple in Concordia KS America not too far from Nebraska and despite having multiple health issues Duane and Phyllis were able to stay in their home with their little dog Josie all thanks to the services provided by a home health care aide and a home nurse What is going to happen to seniors such as Duane and Phyllis if we slash 42 billion from home health care payments Fortytwo billion dollars is one of the largest Medicare cuts in the whole bill next to Medicare Advantage and the hospitals The Senator from Nebraska had that chart showing serious cuts to all of our providers Dont forget that this cut comes on the heels of several years of additional cuts to home health carearound 35 billion all toldthat already have a large percentage of Kansas home health care agencies operating at very slim or negative Medicare margins I know the same is true in Iowa and the same is true in Texas in Montana in Nebraska and all over the country I keep hearing my colleagues however on the other side of the aisle insisting that their 12 trillion cut to all Medicarehere is the quotewont affect the benefits guaranteed to seniors Please stop that Please stop that That is the most disingenuous smokescreen in this whole debate It may be true that this bill does not explicitly cut benefits My friends across the aisle however cannot deny that their cuts in reimbursements to providers will affect those benefits because when you cut the reimbursements to providers guess who pays the price The patientsDuane and Phyllis and their little dog Josie I tell you what You come to their house and you make that argument that if you close down or make cuts to home health care Duane is not going to like it Phyllis is not going to like it and Josie will bite you on your leg As I said many of my Kansas home health care agencies are already operating at negative margins Their projected share of these cuts as provided by the distinguished Senator from Nebraska is almost 240 million To the Senator from Montana the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee my dear friend that is 60 million in Montana and Nevada where the distinguished majority leader lives the chart that has been provided to me by the Senator 263 million We have Senator Cornyn sitting right behind me here Senator Cornyn you are in the 68 billion category for Texas I might ask the Senator What is going to happen if you get cut 68 billion in regard to home health care service We could go back and back sirI do not careand then forth and forth The Senator from Nebraska has already pointed out what happens in Nebraska and I know what will happen in Kansas Nearly twothirds of Kansas home health care agencies will have negative margins within only 5 years probably 2 or 3 if these cuts are allowed to occur How are these agencies supposed to stay in business with these kinds of cuts The home health care benefit will be worthless to a Kansas Medicare patient whose home health care agencies will go out of business So yes in fact this bill will effectively cut benefits Again get rid of the smokescreen This doesnt apply just to the home health care benefit The same can be said for the effect of the cuts as demonstrated by the Senator from Nebraska for reimbursements to hospitals This bill is going to cost the Kansas Hospital Association 15 billion They have some outside experts who came in I asked them What is going to be the effect of the cuts They already have cuts They only get reimbursed 70 percent now and 15 billion on top of that We ought to have a chartand I am sure we will have a chartthat would show Iowa or Nebraska or any State here Texas especially because of the number of folks there So hospitals hospices skilled nursing facilities and all of the rest I want every senior to know that while maybe it is technically accurate again for my friends across the aisle to claim this bill doesnt cut Medicare benefits there is no wayno wayyou can slash 12 trillion from payments to providers without affecting their ability to keep their door open especially in rural and small town America Seniors should know they will be left with a worthless benefit To paraphrase my friend Senator Alexander from Tennessee it would be like having a bus ticket without a bus Thank you Senator Johanns Thank you for the work you are doing Thank you for this motion I hope we are successful I hope people will wake up and understand the severity of what these cuts will do I urge every Member of this Senate to support Senator Johanns when we come to a vote on this issue Thank you Mr President I yield the floor The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Kaufman The Senator from Montana is recognized 
S_TX_CORNYN,2009-12-04,2002_2009; 2002_2009,0080; 0081,8 billion would cut not just into the muscle but into the bone and deny a lot of elderly people particularly in rural areas access to care entirely President I think as the American people are listening to the debate we are having on health care reform they are being asked to accept some pretty implausible claims One claim is that we can take 12 trillion out of Medicare and it would not have any impact on the delivery of services to Medicare beneficiaries12 trillion I think the biggest mistake about the way this bill is paid for with the huge tax increases and huge cuts in Medicare is the proposal to take 12 trillion out of Medicare including 40 billion out of home health care in order to pay for a brandnew entitlement program when we already know Medicare itself is on a fiscally unsustainable path I want to talk primarily about another aspect of these cuts and that is the 11 million seniors including 532000 Texans who will lose benefits under their Medicare Advantage Program because these are not inconsequential cuts in their benefits They are serious I want to talk about some real human beings some real Texans who are going to be affected in a negative way by these cuts First of all I think it is absolutely critical for the American people to understand that Medicare itself does not provide complete coverage to seniors That is why so many seniors end up buying supplemental insurance coverageMedigap coverage as it is sometimes calledin order to get their bills paid for Medicare only pays on average about 80 percent to providers of what private health insurance does That is the reason without additional compensation many doctors will not see a new Medicare patient They simply cannot do it and keep their doors open to their other patients The truth is Medicare Advantage was created to fix some of the flaws with Medicare fee for service to give seniors more affordable and better coordinated health care None of us are standing up saying the proposed bill is all bad because some of the positive developments in the bill call for greater coordination of health care On balance it makes things worse than it does better because of these cuts in things such as Medicare Advantage The President of the United States has said providing Americans with a choice of quality affordable health care was a guiding principle for him I agree with that statement of principle Medicare Advantage was created for that very purpose because as I said Medicare itself does not always work well for patients Where I live in Austin TX which is Travis County the last time I saw a report only 17 percent of physicians will see a new Medicare patient because Medicare reimbursement rates are so low Those problems are avoided in large part by Medicare Advantage because it pays physicians and providers better than Medicare fee for service According to the American Medical Associations 2008 national health insurance report card Medicarenot private health insurancebut Medicare had the highest percentage and the largest number of denied medical claims In fact Medicare denied 10 times more medical claims than private health insurers That is another reason why seniors deserve a choice between Medicare and private plans that will offer them better benefits As I mentioned today 11 million Americans made that choice of better benefits and better care coordination through the Medicare Advantage Program The proposed bill the Reid bill will take away those choices and the benefits of those 11 million seniors by cutting about 120 billion from the program Many of our friends across the aisle will say we can cut 120 billion out of Medicare Advantage and it will have no impact on delivery of services But the Director of the Congressional Budget Office disagrees with them who says their additional benefits will be cut roughly in half We need to set the record straight on these socalled overpayments allegedly going to insurance company profits It is simply a false statement It is not true Our colleagues know the socalled overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans do not go into those plans They go to seniors in the form of additional benefits That is because under Federal law 75 percent of additional payments to Medicare Advantage plans are used to provide seniors with additional benefits benefits which they would not get under Medicare fee for service benefits such as chronic care management hearing aids eyeglasses and the like The other 25 percent of any extra payments is returned to the Federal Government Lets be clear Cuts to Medicare Advantage would be taking away seniors health care benefits for those 11 million seniors As I mentioned 12 million Texans are on Medicare Advantage and the Reid bill would cut their benefits by well over half You do not have to take my word for it Listen to what the CBO Director Dr Elmendorf said when Senator Crapo asked him during a Finance Committee hearing He said So approximately half of the additional benefit would be lost to those current Medicare Advantage policy holders Director Elmendorf For those who would be enrolled otherwise under current law yes Nearly one out of every four seniors in Texas would lose about 122 a month in health care benefits to create a new 25 trillion entitlement that their grandchildren will ultimately have to end up paying for And 122 a month may not sound like a lot for people inside the beltway but a couple from my hometown of San Antonio recently wrote to me Please vote to leave our Medicare Advantage plans alone We cant afford anything else as our portfolio was wiped out in the stock market collapse last year My wife and I have had to go back to work and we are in our seventies Yet this bill would impose another 122permonth cut in their benefits Another constituent of mine from Conroe TX wrote Please do what you can to protect the Medicare Advantage plans Im on one and it has been beneficial to me It has saved me an enormous amount of money and given me the benefits Ive needed Some groups that support these cuts to Medicare Advantage have a conflict of interest to say the least because the benefits under traditional fee for service as I mentioned for Medicare is about 80 percent of what private insurance will pay In order to get coverage in order to pay the bills many seniors have had to buy additional insurance coverage For 11 million seniors Medicare Advantage provides those benefits For many seniors former employers sometimes provide wraparound plans For retired military TRICARE provides a wraparound plan For many lowincome seniors Medicaid helps with cost sharing and premiums For many other seniors they purchase a standalone Medigap policy We heard from our friends across the aisle about AARPs endorsement of the Medicare cuts in the Reid bill If it sounds odd that a seniors advocacy group would support taking nearly 12 trillion from an already near bankrupt program it should The fact is as the Washington Post noted on October 27 But not advertised in this lobbying campaign have been AARPs substantial earnings from insurance royalty and the potential benefits that could come its way from many of the reform proposals Democratic proposals to slash reimbursements for another program called Medicare Advantage are widely expected to drive up demand for private Medigap policies like the ones offered by AARP according to health care experts legislative aides and documents So AARP the socalled seniors advocacy group is advocating for a cut in benefits to 11 million beneficiaries of Medicare Advantage The suggestion is one reason they would do so is because they will profit from this bill because these seniors will if they can afford it have to go out and buy Medigap coverage from lo and behold entities such as AARP The fact is Medicare Advantage allows private plans to innovate better and provides better coordinated care for seniors Groups such as the KelseySeybold Clinic in Houston TX which is basically not seeing Medicare feeforservice patients but is seeing Medicare Advantage patients because they can afford to coordinate care the kinds of things we know they ought to be doing to provide better care but they cannot afford to do it on the feeforservice Medicare We have had the Medicare Program around for more than 40 years The fact is government bureaucrats are still trying to get the complex reimbursement formulas right We know as the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee has said that under the feeforservice program which is part of what needs to be reformed in this health care bill Medicare pays for volume and not value Some of the positive things which I have complimented the bill on is it includes some small steps to change our current payforvolume program to a payforvalue approach through various delivery system reform demonstration programs The irony is Medicare did not think of these delivery system reforms rather Washington is finally catching up on what private sector innovators have been doing for years We heard the distinguished Senator from Minnesota talk about the Mayo Clinic The Mayo Clinic has been doing that I mentioned KelseySeybold in Texas But private sector innovators have been doing this through the Medicare Advantage Program already The delivery system reforms in the Reid bill would allow Medicare to experiment with different approaches to changing physician incentives such as accountable care organizations or physician quality reporting initiatives Will they work I happen to think they will We do know private sector innovators have already figured out how to change physician incentives in the sorts of ways we ought to be doing more of and not punishing by cutting Medicare Advantage One Medicare Advantage plan HealthSpring serves 20000 seniors in my State They have been a leader for changing incentives for physicians to focus on quality rather than quantity I met with their leadership and heard how they have done it What they told me is they have a collaborative partnership with their physicians They call it Partnership for Quality Physicians are accountable for both cost and quality based on an evidencebased set of quality measures The results are a winwin better quality care leading to healthier seniors and physicians who succeed in meeting evidencebased quality standards and ultimately lower health care costs which I thought was supposed to be one of the goals of health care reform Participating physicians were paid financial incentives for meeting their goal but as a result of coordination of care and evidencebased quality standards they actually ended up charging less and patients experienced better results too Members needed fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits Preventive measures increased mammograms by 80 percent diabetic foot exams by 360 percent and flu vaccinations by 246 percent I have heard about HealthSprings success from a couple in Farmers Branch TX who recently wrote to me They said We had a Medicare supplemental policy for several years until they priced themselves out of the market We are now with a Medicare Advantage plan called HealthSpring We have been very happy with this plan and the way they are saving us money Please do not change or eliminate this program Let me tell you about one other Texas company called WellMed While the Reid bill would finally give Medicare the ability to experiment with medical homes and care coordination a San Antoniobased company a Medicare Advantage company called WellMed has been using a medical home model to coordinate patient care and emphasize prevention for nearly 20 years To quote from an article last month in Inside San Antonio The health care delivery model at WellMed puts the patient at the center of a team directed by a primary care physician The team may include a nurse health coach hospitalist social service worker and physician assistant According to WellMed CEO Dr George Rapier We really do have to bring back the oldtime primary care doctor who cared for you who was concerned about you who was part of your family and you were part of their family Its a primary care physician who knows all about you So if you need a specialist they know the best specialist to send you to If you need to go in the hospital they make sure you get the appropriate care in the hospital They are your coordinator of care And thats really the concept of a medical home There is no question in my mind that the model has been saving lives in my State Here is a story about one Texan whose life was saved by physicians caring for him at WellMed For years Crohns disease weakened We will call him Ed Eds immune system and left him susceptible to infections One morning in 2001 he lacked energy to even get out of bed His breathing became labored He developed a cough that sounded wet His worried wife called his primary care physician at WellMed Dr Marlene Sanchez who wanted Ed hospitalized immediately so she could order a nuclear scan of his lungs He protested She told me that if he refused to go I should call 911 and have the paramedics come get him his wife Annette recalled He heard Dr Sanchez talking to me the urgency in her voice and that convinced him to go The scan confirmed Dr Sanchezs suspicions A potentially fatal blood clot had traveled from Eds leg to his lungs He was successfully treated and recovered Ed and his wife recently celebrated Eds 74th birthday Annette credits Dr Sanchez for saving Eds life and for acting as a catalyst that keeps him thriving in their golden years We have seen an abundance of doctors from the cancer doctors to the dermatologist gastroenterologist the blood doctor the heart specialistEd has gone through it all and theyve all been coordinated by his primary care doctor Ive been to other doctors outside WellMed and you dont get the feeling that they are communicating like this Well many Texas seniors currently enjoy these extra benefits under Medicare Advantage such asanother benefitthe Silver Sneakers program the Nations leading exercise program for older Americans This past year one of the Silver Sneakers members personally visited my office to deliver testimonials from other Silver Sneakers members One Texan said At my age I need a program to strengthen me all over but primarily to help me with my balance and coordination I need these skills to keep me from falling and breaking my bones Another participant in the Silver Sneakers program said I am 66 have been in the Silver Sneakers program a year Prior to that I led a sedentary life which included many health problems I had hypertension high cholesterol chronic bladder condition and mild depression Since coming to classes and utilizing the weights and cardio machines my life has improved immensely My blood pressure has dropped my cholesterol has been lowered my chronic bladder condition has improved and I just feel better all around I am no longer depressed because I look better and look forward to going to class and visiting with my friends These cuts in Medicare Advantage are going to have a direct impact on the benefits my constituents in Texas are benefiting fromthe 532000 Texans who are currently on Medicare Advantageand what they are asking mewhich I cant answeris why in the world would we want to cut Medicare Advantage which actually works as opposed to Medicare fee for service which does not work well Why would we take a fiscally unsustainable program such as Medicare which is going insolvent in 2017 and use that to create a 25 trillion new entitlement program My constituents the seniors who have paid into Medicare all these years are saying It is not fair to take the money we have paid into Medicare and use it to create yet another entitlement program and not to fix Medicare itself So I believe we need to fix Medicares nearly 38 trillion in unfunded liabilities We need to fix the improper payment rate of roughly 1 out of every 10 Medicare dollars which results in somewhere on the order of a minimum of 60 billion of fraudulent payments each year We need to put it on a fiscally sustainable path rather than taking 12 trillion from Medicare for another illconceived Washington health care takeover I dont believe my constituents believe you can take 12 trillion out of these programs just as they do not believe you can take more than 100 billion out of Medicare Advantage and it will have no impact on their benefits They dont buy it They dont believe it and I dont either Mr President I yield the floor 
S_NJ_MENENDEZ,2009-12-11,2006_2009; 2006_2009; 2006_2009,0069; 0070; 0071, What is the pending business before the Senate I rise about a program funded in that conference report It is a program that we put under the framework of Cuba broadcasting It is surrogate broadcasting into a closed society a society for which the State controls all information or attempts to control all information to its 11 million citizens It is a part of a long tradition of the United States with the Voice of America type of broadcasting the effort to try to bring a free flow of information into countries in the world which are governed by despotic rulers We did this successfully in the former Soviet Union We did it successfully in Eastern Europe and during the changes in the Czech Republic then Czechoslovakia Poland the Solidarity movement and many others We have been proud of that history of bringing the free flow of information We now try to use it in different parts of the world based on the new challenges we have One of those places in the world in which we do this surrogate broadcasting is into the island of Cuba because it has a repressive regime that will not allow the free flow of information to go to its people We have a program called Radio and Television Marti Marti is sort of like the George Washington of Cuba It is named after him In 1983 Congress passed the Radio Broadcasting to Cuba Act to provide the people of Cuba through Radio Marti with information the Cuban Government would try to censor and keep from them Subsequently in 1990 Congress authorized US television broadcasting to Cuba through Radio and Television Marti to support the right of the Cuban people to receive information and ideas they would not normally receive It opened radio and television broadcasting to Cuba provided a consistently reliable and authoritative source of accurate objective and comprehensive news commentary and other information about events in Cuba and elsewhere It did so to promote the cause of freedom inside of Cuba We know there is a long history of repressive regimes trying to block our surrogate broadcasting around the world They just dont simply sit back and say Send it all in Let me accept whatever it is you are sending in That is not their effort Their effort is to block And our difficulty with broadcasting has never been a justification for cutting funding for these programs We have never submitted to the proposition that when a regime tries to block our surrogate broadcastingwhether it was Voice of America Radio Free Europe all of those efforts there was always blocking taking placethat that is a cause or justification for cutting funding It should not be a different standard now I ask when it comes to Cuba broadcasting why the double standard In fact especially now when change is coming to Cuba it is in our interest to have the capacity to broadcast information to the Cuban people I want to show one of the charts that may be a little difficult back at home but these are actual photographs which came from a January 2009 Government Accountability Office report which were provided by an organization that reports on Cuban affairs It depicts evidence of Cubans ability to watch Television Marti despite Cuban jamming efforts These pictures were taken from inside of Cuba They may not be the best picture quality although I doubt they have digital television inside of Cuba But nonetheless they have the ability to see it There are other pictures of Cubans Here is a picture of a group of individuals who in fact are part of an effort to create a library system something as fundamental in the United States as a free public library There isnt that in Cuba at least not a free public library They control what books might be found there So these groups try to create information One of the things they do is again to be able to have accessas shown in this picture This is a panel that is talking on Television Marti Here in this picture is a young child watching a Marti program inside of Cuba You can see the logo here of Marti TV As shown in this picture this was a special that was broadcast into Cuba and was seen in Cuba on the Reverend Dr Martin Luther King on the whole issue of peaceful nonviolent changeas a message to the Cuban people that in fact these things could be achieved Now you can see at the bottom of these picturesit is a little hard to seebut here is the Marti logo that is seen on the bottom right hand corner on several of these photographs This came from that Government Accountability Office report A January 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office noted the following The Broadcasting Board of Governorswhich is the oversight we have as the Federal Governmentand the Office of Cuba Broadcasting and the US Interests Section in Havanawhich in essence is we do not have an Embassy there because we do not have relations but we have an Interests Section therethat Cuba officials emphasized that they face significant challenges in conducting valid audience research due to the closed nature of Cuban society US government officials stationed in Havana are prohibited by the Castro regime from traveling outside of Havana We know it is difficult to travel to Cuba for the purpose of conducting audience research We know the threat of Cuban Government surveillance and reprisals for interviewers and respondents raises concerns about respondents willingness to answer sensitive questions frankly In this January 2009 Government Accountability Report US officials indicated that research on Radio and TV Martis audience size faces significant limitations For example none of the data is representative of the entire Cuban population Telephone surveys are the only random data collection effort in Cuba but it might not be representative of Cubas media habits for several reasons But here are two of the main ones First only adults in homes with published telephone numbers are surveyed According to Broadcasting Board of Governors documents approximately 17 percent of Cuban adults live in households with published household numbers That means that 83 percent of the population does not have a published telephone number Second the Board of Governors and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting officials noted that because individuals in Cuba are discouraged or prohibited by their government from listening to and watching US international broadcasts they might be fearful of responding to media surveys and disclosing their media habits If I am told that it is illegal for me simply to watch the programming of some international organization and that I can go to jail for listening to that programming then ultimatelythen ultimatelyam I going to be truthful to some telephone survey about Did I watch TV Marti Did I listen to Radio Marti Mr President I know about this personally Years ago when I was in the House of Representatives while I had an aunt who was still alive at the time who I had asked never to acknowledge me as her nephew which she agreed toin my second term however she was listening to me on Radio Marti and in a moment of pride she said Oh that Menendez is my nephew Unfortunately she said it in front of some visitors who she thought were her friends One of them was part of El Comite de Defensa de la Revolucion which means The Committee to Defend the Revolution a block watch organization in every city in every village in every hamlet inside Cuba whose only job is to go and spy on their neighbors and tell the state security who speaks ill or does something against the regime Unfortunately for that simple act of speaking out saying to a friend Oh that Menendez is my nephew my aunt suffered serious consequences So the audience size might very well be larger than the survey results would indicate because people are fearful to say Yes I am listening to Radio and Television Marti because I cannot do that and not face the consequences of a regime that would arrest me Radio and TV Marti have a larger audience in Cuba Why do I say that Because a 2007 survey that the Office of Cuba Broadcasting commissioned intended to obtain information on programming preferences and media habits also contained data on Radio and TV Martis audience size While the survey was not intended to measure listening rates or project audience size this nonrandom survey of 382 Cubans who had recently arrived in the United Statesso now they were free to say what they actually did back at home because they were not subject to being arrested simply for listening to Radio and Television Marti found that 45 percent of all of those respondents reported listening to Radio Marti and that over 21 percent reported watching TV Marti within the last 6 months before leaving Cuba So I rise because I want to bring this data this information this perspective to the debate I am happy to see the very deep cuts that were made to the Office of Cuba Broadcasting that contains both Radio and Television Marti have largely been restored That is one of the reasons I felt willing to vote to proceed with the omnibus bill One of the bodys greatest strengths is the ability to freely debate issues in an open format issues on which in the end we might completely disagree but issues that need to be brought into clear focus for the American people However when I see my colleagues drawing conclusions on their own without reasonable data to support those conclusions I feel compelled to come and present an alternative perspective of the facts Why is this important to us The United States is a beacon of light of freedom and democracy around the world The promotion of democracy and human rights has always been one of the pillars of our foreign policy Yesterday was Human Rights Day which is the day that marks the anniversary of the United Nations Assemblys adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 It is recognized every year on December 10 Yesterday in the midst of the recognition of this day in Havana we saw the brutal Castro regime cracking down on people just because they were trying to exercise their right for peaceful demonstration We saw people beaten arrested and forcibly detained There is a group of ladies they call themselves the Ladies in White They are mothers and sisters and friends of jailed dissidents inside of Cuba So these are people of imprisoned family memberstheir son or their daughter their brother or sister their friendsand the only reason those people are in jail is because they have pursued peaceful means to try to create change inside of their own country They may have said something They may have worn a white band that says cambio which means change They may have simply uttered the fact that What we need is change inside of Cuba So these Ladies in Whitethey dress fully in white so that in fact it is a form of being noticed but again a peaceful formheld long stem flowers and miniature Cuban flags They were attacked by hundreds of angry progovernment demonstrators who sought to drown out their chants of freedom by yelling this street belongs to Fidel Now in Cuba these groups are not spontaneous It is not the citizenry It is something called rapid response brigades They are state security dressed as civilians whose purpose is to make it seem that the populous is against the human rights activists and political dissidents But ultimately they are state security agents who act in a way to make it seem quite different But they are thugs Mr President the reason the regime organizes protests in this way is so if you orchestrate a protest where it looks like its citizens are protesting against each other then the regime can deny in fact any role in the event However we know very well the role the Castro regime plays in these demonstrations Especially in light of the events of yesterday and today we know the Castro regime is a brutal totalitarian dictatorship that continues to violate the most basic human rights continues to crush debate and crush dialog Yesterday I came to the floor as part of my concerns and I spoke about this gentleman and his wife as shown in this picture I spoke about Jorge Luis Garcia Perez Antunez This is a gentleman who said while standing in a plaza in his hometown which is in the center of Havanait is not where the tourists go not on the beaches of Havana it is in the heart of Havanahe said what we need is the type of change we saw in Eastern Europe For that simple statement he was thrown into jail for 17 years17 years He came out a couple years ago but he has not changed He has not changed his views or his effort to create human rights He issued a public letter that I read yesterday an English translation of a public letter he wrote to the present dictator Raul Castro the brother of Fidel Castro and he said many things I am not going to read the whole letter again but he said things like Let me ask you a few questions that I think are important With what right do the authorities without a prior crime being committed detain and impede the free movement of their citizens in violation of a universally recognized right The very rights that are being observed in that international Human Rights Day of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights What feelings could move a man like Captain Idel Gonzalez Morfi to beat my wife a defenseless woman so brutally causing lasting effects to her bones for the sole act of arriving at a radio station to denounce with evidence the torture that her brother Her brother this is his wife shown in the picture received in a Cuban prison I spoke about him yesterday and his letter What happened today Mr President Today the day after Human Rights Day and the day after I read his letter into the Record and 2 days after he presented that letter to Raul Castro he was arrested again by the regime and arbitrarily detained with his wife and another activist What is his crime That I read a letter in the US Senate about his calls for freedom and democracy And the day after the recognition of international human rights he gets arrested today and his wife gets arrested todayor detained today I am not sure He got arrested for sure TV Marti is one of the many efforts the US Government rightly invests in to try to reach the Cuban people with information to try to reach the people who were beaten today and yesterday and for decades simply for trying to demonstrate peacefully to speak their mind to walk in peace and in remembrance of their loved ones they lost under the clenched fists of this regime I feel badly that the day after I spoke about Mr Antunez he ends up in jail So we need to have a spotlight just as we did for Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in the Soviet Union just as we did for Vaclav Havel as he was trying to create change for the Czech Republic just as we did with Lech Walesa when he was having the Solidarnosc Movement inside Poland For some reason I cant get anybody to come to this floor and talk about the human rights violations inside Cuba I hear a lot about Lets trade with Cuba lets do business with Cuba lets travel to Cuba but God I never hear anyone talking about these human rights activists like the Lech Walesas the Vaclav Havels the Aleksandr Solzhenitsyns of that other time This man got arrested today simply because yesterday we made his letter public That is the Castro regime that I know not the romanticism of what some people have about what goes on at that island So I am pleased the Office of Cuba Broadcasting has made efforts over the last year to reevaluate the programs they are carrying out and carefully consider creative ways to reach the Cuban people They have done this with Television Marti They will continue to do this with other programs I would expect nothing less The kind of evaluation should continue We should constantly strive to tailor our programs so our investments are reaching those who truly need our help investments that are advancing US foreign policy interests the national interests of the United States and the national security interests of the United States I have a declaration that came out of Cuba of over 100 human rights activists inside Cuba who are in support of the efforts of the United States as it relates to the surrogate broadcasting that goes into Cuba from Radio and Television Marti This broadcasting provides some free flow of information of what is happening in the rest of the world as well as what is happening inside Cuba Because that is part of what we help here to let those who otherwise would not know because of a closed society and a dictatorship that rules with an iron fist what is happening even inside their own country what is happening to people such as Mr Antunez what is happening to the ladies in white who are protesting peacefully about their loved ones in jail With that letter of over 100 human rights activists is the recognition that we will not let up for Mr Antunez and the recognition that there are voices who will continue to speak out for the human rights The last point I wish to make imagine if you were sitting in a gulag somewhere if you were beaten simply because you had a few words to say about creating change peacefully in your own country imagine if you could be swept away by security police and taken to some jail and maybe not seen for years after that Would you not want someone somewhere in the world to be standing and speaking for you I would and that is what I try to do on this floor With that I yield the floor President I ask unanimous consent that after any leader remarks on Saturday December 12 the Senate then resume consideration of the conference report to accompany HR 3288 and that at 930 am the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the conference report with the time until 930 am equally divided and controlled between the

unanimous consent that following the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Nevada Senator Ensign the Senate adjourn under the previous order 
S_WI_FEINGOLD,2009-12-11,1993_2009; 1993_2009; 1993_2009,0146; 0147; 0148, President the massive unamendable spending bill before the Senate includes three bills that the Senate never had a chance to consider and is chockfull of earmarks At a time of record budget deficits we should be showing our constituents that we are serious about fiscal responsibility Instead of controlling spending this bill represents business as usual in Congress Mr DeMINT Mr President I rise today to address a question submitted to me from the good Senator from Illinois as to whether the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program will in fact end after this year In order to respond to my colleague I would like to highlight a particular section of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act of 2010 that funds the District of Columbias budget In title IV which explains how the District of Columbia is funded it states that 132 million will indeed be provided for opportunity scholarships for existing students in the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program However the very next line clearly states that the funds are to remain available until expended which means that the program will eventually be phased out and terminated once the funding for current students is exhausted Students in the program will slowly be phased out over time unable to avail themselves of future educational opportunities currently given to them through this program The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program which has the overwhelming support of DC residents parents Mayor Adrian Fenty Chancellor Michelle Rhee former Mayor Anthony Williams and a majority of the DC City Council has now been mandated a slow death by House and Senate appropriators This scholarship program which gives students of Washington DCs poorest families a chance at a quality education has now effectively been terminated since there is only funding available for existing scholarships and existing students and not for future scholarships and future students By funding this program in such a manner in the omnibus Congress is ultimately signaling the beginning of the end for this scholarship program By disallowing future students to take part the size of the program will shrink year after year and will deny entry to siblings of existing participantspunishing many who have been waiting in line for this tremendous opportunity Additionally the federal evaluation of this program will be compromised as the numbers of participants diminishes making it difficult for administrators to evaluate the effectiveness of the program The fact that this administration continues to claim that the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program is not being terminated is yet another act of deception on their part to the American people The President who himself is a recipient of a K12 educational scholarship has refused to stand up for children in our Nations Capital and fight for the same educational opportunities afforded to him and his familya right he exercises now as he practices school choice with his own children President last month the United Nations Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo presented its latest report to the UN Security Council Over the years the Group of Experts has conducted critical investigations into violations of the sanctions and the UN arms embargo toward Congo as well as human rights abuses and the linkages between natural resource exploitation and the financing of illegal armed groups Yet too often the Group of Experts reports and recommendations have not resulted in action by the Security Council andor UN member states I hope it will be different with this report especially since it identifies a number of concrete steps through which UN member states can address the financial and support networks that fuel the violence in eastern Congo This new Group of Experts report particularly focuses on the FDLR the armed group comprising many former Rwandan genocidaires that is at the heart of the instability in eastern Congo It documents how this group continues to benefit from residual but significant support from top commanders of the Congolese military It also documents how this group is supported by a farreaching international Diaspora network Based on records of satellite phones the Group of Experts found that the FDLR commanders frequently communicate with people in twentyfive different countries in Europe North America and Africa The report also mentions credible reports and testimony that the FDLR is using Burundi as a rear base for regrouping and recruitment purposes To address these continued support networks the Group of Experts recommends that UN member states direct their respective law enforcement and security agencies to conduct investigations and share relevant information on FDLR Diaspora members providing material support to the group The Group also calls on member states to prosecute violations of the sanctions regime by their nationals or leaders of armed groups that are currently residing within their countries The report cites three such leaders who have resided in France and Germany With regard to the Congolese military the Group recommends that the Security Council require member states to notify and get approval from the Sanctions Committee for all deliveries of military equipment and provision of training to Congo This would help ensure that international assistance is not contributing to abusive behavior or going to units of the military believed to be colluding with armed groups Building on its previous reports the Group of Experts report also shows how the FDLR and other armed groups continue to benefit from the exploitation of natural resources According to this Groups investigations the FDLR continues to get millions of dollars in direct financing from gold and cassiterite reserves in eastern Congo The report illustrates how gold from eastern Congo is smuggled out to Uganda and Burundi and then travels on to the United Arab Emirates and ultimately international markets Similarly the report documents how former rebels of the CNDPwho have ostensibly become part of the Congolese militarycontinue to control and exploit mineralrich areas In fact two of the most lucrative mining sites are reportedly controlled by units of the Congolese military that are composed almost exclusively of former CNDP units This is especially worrying in the context of the CNDPs integration into the Congolese military which is still extremely fragile I have long called for action to address the armed exploitation of Congos minerals which fuels this conflict I was pleased to join with Senators Brownback and Durbin earlier this year to introduce the Congo Conflict Minerals Act S 891 which would commit the United States to address this issue comprehensively And I was glad that Secretary Clinton spoke about this issue during her visit to Congo in August As the Group of Experts report makes clear armed groups will continue to exploit the regions rich mineral base as long as it is profitable The Group of Experts recommends that member states take necessary measures to clarify the due diligence obligations of companies under their respective jurisdictions that operate with these minerals The Group also calls for the Congolese government to establish an independent monitoring team with international support to conduct spot checks of mines and mineral trading routes I am glad that there is increasing outrage about what is happening in eastern Congo It is the single deadliest conflict since the Second World War and millions have been displaced from their homes forced to live in squalid conditions Countless women and girls and some men and boys in the Congo have endured rape and sexual violence But our outrage means little unless it translates into concrete actions to fundamentally change the situation in Congo We need to finally get serious about addressing the underlying issues that make this war profitable and allow it to persist The Group of Experts has provided a clear picture of some of those issues as well as specific ways that UN member states can address them including within our own national jurisdictions I applaud the Group for its courageous work I strongly hope that the Security Council will pursue the reports recommendations and I urge the Obama administration to lead the way in this respect President our government agencies collect and report a range of economic information but much of what we see or hear is most suited to describing the general state of the countrys economy This information does not reflect what is happening in and what matters most to our families and the quality of our lives For example our national unemployment figures dont tell us that those who are employed may not have benefits or that they are working two or three jobs to earn the income that they report or that their mortgage debt and college loans are jeopardizing their ability to repay their credit card debt or their medical bills By knowing and reporting this kind of information we can not only more accurately reflect what our families are experiencing economically we can better inform policymakers about what matters most to people and the steps that need to be taken to address household economic needs and concerns To address this need I am reintroducing the Commission on Measures of Household Economic Security Act of 2009 The bill would establish a bipartisan congressional commission of 8 economic experts to look at existing government economic data and identify the possible need for new information more accurate methodologies and better ways to report these economic measures to give a more accurate and reliable picture of the economic well being of American households As part of their effort the Commission will be asked to meet with representative groups of the public so that their views are taken into account in the Commissions recommendations In doing this the Commission will look at such things as the current debt situation of American individuals and households including categories of debt such as credit card debt education related loans and mortgage payments the movement of Americans between salaried jobs with benefits to single or multiple wage jobs with limited or no benefits with a comparison of income to include the value of benefits programs such as health insurance and retirement plans the percentage of Americans who are covered by both employerprovided and individual health care plans and the extent of coverage per dollar paid by both employers and employees the savings rate including both standard savings plans and pension plans the disparity in income distribution over time and between different demographic and geographic groups and the breakdown of household expenditures between such categories as food shelter medical expenses debt servicing and energy In addition the Commission will consider the relevance of certain nonmarket activities like household production education and volunteer services that affect the economic wellbeing of households but are not measured or valued in currently reported economic statistics As Robert F Kennedy famously said some of our economic indicators measure everything in short except that which makes life worthwhile We need to make an effort to value more than just our gross domestic product and sales receipts We need to better measure and understand what matters to American households This effort to improve how we measure what matters in our economy is very much in the Wisconsin tradition of accountable good government It was Senator Robert LaFollette Jr who in 1932 introduced a resolution requiring the US Government to establish a more scientific specific and accurate set of measures of the health of the US economy From his request Simon Kuznets a University of Pennsylvania economics professor developed the first set of national accounts which form the basis for todays measure of GDP and other economic indicators Kuznets won the 1971 Nobel Prize in Economics for his empirically founded interpretation of economic growth which has led to new and deepened insight into the economic and social structure and process of development His work was the basis for much of the New Deal reform policies Yet Kuznets specifically acknowledged that his measures were incomplete and did not go far enough to measure what may really matter In his 1934 report to the Senate on his compilation of statistics associated with Gross National Product he concluded The welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as so defined This bill is intended to advance these earlier efforts to make our economic statistical measures more reflective of the welfare of our families and our nation The cost of this commission will be fully covered by amounts already authorized and appropriated to the Bureau of Labor Statistics I urge my colleagues to support my legislation By Ms CANTWELL for herself and Ms Collins S 2877 A bill to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a program to regulate the entry of fossil carbon into commerce in the United States to promote clean energy jobs and economic growth and avoid dangerous interference with the climate of the Earth and for other purposes to the Committee on Finance 
S_SD_JOHNSON,2009-12-11,1997_2009,0047, President working families are struggling to pay the costs of health care in this country As the debate over health care reform progresses we must keep in mind that Americans need and deserve quality affordable health care All too often families learn that the plan they could afford was not adequate when they needed it most I recently heard from Cory and Erin in Lake Herman SD They shared the story of their daughters birth and how they discovered the inadequacies of their seemingly affordable health insurance policy When Cory and Erins daughter Katarzyna was born in 2006 Cory was working as an English and math teacher At the time the family health insurance plan available to him through the school district cost nearly 50 percent of his monthly salary Cory chose instead to buy a catastrophic highdeductible policy on the individual market for just over 10 percent of his income Cory and Erin were healthy adults and had no major medical issues until the birth of their daughter Their insurance policy did not cover prenatal or maternity care Wanting to be smart health care consumers Cory and Erin shopped around for the best and most affordable hospital to welcome the birth of their first child and decided on their nearby community hospitial However when Katarzyna was born she had a lung infection that required immediate action Exhausted and worried for the health of their new baby girl Cory and Erin had only moments to decide whether to airlift Katarzyna to a hospital with specialized care At that moment the last thing they could think about was the cost Katarzyna spent 3 nights in the Natal Intensive Care Unit of one of the States largest hospitals where she received topnotch care and survived the nearfatal pneumonia The total cost came to 24000 of which Cory and Erins highdeductible insurance policy covered only 12000 For the next several months the family faced not only the challenges of a new baby but significant debt and a drawnout struggle with their insurance company They found a mistake with nearly every bill they received Since this experience Cory and Erin have purchased a new policy but worry that the insurance they can afford is not adequate in the face of another unforeseen medical emergency Like many Americans Cory and Erin have health insurance Despite their limited income they took the responsibility to buy their own policy and tried to be smart health care consumers Their experience however illustrates the vulnerability of Americans who purchase insurance on the individual market as well as the limits to which it is possible for Americans to be informed health care consumers The health care market does not function like other consumer markets Ask your neighbor what a gallon of milk costs and they could tell you Ask them how much it costs to have a baby and you would likely get a variety of answers based entirely on their own experience with this important life event The fact is the cost of having a baby depends It depends on how much you pay for health insurance what your insurance policy will cover and how much of that cost is your share It depends on where you live what complications may arise and whether the hospital nearby is equipped to handle an emergency The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will guarantee families access to affordable health insurance and coverage for essential benefits including prenatal and maternity care New health insurance exchanges in every State will provide a menu of quality affordable health insurance plans for the selfemployed and those who cant afford the coverage offered by their employer Families who need assistance will be eligible for tax credits to make the plan of their choice affordable Most importantly families like Cory Erin and Katarzynas will have health insurance that covers lifes essential needs The birth of a child should not be a time to worry about what your health insurance will pay for or whether you can afford the treatment you need Health care reform will give American families one less thing to worry about with the security of quality affordable health care 
S_AK_BEGICH,2009-12-03,2009_2009,0048, President I want to comment today on the confirmation earlier this week of the Honorable Jacqueline Nguyen to be judge on the US District Court for the Central District of California Unfortunately I was delayed in my return from Alaska and I was unable to be here for the vote Had I been here I would have proudly cast my vote along with the rest of my Senate colleagues to confirm this highly qualified and wellrespected jurist Upon her confirmation Judge Nguyen made history by becoming the first VietnameseAmerican to serve as a US district court judge in US history I applaud the judges unanimous confirmation by the Senate as an example of what we do all too infrequently I am afraidrecognizing a public need and to acting appropriately and expeditiously to address it I commend the President for heeding the recommendation by our colleagues from California and nominating a woman of obvious talent The President nominated Judge Nguyen I am sure because he perceived in her a combination of the education experience and temperament appropriate for a lifetenured position on the federal bench Her unanimous well qualified rating from the American Bar Associations Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary earned after an 18year career in the law including nearly 7 years as a California Superior Court judge and roughly the same amount of time as an assistant US attorney in the same district in which she will now serve as a Federal judge would seem to be completely justified I have little doubt that Judge Nguyen will be an outstanding Federal judge As impressed as we all should be with her qualifications I believe we can all look at the details of Judge Nguyens life as a truly great and quintessential American story Born in Da Lat Vietnam Judge Nguyen and her family were able to escape the approaching North Vietnamese and Viet Cong armies departing Saigon in 1975 on a crowded helicopter as gunfire could be heard in the background The Nguyen family was part of the great wave of Vietnamese immigrants who left their homeland to escape the Communist takeover After stops in refugee camps in the Philippines and on Guam the Nguyens made their way to California spending several months living in a tent on the grounds of the Marine base at Camp Pendleton The Nguyens eventually settled in La Crescenta The judge her siblings and their mother cleaned dental offices after school and at night while her father studied to be a computer programmer and worked in a gas station at night and on weekends Eventually her parents purchased a doughnut shop in North Hollywood Judge Nguyen says she often did her homework during high school between shifts at the doughnut shop and also worked there while she was earning her degree from Occidental College She would ultimately earn her law degree from UCLA I do not know Judge Nguyen but I am impressed by her accomplishments and the drive she and her family have shown in coming to this country and embracing the opportunities the United States offers it citizens I recognize in her story the same drive and love of country that I have seen among the VietnameseAmerican citizens of Alaska The United States is a nation made great in part by its diversity I personally take pride in serving alongside our first AfricanAmerican President and at the same time as our first VietnameseAmerican Federal judge Still as much as the confirmation of this highly qualified woman is an example of the possibilities available to all Americans I cannot help but believe it is being hailed today as a point of immense pride by the VietnameseAmerican community in my home State of Alaska in Judge Nguyens State of California and all across this country I extend the judge and the VietnameseAmerican community my sincere congratulations

this afternoon on drug reimportation These votes mean that today is the day we can show the American people whether we can pass drug importation or whether the Senate will give it lipservice and nothing else We have heard on the Senate floor the concerns that some have about drug importation and whether it can be safe Everyone who knows me knows I care deeply about drug safety The fact is an unsafe situation is what we have today Today consumers are ordering drugs over the Internet from who knows where and the FDA does not have the resources in fact to do much of anything about it The fact is legislation to legalize importation would not only help to lower the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans but also should shut down the unregulated importation of drugs from foreign pharmacies the situation we have today The Dorgan amendment in fact would improve drug safety not threaten it It would open trade to lower cost drugs In 2004 my staff was briefed about an investigation that the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee conducted That subcommittee conducted this investigation into what we would call going on right now current drug importation They found about 40000 parcels containing prescription drugs come through the JFK mail facility every single day of the year 40000 packages each day Now the JFK airport houses the largest international mail branch in the United States but even then that is the tip of the iceberg According to this subcommittee each day 30000 packages of drugs enter the US through Miami 20000 enter through Chicago That is another 50000 more packages each and every day What is worse about 28 percent of the drugs coming in are controlled substances So we have a situation where we need the basic approach in this amendment to assure that imported drugs are safe That is what the Dorgan amendment is all about to give FDA the ability to verify the drug pedigree back to the manufacturer to require FDA to inspect frequently and to require fees to give the FDA the resources to do that The bottom line is the Dorgan amendment gives the FDA the authority and the resources it needs to implement drug importation safely Certainly the President knows that a great way to hold drug companies accountable is to allow safe legal drug importation I would like to quote this President not when he was a candidate for President but a candidate for the Senate This is what President Obama said then I urge my opponent to stop siding with the drug manufacturers and put aside his opposition to the reimportation of lower priced prescription drugs Now we are hearing about the secret deal with big PhRMA That was revised just this week to solidify support with PhRMAs allies for killing this very important Dorgan amendment The drug companies will stop at nothing to keep the United States closed to other markets in order to charge higher prices With the Dorgan amendment we are working to get the job done What we need is to make sure Americans have even greater more affordable access to wonder drugs by further opening the doors to competition in the global pharmaceutical industry Americans are waiting Too often this thing has been stymied and it looks like there is another chance to stymie it Only I am surprised Most of the time in the past that I have been for the importation of drugs it was my colleagues over here who were trying to stymie it But now it looks as though it is the other side We ought to have a vast majority for this amendment I would be surprised It would be a crime if we didnt I yield the floor I thank my good friend for doing that I have a little different view on some of the things he said about taxes here I respect him giving me some time because we dont have time on this side It is nice his doing that Republicans and Democrats are working off of the same data provided by the Joint Committee on Taxation For some reason my friends on the other side of the aisle seem to want to read this data selectively so I wish to look at this data I want to stress this data is from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation They are experts They are nonpolitical people who tell it like it is My friends on the other side are correct in one thing This bill provides a tax benefit to a small group of Americans You can see right here that this benefit is to the people here where the minus sign is in front of the numbers These numbers are in white As I pointed out previously when you see a negative number on this chart the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us these people are receiving a tax benefit This income categorythe income categories where you see these negative numbers begin at zero and stretch to 50000 for individuals and 75000 for families That will be 50000 to 75000 I give my Democratic friends credit for being right on this part of the data But I want to show you where I disagree with them and their choosing to overlook other parts of the data the data I will soon refer to here on this chart When we see negative numbers on this chart as I have said the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us that there is a tax benefit So conversely where there are positive numbersthis will be an example of positive numbersthe Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us these taxpayers are seeing a tax increase Those numbers I have already pointed to begin at 50000 for an individual and go up to 200000 for an individual When we see a positive number then it is the reverse The Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us these taxpayers are in fact seeing tax increases So if we see positive numbers for individuals making more than 50000 and we see positive numbers for families making more than 75000 it is just this simple We know these peoples taxes are going to go up The Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us that taxes for these individuals once again for a third time will go up under this 2074 page Reid bill These individuals and families are making less than 200000 What is significant about less than 200000 is that this violates what the President promised in his campaign that individuals who are middle class under 200000 are not going to see one dime of tax increase To come to any different conclusion is saying that the data on this chartand of course the professionals at the Joint Committee on Taxationboth are wrong To come to any different conclusion is saying the chart produced by the Joint Committee on Taxation is wrong I yield the floor President yesterday afternoon a few of my friends on the other side made some assertions about congressional history fiscal policy and the role of bipartisan tax relief for the period of 20012006 The speakers were the distinguished junior Senators from Vermont Ohio and Minnesota They are all passionate Members They are articulate voices of the progressive as they term it or very liberal wing as those of us on this side term it portion of the Senate Democratic Caucus I respect the passion they bring to their views But as one of them has said frequently in his early months of Senate service we are entitled to our opinions but not entitled to our own facts I couldnt agree more with that notion In order to insure an intellectually honest standard of debate both sides need to correct the record when they feel the other side has misstated the facts It is in that spirit that I respond today I wont take this time to debate the merits of the surtax that they propose as a substitute revenue raiser in this bill That can wait till we debate their amendment I am going to focus on their assertions about recent fiscal history and the role of bipartisan tax relief Before I address the revisionist fiscal history we heard I would like to set the record straight on congressional history It was said yesterday afternoon that there were 8 years of a George W Bush administration and Republican Congress If the Members making these assertions would go back and check the records of the Senate they would find that during that 8year period Republicans controlled the Senate when it was evenly divided for a little over 5 months For almost half the month of January 2001 Democrats held the majority because outgoing Vice President Gore broke ties For the balance of the period from January 20 2001 through June 6 2001 the Senate was evenly divided but Republicans held because of Vice President Cheneys tie breaking vote On June 6 2001 the Democrats regained the majority when Senator Jeffords previously a Republican began caucusing with Senate Democrats For the balance of 2001 2002 and in early 2003 Democrats held the majority For two Congresses half of President Bushs term Republicans held a majority For the last 2 years of the George W Bush Presidency Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress When you add it up with the exception of a little over 4 months when the Senate was equally divided Democrats controlled the Senate for about half the period of the George W Bush administration When you hear some of our friends on the other side debate recent fiscal history these basic facts regarding political power and accountability are obscured Perhaps it is their opinion that Democrats were not exercising majority power during that period but the fact is that Democrats controlled the Senate for almost half the period of the George W bush administration Now lets turn to the fiscal history assertions from my friends on the other side The revisionist history basically boils down to two conclusions 1 That all of the bipartisan tax relief enacted during that period was skewed to the top 1 percent or top twotenths of 1 percent of taxpayers and 2 That all of the bad fiscal history of this decade to date is attributable to the bipartisan tax relief plans Not surprisingly nearly all of the revisionists who spoke generally oppose tax relief and support tax increases The same crew generally support spending increases and oppose spending cuts On the first point two of the three speakers from the other side voted for the conference report for fiscal year 2010 budget resolution The third speaker was not a Member of this body at that time the conference report was adopted I am not aware however of his opposition to that budget which was drawn up by the Senate Democratic Caucus That budget was similar to President Obamas first budget A core portion of that budget much ballyhooed by the Democratic leadership was an extension of the major portion of the bipartisan tax relief enacted during the period of 20012006 As a matter of fact roughly 80 percent of the revenue loss from that legislation much criticized by the three speakers yesterday afternoon is contained in the budget that two of them voted for Eighty percent is usually a pretty fair endorsement of any policy Again I have not heard the third speaker the junior Senator from Minnesota indicate that he doesnt support the tax relief included in the Democratic budget Perhaps I missed something In addition the three speakers need to pay attention to analyses from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation If they did examine those analyses they would find that in terms of the burden of taxation the 2001 legislation redistributed the burden from lower income taxpayers to higher income taxpayers Now I turn to the second fiscal revisionist history point That point is that all of the bad fiscal history of this decade to date is attributable to the bipartisan tax relief plans In the debate so far many on this side have pointed out some key undeniable facts We agree with the President on one key fact The President inherited a big deficit and a lot of debt The antirecessionary spending together with lower tax receipts and the TARP activities has set a fiscal table of a deficit of 12 trillion That was on the Presidents desk when he took over the Oval Office on January 20 2009 That is the highest deficit as a percentage of the economy in Post World War II history Not a pretty fiscal picture And as predicted several months ago that fiscal picture got a lot uglier with the 787 billion stimulus bill So for the folks who saw that bill as an opportunity to recover America with government taking a larger share of the economy over the long term I say congratulations For those who voted for the stimulus bill including two of the three speakers to which I refer they put us on the path to a bigger role for the government Over a trillion dollars of new deficit spending was hidden in that bill The Congressional Budget Office concluded that the permanent fiscal impact of that bill totaled over 25 trillion over 10 years It caused some of the extra red ink Supporters of that bill need to own up to the fiscal course they charted Now to be sure after the other side pushed through the stimulus bill and the second half of the 700 billion of TARP money CBO reestimated the baseline A portion of this new red ink upfront is due to that reestimate The bottom line however is that reestimate occurred several weeks after the President and robust Democratic majorities took over the government Decisions were made and the fiscal consequences followed Some on the other side who raises this point about the March CBO reestimate That is fine But if they were to be consistent and intellectually honest then they would have to acknowledge the CBO reestimate that occurred in 2001 after President Bush took office The surplus went south because of economic conditions The 56 trillion number so often quoted by those on the other side was illusory The three members should go back and take a look at what CBO said at the time According to CBO for the first relevant fiscal year the tax cut represented barely 14 percent of the total change in the budget For instance for the same period increased appropriations outranked the tax cut by 6 billion So spending above baseline together with lower projected revenues accounted for 86 percent of the change in the budget picture Let me repeat that Bipartisan tax relief was a minimal 14percent factor in the change in the budget situation Over the long term the tax cut was projected to account for 45 percent of the change in the budget picture Stated another way the 10year surplus declined from 56 trillion to 16 trillion Of that 40 trillion change the tax cut represented about 17 trillion of the decline Lets take a look at the fiscal history before the financial meltdown hit That conclusion is again in this decade all fiscal problems are attributable to the widespread tax relief enacted in 2001 2003 2004 and 2006 In 2001 President Bush came into office He inherited an economy that was careening downhill Investment started to go flat in 2000 The techfueled stock market bubble was bursting Then came the economic shocks of the 911 terrorist attacks Add in the corporate scandals to that economic environment And it is true as fiscal year 2001 came to close the projected surplus turned to a deficit I referred to the net effects of some of these unforeseen events on the projected 56 trillion surplus Now yesterday afternoons three speakers may so oppose bipartisan tax relief that they want to attribute all fiscal problems to the tax relief The official scorekeepers show the facts to be different Those on this side of the aisle have a different view than the revisionists In just the right time the 2001 tax relief plan started to kick in The fiscal facts show as the tax relief hits its full force in 2003 the deficits grew smaller They grew smaller in amount They grew smaller as a percentage of the economy This pattern continued up through 2007 If my comments were meant to be partisan shots I could say this favorable fiscal path from 2003 to 2007 was the only period aside from 6 months in 2001 where Republicans controlled the White House and the Congress But unlike the fiscal history revisionists I am not trying to make any partisan points I am just trying to get to the fiscal facts So lets get the fiscal history right In this decade deficits went down after the tax relief plans were put in full effect Deficits did start to trend back up after the financial meltdown hit I doubt the fiscal history revisionists who spoke yesterday would say that bipartisan tax relief was the cause of the financial meltdown So aside from that unrelated bad macroeconomic development the trend line showed revenues on the way back up But that is the past We need to make sure we understand it But what is most important is the future People in our States send us here to deal with future policy This budget debate should not be about Democrats flogging Republicans and viceversa The people dont send us here to flog one another like partisan cartoon cutout characters over past policies They dont send us here to endlessly point fingers of blame Now lets focus on the fiscal consequences of the budget that is before the Senate President Obama rightly focused us on the future with his eloquence during the campaign Id like to take a quote from the Presidents nomination acceptance speech We need a President who can face the threats of the future not grasping at the ideas of the past President Obama was right We need a President and I would add Congressmen and Senators who can face the threats of the future The legislation before us as currently written poses considerable threats to our fiscal future It is too important to dodge It is a bill that restructures onesixth of the economy It affects all of us and more importantly all of our constituents Grasping at ideas of the past or playing the partisan blame game will not deal with the threats to our fiscal future Lets face the honest fiscal facts Lets not revise fiscal history as we start this critical debate about the fiscal choices ahead of us The people who send us here have a right to expect nothing less of us 
S_AL_SESSIONS,2009-12-17,1997_2009; 1997_2009,0222; 0223, Reserving the right to object if I might if the Senator would propose her request again Madam President it is very distressing that Senator Stabenow could not finish her remarks and that other Senators such as Senator Whitehouse and Senator Levin and Senator Lieberman have been shorted of time Why Because for some reason the majority leader feels we should not go past 530 tonight This is a defense bill and it is important We need to be talking about the good things that are in it and the things that have been added to it that are not so good I do not think working a few extra hours is going to hurt anybody I hear colleagues complain that they cannot work a weekend they cannot work up to Christmas they cannot work at night Well what about our men and women who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan 7 days a week 12 hours a day Christmas and holidays They are away from their families so I do not have any sympathy for any Member of the Senate who feels this is too hard for them Also I do not appreciate the fact that we are shut off from debate tonight to be able to talk about this issue that is before us I see no reason for that to have to occur I object to the health care bill The American people object to the health care billsixtyone percent say no But we are supposed to now agree and go along with the majority And if we do not we are some sort of obstructionists I do not think so I believe I am representing my constituency I believe I am representing the best interests of the United States of America I do not believe this health care bill is part of that With regard to the armed services billI am a member of the Armed Services Committee and I have been a Member for 12 years I have been to Iraq six times and Afghanistan six timesI believe it is great we can give our soldiers a pay raise and support them A lot of things in the bill are good There are some that are cut too much but there are a lot of things that are good and I wish to vote for the bill But this defense bill has 18 billion in unrelated spending items attached it increased unemployment COBRA food stamps and loan subsidies for businesses Two things strike me about this First these new expenditures are not paid for They are not within the budget They are above the budget What does that mean Well the budget itself has us in deficit So if it is not paid for in the budget resolution every penny of this 18 billion goes straight to the debt of the United States of America We need to stop this Second why did they put this kind of spending on the defense bill Because they want to come down here and say Anybody who is not willing to go along with this scheme to pad 18 billion straight to the debt of the United States of Americaanybody who objects does not love our soldiers That is wrong and people are getting tired of that This is how the debt of this country is surging out of control This Congress is irresponsible in our spending We have increased the debt the likes of which this Nation has never seen and we are spending as if it is going out of style I would point out one matter here about the interest we pay on the debt In 2008 the annual deficit was 450 billionat that time the largest ever This past year the deficit for the fiscal year ending September 30 was 1400 billion 14 trillion This puts us on the map according to the Congressional Budget Office to double the entire debt of America in 5 years and triple it in 10 Unbelievable This is a kind of gimmickattaching unpaid for nonbudgeted items to the defense bill then trying to force it through so we cannot do anything about it They snicker I am sure in their selfconfident way that We got em If they object to the bill we will say they dont love our soldiers they dont support Americas defense I am getting tired of it I think the American people are getting tired of it I saw a poll where the most popular party in America today is the tea partymore than Republicans or Democrats Somebody said Well 18 billion Sessions that is not too much money But it is done on bill after bill This is not the only bill that has these kinds of gimmicks in it Let me show you I figured this out one day I put together a chart here a little bit hastily Baseline Increases A Destructive Pattern When we increase funding in these bills above the budgeted amount and increase the debt people like to think Well it is just 18 billion That is not much Look how that works when you do it over a period of ten years So lets say next year we go over 18 billion This adds another 18 billion to the national debt Well that is not so much But wait it is a lot The State of Alabamas general fund budget is 2 billion Do not tell me 18 billion in one bill on top of this defense bill is not a lot of money It is a huge amount of money But it does not work that way This 18 billion tends to go into the baseline so the next year when they talk about increasing the budget they pad it by another 18 billion It is not just 18 billion the next year you see It is 18 billion on top of what was pumped into the baseline the year before and that totals out to 36 billion Then the next year it is 36 billion plus 18 billion more And the next year it is 54 billion plus 18 billion more The next year it is 72 billion plus 18 billion The next year it is 90 billion plus 18 billion And the next years it is 108 billion 126 billion 144 billion and 162 billion if you pad the budget And this bill is just 1 of 13 accounts Defense We have 13 different spending bills How much is that It is 900 billion in additional deficits just because of our inability our unwillingness to stay by the numbers that we voted on as our budget limit The budget itself as presented by the President and passed by the Democratic majority put us on a road to having 14 trillion in deficit last year and it looks as though this year we are going to have a another 14 trillion deficit But just this one little gimmick if it is replicated each year can add almost 1 trillion more to the debt of America over ten years That is why we are concerned about it By the way when we talk about the scheme that puts us on the road according to the Congressional Budget Office to tripling the debt of America by 2019 that does not include the health care bill The health care bill has not passed This outlook only includes the things that are in law now So how much more would those figures be if the debt goes up I will point to one last thing about the overall financial status of this country the interest we pay on that debt This chart shows it Last year this Nation paid 170 billion in interest on the borrowings we have as a nation In that 1 year it was 170 billion That is a lot of money As I said not counting the State education budget for all the other matters of our State of 46 million people which is almost onefiftieth of the Nations population an average sized Stateour general fund is 2 billion However 170 billion is how much we paid in interest last year According to the Congressional Budget Office those numbers will increase to where in 2019 as a result of surging debt 799 billion will be added to our debt because of interest we must pay 799 billion just in that 1 year That is more than the whole defense budget That is more than the whole US discretionary budget from not too long ago That is a huge amount of money It is going to crowd out spending for schools for highways for health care and for other projects I am very upset about it We cannot continue The President has said this is an unsustainable course Every economist we talk to says it is an unsustainable course But how do we get there We get there by taking a Defense bill and tacking on 18 billion worth of unfunded spending Every penny of that gets added to the debt I urge my colleagues to send this bill back and reform it so we can have a clean Defense bill We need to take these unpaid matters out and make sure they are paid for I thank the Chair and yield the floor

apologize for not being immediately familiar with it Therefore I presume the assistant leader is going to remind me or at least reacquaint me with its terms I would note the term Ponzi Act did not come from me It came from the chairman of the Budget Committee Will the Senator yield for a question The Senator is absolutely right to point out the Bennet amendment is a shell game charade and a farce that there will still be 12 trillion in the first 10 years but actually 25 trillion over the period 2010 to 2029 to be cut out of Medicare Earlier the majority leader came to the floor and talked about a memo that I sent around which is a fairly innocuous memo to our fellow Members which outlined the rights to fellow Members relative to floor activity and I sent in my position as Budget ranking member because most of these issues are tied to the budget and the covering letter said we as a minority must use the tools we have under the Senate rules to insist on a full complete and fully informed debate on health care legislation as well as all legislation that comes before the Senate I ask the Republican leader is it not reasonable that we should have a full complete and fair debate on this health care bill If the Republican leader will yield further it is ironic is it not that the majority leader would come to the floor and complain about an innocuous statement that outlines the rules which Members of the Senate have a statement which I suspect he actually would pass out to his members for information were they in the minoritymaybe even in the majority because they would like to know how the rules work in the Senateafter the majority leader had completely subverted the rules of the Senate by not taking this 2074 page bill through committee so it could be amended in the open so it could be amended but rather writing it in the back room some closet around here with three or four Members of the Senate present Isnt there an ironic inconsistency to his outrage on the fact that we suggested people should know the rules here while he has basically tried to go around the rules I will ask one more question because I find the irony in the situation so unique A memo which outlines what the rights are of all Membersbut Members of the minority specifically because the rules are meant to protect the minority from the majority that is the tradition of our Government of course which seems to be an affront to the majority at this pointthat a memo of that nature which essentially says the minority has certain rights in order for the institution to function correctlyI am wondering why did we create these rules in the first place Wasnt it so we could continue the thought of Adams of Madison who suggested that the Senate should be the place where when legislation comes forward which has been rushed through the House the Senate should be the place where that legislation receives a deliberative view where it is explored as to its unintended consequences and as to its consequences generally and where the body has the opportunity to amend it effectively so it can be improved Isnt that the purpose of the Senate And isnt that what the rules of the Senate are designed to do to accomplish the goals of our Founding Fathers to have a Senate where the legislation is adequately aired and considered versus being rushed through in a precipitous way I suspect were the majority leader in the minority he would be insisting on exactly what the Republican leader is insisting ona fair and open debate which allows the minority to make its case as to the good points in this bill and as to the bad points The way you make that case is by following the rules of the Senate is that not correct If the Senator would allow me to comment on that one point I appreciate the proposal of the Senator from Rhode Island but I think it needs to be put in its proper context This is a sense of the Senate It has no legal implications The CLASS Act as proposed in the underlying bill was described by the Senator from Rhode Island but not fully The way the CLASS Act works it is an insurance program theoretically where people in their thirties and forties and fifties can buy insurance to cover their retirement years when they have to go into some sort of longterm care facility and may be institutionalized People are paying into this program for decades maybe four decades maybe their thirties right into their seventies or their twenties into their sixties The cost of this program does not actually start to be incurred until these folks move into a longterm care facility or a managed care facility type of situation for their retirement years where they need skilled nursing assistance of some sort There is a huge amount of premium that comes in under this program early which goes against virtually no expenses because this is a brandnew program It is a startup program It is created by the Federal Government It is a government insurance program much like Social Security and Medicare The practical effect of that is that money will come in for years to the Federal coffers In the first 10 years of this bill it is estimated around 90 billion will come in In the second as we move out in the second 10 years the total over those two periods of 10 years is about 212 billion Then more money will come in in the third 10 years probably somewhere in the vicinity of 300 billion to 400 billion potentially None of this will be spent on the purposes of this insurance because almost everybody who is paying in for these premiums is going to be too young to go into one of these institutionalized care facilities during those first three decades So what happens is that the Federal Government gets this large windfall of money from these people who are paying their premiums and spends it spends it on something elseeducation roads highways arts whatever is the decision on where to spend the money It gets spent That is the way the Federal Government works It doesnt have any place to put this money and keep it safe It comes in and it gets spent When these people retire when they do go into a situation where they need assisted living of some sort then the government gets the bill Not us not those of us who are here We will be long retired by then everybody in this Chamber except maybe Senator Bennet from Colorado who is rather young and vibrant The rest of us will probably not be around to take advantage of this It will be our children and grandchildren who will end up with that bill That bill will be staggering We are talking hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars of outyear costs as a result of this type of program much like Social Security which basically has nothing in the coffers today even though trillions of dollars have been paid in but which has a lot of obligations The same thing with Medicare That was an insurance program which was supposed to have money in the coffers Not there In fact it goes into negative cashflow and will be insolvent beginning in 2010 There is no money when these folks retire and need it It will have been spent This amendment well intentioned as a statement has absolutely no effect on that series of events That money will still be spent under this amendment After this amendment is passedand I presume it will be passed it is a nonevent amendment having no purpose other than a political statementCBO will still score this bill as spending that money absolutely score this bill as spending that money the 90 billion for the next 10 years the 212 billion for the next 20 years the 400 billion after that That is my guess The third 10year period my guess is 500 billion When we get out there 30 40 years from now and these people expect to get their insurance paid then when our children get the bill for that insurance it becomes a tax on them a direct tax on their earnings It will affect their lifestyle their earning capacity their ability to buy a home to send a child to college to buy a car This money will be spent under this bill One of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who is pretty respected around here on financial matters I believe referred to this CLASS Act proposal as a Ponzi scheme That is not too far off Basically we are taking the money from these folks who buy into this insurance program today We are spending it on something we want to spend it on as a Congress today whether it is something worthwhile such as a road or education or our national defense but we are spending it We are leaving the people who paid that premium out to lunch unless 30 or 40 years from now when they go into that situation where they need that insurance the country is strong enough and our kids are making enough money to pay for the cost of that program That is a real gamble for them and that is called a Ponzi scheme which is exactly what this is This bill this sense of the Senate although a good political document because it allows Members to wander around their districts and say I voted to protect the CLASS Act dollars I voted that it not be accounted for under this bill that was a sense of the Senate In actuality it has no effect at all in that area All the money that comes into this insurance money is going to be spent somewhere else And the CBO will still score this bill as taking credit for that insurance under this program It is Bernie Madoff accounting one more time under this bill You would think after a while people would get embarrassedreally it would become embarrassing after a while When you match up 10 years of tax increases 10 years of Medicare cuts to 5 years of programmatic spending and claim you have a program that is fully paid for and is only an 840 billion program when you know that if the program the entire bill is fully phased in it is 25 trillion in cost It isnt 500 billion in Medicare cuts when this thing is fully phased in it is 1 trillion in Medicare cuts It isnt 500 billion of tax increases in this bill and fee increases on small businesses mostly or on provider groups it is over 1 trillion of increases You would think after a while people would be embarrassed about the manipulation of numbers in that way But that doesnt seem to occur Yet we get this proposal that says OK lets do it again Lets claim we are doing something we are not doing Lets claim we are protecting the dollars that come in under this new CLASS Act proposal assuming this program goes into place Lets claim we are segregating them somehow so the people who pay their hardearned dollars and buy into this CLASS Act think they are getting something for it when in fact that will not happen at all is not going to happen at all That money is going to be spent the day it comes in In fact it is already spent We are already borrowing so much and spending so much in this government right now We already have an obligation of debt that will spend this money I guess everybody can walk away feeling good about this amendment but substantively it has no impact at all The Senator has asked a very pointed and appropriate question because the answer is pretty startling The point I think most people dont understand is that this money gets spent as it comes in In other words lets say over the next 30 years younger people pay into this new alleged insurance program accurately described as a Ponzi scheme All that money that comes in will be spent on other activities of the government and therefore the other activities of government will be allowed to grow fairly dramatically There will be a lot of money here You are talking potentially 1 trillion over the next 30 years Those expenditures which will have occurred as a result of this money coming in which will have nothing at all to do with paying for the cost of the health care which these people who buy into this CLASS Act think they are gettingin other words longterm care insurance it has nothing to do with thatit will be on as I said education roads national defense whatever we spend it on around here Those expenditures will be built into the baseline forever They will presume that there is going to be revenue to pay for them What happens when that generation that has bought into the CLASS Act starts to actually need the money it is alleged it is going to get Two things happen The younger generation is going to have to pay taxes to cover that cost because the money will not be there There will be no money in the kitty none zero There will be zero money in the kitty the alleged kitty to pay for this insurance program Second ironically the government will have been grown by all the money that came in and was spent on new programs So you are basically going to double down on the cost here Our children and our grandchildren are going to have to pay twice not only to pay for the longterm care which allegedly has been promised to these people under these insurance programs but also to pay for all the new spending that will occur as a result of spending the premiums which were supposed to be saved for these programs So they are going to get hit twice The implications are quite honestly staggering We already know we have a 38 trillion unfunded liability in Medicare We know when you combine Medicare Medicaid and Social Security we have a 60 trillion unfunded liability If you calculate in the cost of the CLASS Act on top of that you are adding potentially trillions more of unfunded liability which will all have to be paid by our children and our grandchildren At the essence of this bill there are a number of problems but the problem I find most inappropriate in the way we are doing this is we are creating a government which our kids cannot afford under any circumstance We are absolutely guaranteeing that our children are going to have a lower standard of living than we had because of the burden we are going to put on them as a result of these expansive new programs which we know cannot be afforded in the outyears We already know we cannot afford the government we have in the outyears We already know the public debt is headed above 80 percent of GDP by 2019 So the Senator from South Dakota has touched on a core issue What is the real cost of this Well it is extraordinary As I said it hits the next generation twice First they will have to pay the taxes to pay for the program that was put on the books which is allegedly there plus they will have to pay to support all the programs which the money that came in was supposed to be preserved for I think the Senator from South Dakota touched on another point The sense of the Senate basically confirms the fundamental flaw of the CLASS Act The fact that you would think a sense of the Senate is necessary pretty much proves that everybody around here understands there is a big game going on with the CLASS Act The problem is of course the sense of the Senate has no effect of law and therefore the problems the CLASS Act creates in the area of spending the revenues that come in for the purpose of something other than what the CLASS Act alleges people are buying when they pay for that insurance will still exist and the CBO will still score the CLASS Act as benefiting the budget situation when it should not be scored that way at all As I said this is a nice resolution from a political standpoint but substantively it has no effect on correcting the problems which the CLASS Act generate in the area of fiscal policy I understand there is a unanimous consent request that somebody wishes to offer I was asked if I would listen to it I ask the assistant leader is he offering a unanimous consent request I will yield the floor for the purposes of a unanimous consent request Reserving the right to object my only concern would be that will take us past 7 oclock so you may want to adjust the time Is it my understanding then the order of recognition will be Senator Whitehouse the assistant leader and then Senator Hatch I was just wondering if the Senator would yield for a question Is the Ponzi family from Chicago The first 30 years of the CLASS Act will generate revenues It will add to the Federal Treasury and willand that was the purpose of my discussion that is the point I madeduring the first 30 years of this proposal younger people will be paying in and very few people will be taking out because they will not have yet qualified for the insurance because they will not be old enough to go into assisted living 
S_CO_UDALL,2009-12-20,2009_2009,0065, President I thank the Senator from Montana for yielding I thank him for his tremendous leadership on this important fight here on the floor of the Senate First I commend my colleagues for strapping on their snow gear The Presiding Officer comes from the State of Minnesota where this kind of a storm we have had over the last few days is not that unusual a development I like a good 16inch dusting from time to time We all know what an important issue reforming our health care system is and braving the elements is a small price to pay I have come to the floor a lot over the past few months to discuss the challenges that are facing us as we work toward fixing our broken health care system One overarching theme I continue to emphasize is just how important this is to putting our economy back on track We have a bloated 12 trillion Federal debt which is being fed daily by growing health care costs Every day employers small and large are laying off workers and slashing benefits for their employees Great American businesses especially in our manufacturing sector have nearly collapsed because of the rising costs of providing health care for their workers Those Americans who have coverage lack the peace of mind in knowing that their insurance will be there just when they need it This lack of stability and peace of mind is a fundamental problem with the status quo today because it takes away one of the things valued most by Americans their freedom Today they are reluctant to move to a new job to advance their education or start a small business for fear they wont be able to provide health care for their families As we struggle to mend our economy we cant afford to tell people to stay put We know from history that encouraging the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans is the key to promoting small business creating jobs and driving our economic recovery Small businesses have accounted for 65 percent of all new jobs created in the past 15 years but today anyone who owns or has ever tried to start their own business can attest to why rising health care costs is such a major problem in this country Take for example the story of a gentleman who just recently contacted me from Denver I will pick up on the theme the Senator from Ohio was touching upon If we listened to the people in our States there would be no question that this reform is necessary Dave is a small business owner Last year he saw his insurance premiums skyrocket 27 percent for his employees When he questioned this unbelievable increase his insurance company said all he needed to do to save money was just stop offering coverage to his employees Just let them buy their own insurance his insurance company told him When he looked into that when he checked it out he found out that nearly half of his workforce would be ineligible for coverage because of preexisting conditions and that those who could obtain coverage were priced out and couldnt even afford it I hear this story time and time againsmall business owners who want to do the right thing but end up facing annual doubledigit increases in their costs This is so troubling in this economic time because small businesses pay on average 18 percent more than large employers for the same level of coverage The status quoand the Presiding Officer has been articulate and eloquent and involved in this fightas he knows is unacceptable and we cant kick the can down the road any longer The good news is the legislation we are considering contains essential provisions aimed at helping small businesses individuals and American families across our country Let me touch on a few of the important provisions that are in this final package Health insurers will be organized into wellregulated marketplaces and finally forced to compete This would then involve a creation of a more transparent process for individuals and small businesses so for the first time you can actually compare insurance plans side by side The legislation helps individuals pay for these newfound health insurance options More than half of the cost of reform goes to financing tax credits to put money back in the pockets of middleclass families to help them purchase a health plan As Chairman Baucus has pointed out these tax credits represent the biggest tax cut since 2001 In addition starting in 2010 many small businesses will also qualify for new tax credits worth up to 50 percent of the cost of providing health insurance to their employees Also in this billI cant emphasize this enoughAmericans will no longer go bankrupt because of health care costs We are the only developed country in the world where citizens go bankrupt because they have health care costs they cant afford Insurers will be prohibited from denying access to health care because of preexisting conditions limiting coverage because of age or gender or dropping the insurance someone has already paid for simply because they get sick Regardless of what we hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle this legislation saves money it strengthens Medicare it reduces the deficit and it puts us on a path to finally addressing our growing national debt In fact noted MIT economist Jon Gruber estimates this bill will save small businesses 25 percent or about 65 billion per year on health insurance That translates into 30 billion in takehome pay and an estimated 80000 saved jobs While the bill before us makes important improvements I would also like to say a few words about the package of amendments offered by the distinguished majority leader I took some time as I think we all did over the last snowy 24 hours to familiarize myself with the changes and I wish to touch on some of the most promising revisions that have been made I wish to first note my appreciation for including the freshman package These amendments were offered by myself and the freshman class of which the Presiding Officer is a member and they have attracted bipartisan support They boast the endorsements of business labor and consumer groups The provisions inject more cost containment in the bill cut down on regulatory and bureaucratic redtape and push even more aggressively toward a reformed health care system I am particularly pleased to see a provision I worked on that would expand the scope of a new board designed to strengthen Medicare The amendment would task this board not only to monitor Medicare but to look for ways to improve the entire health care system as a whole I believe the independent payment advisory board is one of the best cost containment tools in the bill and I want to acknowledge Senator Rockefeller for his work in developing the idea as well as Leader Reid for putting even more bite into the authority of this important panel of experts Second I wish to express how proud I am that Majority Leader Reid put so much emphasis in the managers amendment on improving health care in rural America The difficulty of accessing health care in rural communities is a unique struggle I have been increasingly concerned about especially as I have traveled around Colorados rural areas in the past several months I am glad to see the inclusion of an amendment I authored to establish a rural physician pipeline training program designed to help bolster our rural health care workforce Many of my colleagues joined me in offering this important amendment which has the potential to recruit and train more doctors to practice in rural areas In addition I also authored an amendment that would establish an explicitly rural element to the community transformation grant program which is aimed at helping prevent and reduce chronic disease in communities across the country My amendment would ensure that rural areas are getting their share of this critical prevention and wellness funding and I was very proud to see this important change included as well As I begin to close I wish to say that although this bill has been strengthened significantly by the majority leaders efforts it is not perfect But I do not think anyone expects Congress to craft a perfect piece of legislation We could never send the President a bill that fixes all the problems in our health care system or exactly reflects the priorities of every single Member of Congress including myself But what I am confident of is this legislation can establish a sturdy foundation upon which we will build improve and strengthen access to health care in America Will there be mistakes made along the way I do not doubt it But as a lifelong mountain climber I know from experience that the stumbles you experience along the way are a necessary part of reaching any mountaintop Providing insurance and quality care for all our citizens is a onceinalifetime opportunity to improve the health and well being of every American These are the goals of our health insurance reform and over the next few days I look forward to passing a bill which modernizes our health care delivery system increases much needed choice and competition in the health insurance industry and helps put our economy back on track while improving the financial security of middleclass working families I yield the floor 
S_MI_LEVIN,2009-12-20,1979_2009,0366, President first let me thank the Senator from Montana for the extraordinary work he has put in on this bill for so long so many months so many years Thanks also go of course to the Democratic leader our majority leader Senator Dodd and others who have worked so hard to get us here We are in a pivotal moment in the long fight to reform our health care system Everyone should by now be well aware of the historyhow Presidents of both parties have tried and failed to achieve reform and how after months of painstaking review we have arrived at this instant closer than ever to health care reform It would be impossible to fashion legislation on an issue so massive and so complex on which all could agree in every detail Those seeking perfection will have to look outside this Chamber or for that matter in any piece of complex legislation But when they look outside the walls of this Capitol Senators will also find problems that dwarf the imperfections in this bill They will find a broken health care system one in which we pay vastly more than other wealthy nations for care that is in many cases demonstrably inferior They will find Americans struggling to afford the health care coverage they have and employers struggling to provide insurance to their employees They will find manufacturers struggling under a costly health care burden from which their international competitors were long ago freed They will find employee and employer alike plagued by neverending uncertainty about the cost and availability of health insurance an instability that haunts families and hinders job creation They will find costs rising so fast they threaten to swallow the rest of the Federal budget and sink family budgets They will find astonishing amounts of money spent not on better care or innovative treatments but on overhead and bureaucracy They will find millions of Americans with no coverage at alla tragedy for the uninsured and a source of inefficiency and expense that make health care more expensive for all of us So the choice before us now is whether any imperfections we might see in this bill outweigh the mountain of evidence that our current system is in dire need of repair It is between moving forward on a significant repair of a broken system or quashing yet another attempt to reform health care in surrender to the status quo and to the rhetoric of distortion and fear To me this choice is clear We cannot wait any longer for health care reform The people of my State cannot wait The people of this Nation cannot wait Now is the time for all those years of frustrated effort all the research and analysis all the debate and discussion for us to reform a broken system We must vote for cloture on the managers amendment before us and continue to vote for cloture on the endless filibusters that confront us because we cannot wait We cannot wait any longer to reform this system because its costs are out of control In 1990 this Nation 123 percent of its gross domestic product on health care That is 1 in 8 By 2018 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS estimates that figure will increase to 20 percent and 1 in every 5 will go to health care CMS estimates that after spending about 6000 per capita on health care in 2003 we will spend more than 13000 per capita in 2018 more than doubling our perperson expenditures in 15 years This translates directly into unsustainable costs for the American people According to the Kaiser Family Foundation thousands fewer of our businesses are offering insurance than a decade ago a clear sign they can no longer sustain cost increases of 6 percent or more year after year If we do nothing these costs will continue to rise at a rate which will swallow the budgets of families businesses and government We cannot wait any longer because even for those fortunate enough to have insurance where they work they are increasingly unsure it will be there when they need it most Every Member of this body has heard from constituents who thought they had solid health insurance only to find out their insurer had wriggled out of paying for desperately needed care or found a convenient preexisting condition that voided their coverage or capped their coverage so they faced a crushing choice between treatments they had to have and costs they could not afford Even in cases where families have health insurance medical emergencies can leave debilitating costs in their wake According to a study in the American Journal of Medicine 62 percent of all bankruptcies filed in the United States in 2007 involved medical costs and even more compelling threequarters of those bankruptcies involved people who had health insurance when they got sick There can be no more clear sign of the need to act than the fact that having health insurance is no insurance against bankruptcy from medical costs We cannot wait any longer because so much of the enormous cost at the heart of this health care crisis is money spent on that having little or nothing to do with quality care For example for those who purchase insurance in the individual market roughly 30 percent of the costs they pay will stem from the insurance companys administrative expenseson bureaucracy not medicine A 2003 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that in 1999 Americans spent over 1000 per capita on health care administration costsmore than 1000 for every man woman and child in this Nation spent on paperwork and redtape Electronic medical records which make administration more efficient and improve the quality of care are still not in use for most patients Finally we cannot wait any longer because the inefficiencies of our system are crushing us and our budgets and even more pointedly because so many lives are at stake One hundred forty thousand Americans have lost their lives since 2000 because they lacked health insurance We cannot afford to walk down this road any longer We must change direction This bill will do it in a positive way An analysis by the Urban Institute using methodology developed by the Institute of Medicine determined that since 2000 nearly 140000 Americans have lost their lives because they lacked health insurance Other studies show that breast cancer patients stroke victims and other patients are as common sense suggests far more likely to die from their conditions if they lack adequate health insurance These are rigorous studies that bring us to an inescapable conclusion If we fail to act Americans will continue to lose their lives when they need not simply because they dont have adequate health insurance or any health insurance at all For these reasons and many others it is long past time to reform our system The question we must then answer is will we come closer to a health care system worthy of this Nation if we pass this bill I believe we will The legislation before us will reform the insurance system in powerful ways protecting patients from the host of abuses they now so often face We will begin to control spiraling costs in many ways and establish research centers to find new ways to improve care and lower costs We will create powerful incentives to reduce administrative burdens and costs And we will bring millions of Americans into the health care system reducing the number of uninsured and reducing what is both a burden of inefficiency on the system and a moral blemish on our Nation We are out of time and out of excuses Now we must choose Choose between beginning to reform on the one hand and continuing the status quo on the other Our individual problems with this bill cannot be allowed to overshadow the much larger problems with our health care system Near the end of this long path toward health care reform we cannot turn back The Senate needs to move forward Again I thank my good friend from Montana and the other leaders who have made it possible for us to get to this point The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr Udall of Colorado The Senator from Montana is recognized
